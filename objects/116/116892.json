  "text": "Fujiwara Kei was the second Bizen potter honored by the Japanese government as a Living National Treasure, in 1970. He initially worked as a writer and poet and did not turn to ceramics until he was around 40 years old. Fujiwara met with Kaneshige Tōyō and, following his guidance, created works that are reminiscent of the style produced in the Muromachi period (1336–1573).",
