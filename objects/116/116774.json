  "text": "雲起山皆動　\r\n泉流石亦鳴　\r\n年來仙窟裏　\r\n自覺道心生\r\nClouds arise, the mountains now all move!\r\nStreams are flowing, the very stones sing out.\r\nFor years, here in this grotto of the Immortals, Feeling the mind of the Way arise in me.\r\n\r\nThis example belongs to a set of at least two hanging scrolls that are exceptional because they are the tallest of Kodōjin’s landscapes, and they are painted on satin instead of on silk or paper. Satin was frequently employed by the painter and calligrapher Zhang Ruitu (1570–1641), but only around four percent of Kodōjin’s works are on satin. This painting and its counterpart Quiet Mountains on a Slow Day could form a pair of summer (this painting) and winter landscapes, or they might have belonged to a set of four, each portraying a season, only two of which are currently documented.",
