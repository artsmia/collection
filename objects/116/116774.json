  "text": "This work offers compelling interpretations of familiar Chinese themes and pictorial conventions. The ridges of the mountains, nested like the layers of an onion, reference the landscapes of Wang Hui (1632–1717) and Wang Shimin (1592–1680). The bizarre shapes and heavy “Mi dots,” wet brush strokes used to depict misty mountains, imbue the scene with a brooding animism reflected in the accompanying poem: The cloud rises and the mountain screams and scolds; The spring flows and the rocks resonate. I have been living in this immortal’s cave for years, Naturally I cannot help but to entertain a religious feeling. At the end of the winter 1914, I painted and inscribed this at the High Pines Inn.
