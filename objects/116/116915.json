  "text": "The Confucian scholar Doi Gōga painted in an idiosyncratic style that was perhaps inspired by Zen painting, and sometimes inscribed his works with biting admonishments. Characteristic of Gōga’s works are the incorporation of his seals into the pictorial space, a playful device sometimes seen in ukiyo-e prints but rarely in paintings.",
