[Jonathan Chaves]\r\n唯有白雲動　我心歸一聞　超然窮達外　獨坐見空山 {...} (Only the white clouds are moving— / my heart returns to primal peace. / Transcendentally, beyond success and failure, / I sit alone to watch deserted hills.) [Jonathan Chaves]\r\n忽有清機發　吟詩上翠微　夕陽明古逕　松色照寒衣 {...} (Suddenly pure inspiration strikes— / chanting poems I climb the blue green slopes. / Evening sun glows down the ancient path; / pine tree colors illumine my cold robe.) [Jonathan Chaves]\r\n獨徃空山夕　相隨一古琴　水中天上月　雨雨照吾心 {...} (Alone I go up the empty mountain— / evening, and all I bring is my ancient lute. / In stream water, in the sky—two moons, / and this pair now glows within my heart.) [Jonathan Chaves]\r\n初日照門戸　一花高立霜　起来汲寒水　山色遠蒼蒼 {...} (The new sun shines on my gate; / one flower grows there, upright through the frost. / I rise to draw some cold well-water; / mountain colors stretch far away.) [Jonathan Chaves]\r\n我心清不寐　明片在天閒　寂寂虚窓外　秋聲夜動山 {...} (My mind, too clarified for sleep, / the moon appears in heaven. / In the silence outside my empty window / autumn sounds are shaking the mountain tonight.) [Jonathan Chaves]\r\n曲逕通深竹　故人有幽墅　思詩坐雨前　可與青山語 {...} (A winding path leads deep into bamboo / where a friend has a hidden retreat. / Meditating poems we sit as rain comes down; / we can discuss them with these mountains of green.) [Jonathan Chaves]\r\n颯颯空林葉　荒村燈火青　行人不見影　一犬吠寒星 {...} (Soughing, soughing, leaves in the empty wood; / from the deserted village, one lamplight, dim. / The traveler sees not a single shadow; / somewhere a dog barks at the cold stars.) [Jonathan Chaves]\r\n古寺寒燈照　幽人獨坐長　夜深如有鬼　風葉走虚廊 {...} (In the ancient temple, one cold lamp glows; / the hidden one sits alone for hours. / Deep in the night, there seem to be ghosts: / windblown leaves twirling down empty cloisters.) [Jonathan Chaves]\r\n山静雲猶宿　日高門未開　落花幽意動　啼鳥故人来 {...} (…)\r\n客去柴門寂　秋心弄物萃　幽禽啄枯葉　寒日照孤花 {...} (My",
