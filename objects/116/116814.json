  "text": "The wrap-around design on this inrō is interestingly framed by a highly detailed representation of a bamboo blind. The perspective is such that the viewer feels as though he is peeking out from beneath the blind to catch a glimpse of the blossoming plum trees. The scene is executed in takamaki-e with gold and silver powder and colored lacquer over a roiro background.",
