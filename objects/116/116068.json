  "text": "Domenico Tiepolo liked investigating a theme across a great number of freely executed drawings. One large group of sketches featured angels in the clouds. Despite the fleeting quality of this image, the artist signed it as a finished work, which suggests that he recognized a market for his bravura penmanship. The large number of Tiepolo drawings that survive, combined with the obvious rapidity of their making, may give the impression that his hand never stopped moving.",
