  "text": "Kōno Tettō studied Chinese poetry under the prominent poet Yanagawa Seigan (1782–1858). Later, Tettō opened a school and published two volumes of his work, before dying at forty-three years of age. His verse celebrating nature, appearing on this scroll, remains well-known today. Tettō’s forceful style of writing, characterized by angular thrusts, thick, blunt-tipped horizontal strokes, and thin vertical strokes, recalls that of his teacher, and seems somewhat at odds with this lyrical poem.\r\n山猿雪猶寒　春風来 / 水国　浴促待柳條　一 / 一黄金幺\r\nIn the distant mountains the snow is still cold; / The spring wind arrives from the lake country. / It bathes and stimulates the pines and willows, / To create, one by one, threads of gold. \r\n(Trans. Stephen Addiss)",
