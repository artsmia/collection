  "text": "Nothing is known about the painter Iwai Kōun other than that he was born in Nagasaki, the only port town in Japan open to foreigners for trade and residence during the Edo period (1603–1868). Nagasaki paintings reflect a strong influence of Chinese art that arrived here on merchant ships. On the right of this painting, a praying mantis has caught a wasp which it is about to kill. The spectacle is observed by a monkey above in the tree, who is himself watched by another monkey on the far left.",
