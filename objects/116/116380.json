  "text": "観樹知異心　\r\n聴鳥知殊音　\r\n日出見山高　\r\n月來見水深　\r\n風行花自動　\r\n天寒魚自沈　\r\n靜者無雑念　\r\n忘跡理可尋\r\nContemplating, grasping the mind with thoughts of departure, Alone I seek to know extraordinary music.\r\nThe sun emerges—one sees the height of the mountains;\r\nThe moon arrives—one sees the water’s depth.\r\nThe wind blows—all the birds in motion;\r\nThe sky turns cold—fish naturally submerge.\r\nIn serenity, with no wild thoughts, The forgotten path now can be found again.\r\n\t\r\nVery few paintings and calligraphies by Kodōjon can be firmly dated to the 1940s; it is clear that Kodōjin was no longer as prolific as he once was. Quiet Setting of a Mountain Creek from the spring of 1940 is the last detailed landscape by him.",
