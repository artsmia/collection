  "text": "Hundreds of drawings by Cornelis Saftleven survive. More than a third are studies of single figures. Saftleven seems to have relished the humorous possibilities of the slightly awkward pose, and this study of a seated youth displays just that quality. The young man’s fancy garb, slouching posture, smile, and unfocused eyes suggest that he may be a little tipsy and is certainly not properly upholding his gentlemanly status.",
