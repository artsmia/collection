  "text": "For Savoy was commissioned in 2012 from Karen Widnäs by the Savoy Restaurant in\r\nHelsinki, which was designed in 1937 by famous architect Alvar Aalto (Finnish, 1898-\r\n1976) in collaboration with his wife, Aino (Finnish, 1894-1949). It remains one of the\r\npremiere restaurants in Helsinki. In celebration of the restaurant’s 75th anniversary, chef\r\nKari Ahinen wanted to create a Jubilee menu with a complementary dining service, bringing food and design together for the 21st century. For Savoy’s components are\r\nelemental, in keeping with Finnish modern ideals and to showcase the food. However, aspects of nature are a strong part of the design. The starter plate, for example, contains\r\nripple-like rings referencing water, and the plates’ oval forms recall giant water lily pads.\r\nThe shell-shaped dessert bowl is performative, shaped in a manner that causes the sauce\r\nto flow in a spiral. The S-shaped handle of the sauce boat playfully references the first\r\nletter of “Savoy.” The exacting process of slip-casting the service by hand has been\r\nlikened by the artist to “slow food.” Like Aalto’s work and much of Finnish design that\r\nemphasized handcraft, it is simple yet curvaceous.",
