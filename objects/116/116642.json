  "text": "The title of Tanaka’s Tactile Memory series alludes to the feeling experienced when touching a lacquered surface. The delicate, round, red form of this work from the series compellingly suggests flower petals. He formed a mold of the sculpture from Styrofoam, which he discarded after gluing together many layers of hemp cloth with lacquer.",
