  "text": "This painting is by the artist Cai Jia who lived and worked in the Chinese city of Yangzhou in the 18th century. Like many landscape painters before him, Cai chose the theme of eremitism—living in solitude and seclusion—as the theme of his painting.  \r\nThroughout Chinese history, many highly educated people chose to retire from professional and social life in order to devote themselves to quiet pastimes of self-cultivation and study. This painting shows such a gentleman in his hermitage high on a mountain surrounded by trees that grow in great profusion. Below, a fellow recluse makes his way along the pathway en route to pay his friend a visit. ",
