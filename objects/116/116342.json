  "inscription": "落日蒼天色　寒山啼鳥聲　蕭蕭紅葉下　冉冉白雲生　獨往情無極　高秋老益清　因看明月出　偶訪道人行 (Setting sunlight darkens heaven\\'s color; / cold mountains, sounds of singing birds. / Sighing, soughing, red leaves tumble; / curling, rising, white clouds emerge. / Alone I go forth, feelings without limit: / autumns seem still purer as I grow old. / And now I see the bright moon rising-- / this is the time to visit a man of Tao.)
