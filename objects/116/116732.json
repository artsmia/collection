  "text": "Rendered in varying shades of black and gray, this work shows Fukuda Kodōjin’s extreme use of spatial contrasts. By employing different angles for foreground, center, and background, he creates a complex composition with multiple vantage points. Along the rocks I search for fish where water’s clear and shallow; Beyond the clouds I hear the birds where trees spread in profusion. I go out my gate to enjoy myself, then return back home; As setting sunlight shines through the window again I read my books. (Trans. by Jonathan Chaves)",
