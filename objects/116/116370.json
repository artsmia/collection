  "inscription": "青山囲四壁　中有読書寮　竹樹含寒翠　梅花照寂寥　清泉汲無尽　明月來不招　独坐耽吟詠　因知道味饒 (Green mountains encircle me—four walls, / Enclosing a hut for reading books. / Bamboo trees imbued with blue-green colors, / Plum blossoms glimmering through the silence. / A pure stream provides limitless water, / The brilliant moon comes without being called: / Here alone I sit, enjoying chanting poetry, / And realizing the richness of the flavor of Tao.)
