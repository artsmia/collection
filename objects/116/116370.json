  "inscription": "青山衛四壁　中有讀書寮　竹樹含翠微　梅花照寂寥　清泉汲無盡　明月來不招　獨坐耽吟詠　因知道味饒\r\n{?}\r\n(Green mountains encircle me—four walls,\r\nEnclosing a hut for reading books.\r\nBamboo trees imbued with blue-green colors,\r\nPlum blossoms glimmering through the silence.\r\nA pure stream provides limitless water,\r\nThe brilliant moon comes without being called:\r\nHere alone I sit, enjoying chanting poetry,\r\nAnd realizing the richness of the flavor of Tao.)\r\n[Jonathan Chaves]",
