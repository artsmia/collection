  "text": "Artist Sarah Jones has always been interested in the formal dimensions of photography, which is seen in the clarity, compositions and printing quality of The Rose Gardens (display: III/white) (II) and (III). These elements draw attention to the medium’s illusions and weird spaces. In Rose Gardens, the same rose bush is seen from the front and the back, providing a simultaneous perspective only available via a camera image.",
