  "text": "A professional painter, Yan Hui was especially known for his figure paintings of religious subjects. Here he depicted Sakyamuni (left), an Indian prince from the 400s BCE, whose teaching forms the underpinnings of Buddhism; and Bodhidharma (right), an Indian sage from the 500s CE, who advocated practicing meditation as a means of achieving spiritual enlightenment. Sakyamuni’s quiet, introspective character is suggested by his downcast eyes and gently inclined head, whereas Bodhidharma’s aggressive nature is conveyed by his direct gaze. Yan’s choice of red for the robes of both holy men provides a visual connection between the two paintings.",
