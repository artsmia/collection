  "text": "Beneath a full moon, a scholar wanders alone. He follows a path that cuts between a rock face, to his left, which gives way to dark peaks that billow up toward the moon like smoke, and a crashing waterfall, to his right, described with a single stroke of a wide brush, its hairs splayed. To capture the amorphous forms of foreground rocks and moonlit peaks, Kodōjin used a wet brush to apply many short strokes, one on top of the other. This technique can be understood to be a modified form of “Mi dots,” a technique for describing the texture of rocky surfaces derived from paintings by the Chinese painter Mi Fu (1051–1107).",
