  "text": "Liudmila & Nelson, a husband and wife artistic collaborative, reside in Cuba and address many aspects of Cuban culture and history in their multimedia work. The Absolut Revolution series utilizes the monument to Jose Marti – a writer, political activist and national hero who became a symbol for Cuban independence from Spain in the 19th century – as a central subject to create various artworks in multiple formats. Their video draws on the deadpan and fixed presentation of objects found in conceptual art videos and the repetition of forms associated with minimal art and photograph. The monument, a tall obelisk, stands in isolation surrounded by water and serves as a symbol for the political history of Cuba. The series’ title refers to the Western advertising campaign for Absolut vodka, which uses the similar tall shape of a liquor bottle as a marketing tool. But the artists suggest that little is “absolute” about Cuba’s revolution, which has clearly failed.",
