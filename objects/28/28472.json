  "text": "This stoneware vessel is a relatively direct imitation of a type of bronze wine ewer called <I>hu</I>. The ceramic served as a substitute in the tomb for contemporary objects made of more precious materials like bronze and lacquer. Works made expressly for entombment with the dead are known as <I>ming qi</I> in China. Generally, these wares were unsuitable for daily use. A wide variety of bronze shapes including <I>ding<I> tripods, basins, <I>hu</I> storage jars, bells, weights, and ewers like this one were produced during the Warring States period (475-221 BCE).",
