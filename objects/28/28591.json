  "text": "Poul Henningsen originally created the PH Artichoke Lamp for the interior of the Langelinie Pavilion, a lakeside pavilion built in Copenhagen in 1958 with a mid-century design. The form of the globe artichoke inspired the lamp, comprised of seventy-two overlapping copper panels, or leaves, hung from twelve vertical metal arches. Itâ€™s sprayed pink underneath for light diffusion. This is one of the larger and more commanding examples of the design. The overall effect is layered, sculptural, and dramatic, showing the growing liveliness of Nordic design after World War II ended in 1945.",
