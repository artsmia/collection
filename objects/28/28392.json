  "text": "The weavers of San Juan Comalapa produce two distinct styles of huipil. The mero (pure) Comalapa huipil is distinguished by the use of a cuyuscate (natural brown cotton) or white ground, a bright red creya (band) at the shoulders and rujiki 7al bands of narrow stripes) separating rows of patterning. The newer sanmartineco (in the style of San Mart√≠n) huipil is totally different with its indigo, black, or green ground cloth and the use of modern, naturalistic floral imagery. Both styles have everyday and a festive versions which are differntiated by subtle nuances. The ceremonial mero Comalapa huipil is very large and is worn like a poncho over an everyday huipil. The festive sanmartineco huipil has elaborate floral designs brocaded in silk or sedalina yarn rather than cotton",
