  "text": "The women of San Pedro Sacatepéquez in the department of San Marcos wear distinctive, shimmering yellow skirts and their ceremonial huipiles show a decidedly Spanish influence. Commercially made lace forms a wide collar and trims the armholes on the garment and the white-on-white brocade that decorates the lower section is very reminiscent of European aesthetics. The repeating 'bird and tree' patterns are nearly identical to those found in 16th century European embroidery pattern books. Multi-petal rosettes applied to the shoulders, front and back resemble the sun and moon imagery found in other villages, however, and the rayed star motif is classic Maya.\r\nSan Pedro is a center for foot-loom weaving in the Guatemalan Highlands and the women of this town sew their traje from cloth produced in this manner. Their belts come from Totonicapán, another site of commercial weaving.",
