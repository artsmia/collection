  "text": "Wang Yuan-ch'i was born in Tai-ts'ang, Kiangsu, into a family of prominent scholar-officials, including his grandfather, Wang Shih-min (1592-1680), the important orthodox, literati painter. Wang, in fact, studied the classics and painting under his grandfather's tutelage. He held several important court appointments and was eventually grouped with his grandfather, Wang Hui and Wang Chien, as one of the Four Major Wangs of the Ch'ing dynasty. While best known for his orthodox landscape painting, Wang was accorded the title of \"three superlatives\" (<I>san chueh</I>) meaning good in poetry, painting, and calligraphy. In the classical verse seen here, Wang writes in the relatively formal <I>k'ai-shu</I>(or <I>chen shu</I>) script. His characters are clearly structured and well-balanced conveying a conservative air.\r\n",
