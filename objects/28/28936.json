  "text": "This vase represents the dragon’s shift from a highly spiritual creature to a decorative element, acting here as extremely stylized handles for an otherwise simple form. The creature’s auspicious power persists, however, as a subtle representation of thousands of years of Chinese history. \r\n\r\nThe vase itself is cast in a precisely symmetrical form, reflecting the high value that was placed on form and perfection during later imperial China. The surface of the vessel is decorated with gold that appears to be splashed upon it, a common decorative technique in Qing dynasty bronze artwork. This vase was used for flowers placed on an altar.",
