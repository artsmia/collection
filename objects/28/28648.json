  "text": "Bands, such as these, were made by nomadic Turkic peoples throughout Asia. A migratory life style necessitated the ability to create everything from utilitarian tying bands to elaborate tent hangings and festive clothing.\r\n\r\nTying bands were made in a variety of styles from very basic, to be used to secure bundles to animals and stabilize tent structures, to very elaborate forms.  Bands such as this one would have been used for special occasions such as weddings or for celebrations when several tribes would come together for large gatherings. The textiles on view at such communal events were public indicators of wealth and social status as well as personal aesthetic statements.",
