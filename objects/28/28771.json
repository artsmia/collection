  "text": "Celadon glazed ram-shaped vessels are known from as early as the eastern Wu dynasty (222-280). This vessel was made by joining together sections pulled on the potter's wheel and finished with carving and appliqu√©. Most ram-shaped vessels from this era have small holes in the top of their head suggesting they might have been used as lamps. Their actual purpose however has still not been fully determined.",
