  "text": "When Vicke Lindstrand arrived at Orrefors in 1928, he designed for the traditional copper-wheel engraving technique employed by Simon Gate and Edward Hald since the 1920s, but he introduced a new dynamism not seen in their work. <I>Shark Killer</I> was one of several variations on a theme Lindstrand developed in the 1930s that featured muscular male figures and used the surface of the glass as part of the overall design. The ingenious effect is clear--the swimmer looks across to the other side of the vase at his adversary.",
