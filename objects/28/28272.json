  "text": "Quetzaltenango women's ceremonial huipiles are unique in that they are worn as veils rather than as blouses. The garment is draped over the woman like a poncho and her face is positioned in the circular opening. These dramatic huipiles are used both as wedding clothes and for Cofradía rituals, but the embroidered ribbon that faces the opening features images, presumably, of Adam and Eve, which make it likely that this particular piece was used as a wedding garment.",
