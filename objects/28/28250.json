  "text": "A leading caricaturist of her day, Peggy Bacon was a perceptive observer of the human condition. Here, a middle-age woman adds the “finishing touches” of her daily toilette as she rides the New York subway, oblivious to her public surroundings. Bacon’s fictional portrayal addresses vanity or inflated pride, one of the seven deadly sins in Christian teachings.",
