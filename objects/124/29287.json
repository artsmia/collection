  "text": "In most examples of masked performance in Africa, the dancer wears some sort of body covering in addition to the mask. Museums often display the masks alone, but here we have the opposite: a costume lacking the wooden mask that would have accompanied it. During the Nigerian Igbo festival called “Fame of the Maidens, ” male dancers embody the ideals of youthful feminine beauty through their masks, costumes, and movements. The appliqué designs in vivid colors refer to female body ornamentation, traditionally a combination of scarification and body paint. \r\nThis costume, created for a small person, was originally made in two parts and later joined.",
