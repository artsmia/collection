  "text": "“A Promoter and Preserver of Good Health, ” the Sun-Kraft table sun lamp was advertised for its ability to treat a variety of skin conditions, arthritis, sluggish blood circulation and respiratory ailments through the healing properties of ultra violet radiation (found naturally in sunlight). It also claimed men and women could benefit from sounder sleep, smoother skin and a general sense of wellbeing. Used on babies, it was said to promote healthy development. In 1945 Sun Kraft was sued for false advertising. Settled against the company, Sun Kraft was required to relabel it under the supervision of the Food and Agriculture Administration. Today, UV rays are known as the primary cause of skin cancer.",
