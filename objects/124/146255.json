  "text": "Los Angeles-based artist Carole Caroompas felt that artists should make art without worrying about critics or playing to exhibitions. Artists were supposed to assault the senses or change the world. This painting is a good example of Caroompas's values. It is rigorously designed and shows off her skill and imagination. Using an approach akin to collage, she has hand painted imagry from multiple sources to make a startling painting about the body under attack by viruses. Made during the AIDS epidemic, the painting is part of a series that questions male control of women's bodies and the pathologizing of sexuality.",
