  "text": "Katō Tsubusa’s family has been making ceramics since the Momoyama Period (1573–1615) but he did not want to pursue that career at first. After travelling extensively in his youth, he decided to pursue ceramics and graduated from the Tajimi City Ceramic Design Institute in 1979. He initially worked in a studio creating mass-produced pots. Five years later, Katō became independent, built his own kiln, and concentrated entirely on porcelain. He was able to enter group exhibitions like the Asahi Ceramic Art Exposition and has solo exhibitions since 1989. Traditional porcelain is cherished for its elegance and refinement, but Katō succeeded to bring it to a new level with dramatic forms that can have razor-sharp edges.",
