  "text": "In East Asia, the orchid appears frequently not just because of its beauty, but also for its cultural significance. In China, the flower was considered one of the four gentlemen (in Chinese, sijunzi)—along with bamboo, chrysanthemum, and plum—that represented the noble virtues of true literati. The four plants also constituted the basis of art education: their simple forms allowed beginners to practice the fundamental strokes of painting. Here, Chokunyū represents orchids in just a few brushstrokes in varying degrees of ink wash.",
