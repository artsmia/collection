  "text": "In this surimono, a type of print often commissioned by private poetry groups, lines of poetry are juxtaposed with a row of dancers in colorful kimono. Dressed as Ōharame, literally women from the Ōhara district, who come to the sell their hometown products such as flowers and firewood in the city streets of Kyoto, the figures depicted here are actually men performing a Kyōgen play. Staged in the spring, this play, titled Wakana (Young Greens), is among the most popular as it features a scene with colorfully dressed women carrying flowers, which is appropriately happy and funny.",
