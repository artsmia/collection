  "text": "This extremely simple composition is one Japan’s most iconic artworks, and arguably Hokusai’s most powerful and enigmatic rendering of Mount\r\nFuji. Showing a solitary mountain in russet tones, it is nicknamed “Red\r\nFuji (Aka Fuji ). The title South Wind, Clear Weather indicates that the\r\nmountain takes on such an appearance at sunrise during summer, when\r\na warm breeze from the south blows across Japan. In his Fuji series, Hokusai had no interest in actually representing nature as it was, but was\r\nrather more intent on creating dramatic views like this one, where he\r\nmade the mountain much steeper than it actually is. Since he did not\r\nsketch from life, it seems somewhat pointless to try to track down the\r\nactual location for every view. Even so, however, the location for this\r\nparticular view is generally believed to be situated somewhere north or\r\nnortheast of the mountain, in today’s Yamanashi Prefecture.",
