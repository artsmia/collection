  "text": "There are six major divisions among the Indé (Apache) peoples.  Of them, the Jicarilla and Western Indé are most known for their baskets.  The Western Indé construct coils made from cottonwood that are stitched with willow and devil's claw.  Their baskets chief value is in its size and perfection of a streamline shape.  Like their Piman neighbors, most Western Indé baskets were made for Euro-American customers by the turn of the century.  Their two primary forms are shallow bowls and vase-shaped baskets.  Simple baskets with modest designs were characteristic of the years between 1860 and 1890.  The black rim of devil's claw is a common feature on Western Indé baskets. Designs on bowls radiate from the center, and in between the radiating spokes, Western Indé basket makers are known to add figures of dogs, deer or humans to their designs.",
