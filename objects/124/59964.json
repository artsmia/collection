  "text": "Cut from a section of naturally occurring root, this hardwood brushpot takes on an irregular form that would have appealed to a scholar's taste for interesting objects found in nature. In this case, the natural excrescent botes of the root surrounded by the contorted lineal grain of the surface resembles rocks in a fast flowing torrent. Seeking to find the large within the small, a scholar would have delighted in the implied forces of nature seen here with the soft, swift moving water weathering the hardest of rocks in its path.",
