  "text": "High-fired ceramics with a green-blue celadon glaze were introduced to the Korean peninsula from China in the tenth century. Within a century or two, Korean artisans had developed their own distinctive tradition of celadon ware—the only variety of high-fired ware produced in the Goryeo period—that received high praise even from the Chinese. The inside of this thin-bodied bowl is decorated with an elegant design of flowers and leaves applied with a mold.",
