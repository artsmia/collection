  "text": "Willem van Konijnenburg was a Dutch symbolist who combined mysticism and mathematics, using proportion and rhythm to explore the struggle between good and evil.\r\n\r\nBesides being a visual artist, Van Konijnenburg was a dancer. In 1919, he exhibited a series of five large drawings that combined his interests, depicting a series of dances on timeless themes: Youth, War, Witchcraft, Rituals, and this drawing—Predestination or Fate. Here the athletic figures are subject to forces clearly beyond their control. Some rocket through the air, trying to escape the underworld, while others are not so fortunate. The dances mathematical choreography reveals itself in the insistent diagonals of the composition, especially those drawn corner to corner.",
