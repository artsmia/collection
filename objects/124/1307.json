  "text": "This plate is decorated with a scene of a hunter, a lady, and a man in the tree picking cherries and is derived from a print by Jean Michel Moreau le Jeune (1741-1814). This print was also used by the Meissen porcelain factory during the 1760s.\r\n\r\nThis soup plate and other objects in these cases were once owned by one of the most serious collectors of Chinese export porcelain in America, Helena Woolworth McCann. Mrs. McCann left her collection to a number of museums, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and museums in Boston, Brooklyn, Buffalo, Chicago, Dallas, Detroit, Hartford, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Louisville, Norfolk, Providence, Richmond and Springfield. The Winfield Foundation served as the executor of her estate.",
