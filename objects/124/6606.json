  "text": "In Korean culture, the phoenix (bonghwang) symbolizes good fortune, peace, harmony, and immortality. Porcelain, known as white ware (baekja) in Korea, was prized by the elites and royals during the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910). The use of cobalt blue for underglaze decoration began in the 15th century and remained popular throughout the dynasty.",
