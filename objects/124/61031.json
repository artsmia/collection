  "text": "The Tsistsistas are known for their well-crafted footwear, which often have beaded images drawn from traditional life.  A red bird has been beaded on the upper portion of the moccasins shown here, referencing the Thunderbird, a being that is important in the Tsistsistas cosmos.  Beaded on the other moccasins is a red cross, which does not represent Christianity, instead symbolizes the Morning Star, another figure in Tsistsistas traditions.",
