  "text": "Guillaumin found success as a professional artist in Paris, exhibiting at the Salon des Refusés in 1873 and regularly with the Impressionists between 1874 and 1886. Committed to painting directly from nature, he captured landscapes and gardens just outside Paris and in the south of France. Although Guillaumin is lesser known than his friends Camille Pissarro and Paul Cezanne, his bold brushwork and expressive use of color had a profound influence on the next generation of artists. His paintings are mentioned in dozens of letters exchanged between Vincent van Gogh and his brother Theo.",
