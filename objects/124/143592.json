  "text": "Yodo River was an important thoroughfare to connect Kyoto with Osaka and was used for transporting goods as well as people, but no humans are depicted in this remarkably abstract view of the section flowing through Fushimi in Kyoto. Limiting the palette to gold, blue, and green tones, bamboo, clouds, mountains, and sail boats are the only elements, created on top of a layer of thin gold leaf. The artist created a clever composition because both sides of the pair connect and there is no fixed left or right placement; indeed, the pair could even be arranged in a circle for a person to sit in the middle and enjoy the continuous scene.",
