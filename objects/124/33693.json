  "text": "Cast after an ancient Han or Six Dynasties (206 BCE–618 CE) design, this scholar’s water dropper is in the form of a tortoise holding a small cup in its mouth. The creature is surmounted by a snake inlaid with gold and silver strips. In combination, the snake and tortoise represent the North, or the “dark warrior.” In spite of the patterned inlay, the animals are realistically cast. The tortoise is even anatomically correct, with scales and plastron (abdominal shell) on the underside.\r\n\r\nWater droppers were used to add water to the inkstone; the solid ink was then ground into the water, forming liquid ink.",
