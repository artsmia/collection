  "text": "In the 1995 catalogue of his retrospective at the Krefeld Museum in Germany Jack stresses once again his conviction that design is the whole of it; the pattern and the process, the materials and finish, application and existence over time.  Pattern or motif, is just one aspect of design preferably in the cloth rather than on it.   (Jack Larsen, p 12 of Krefeld cat.)<P>\r\nTo gain a full appreciation of the verity of this concept one has only to look at the <I>Novara</I> pattern copy right in 1981 and developed into two totally different fabrics, an Upholstery and a casement.  Working with a German mill, using a high tech jacquard loom and textured chenille yarn, the Larsen studio produced a heavy weight, almost sculptural fabric.  Concurrently working in India with local craftspersons and traditional tools the same pattern was transformed into a fine casement using a clipped weft technique thus creating both opaque and translucent areas.",
