  "text": "Aristide Maillol devoted himself to the female nude, working primarily in sculpture but also drawing and printmaking. He consciously stripped away literary associations and context to focus exclusively on the sensual form. The model seen here is Dina Vierny. 60 years younger than Maillol, she was his muse for the last decade of his life. \r\n \r\nIn World War II, she worked for the French Resistance. When Maillol found out, he showed her back country routes to smuggle refugees through the Pyrenees. When she was arrested, Maillol hired lawyers who secured her release. Realizing that Dina, a Jew, was in serious danger, he sent her to model for Matisse but called her back when Matisse made plans to occupy her with an extended project.",
