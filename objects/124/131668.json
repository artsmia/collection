  "text": "Shibori is a form of resist dyeing that relies on a collection of tying, folding, twisting, stitching, and binding techniques to render some areas of a textile inaccessible to dye when immersed in an indigo bath. Used skillfully in combination or succession, it can create precise, regular patterns or larger-scale motifs such as fish and flowers. Shibori arrived in the 17th century in the town of Arimatsu, where it became a production center. Because Arimatsu was on a main road, shibori quickly spread far and wide. \r\nThis undergarment shows the results of a wide variety of approaches, including tying (which creates rings), folding and stitching (which creates the lines of alternating white circles), and stitching around paper inserts (which creates the lozenge- or petal-like forms).",
