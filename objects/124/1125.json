  "text": "The large animal mask in the central panel of this <I>gui</I> is broad and has a vertical ridge and an incised diamond in the center. It has a pair of large C-shaped horns and an open mouth that exposes a pair of fangs. The beaked dragons occupying the neck and foot belts have the unusual feature of an additional plume, which hangs down from the curled-up tail. The handles are topped with rams’ heads and terminate at the bottom with a C-hook. The most interesting feature of the vessel is the decor on the bottom surface. It is a coiled dragon, in threadlike relief, with a rolled-up nose and a body adorned with a row of big scales.",
