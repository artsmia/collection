  "text": "Born in Hangzhou, Lan Ying at an early age was determined to become a famous painter. While classified as a highly skilled professional artist, perhaps the last important Zhe school painter, Lan Ying also had deep historical knowledge of past painting styles. He had close contact with literati luminaries like Sun Kehong (1532-1610), Dong Qichang, and Chen Jiru (1558-1639) who shared their opinions with the younger artist and opened their collections of old paintings to him.\r\n<P>Lan Ying was essentially a professional painter however, and this work depicting a summer landscape shows more decorative brushwork, richer colors, and mannered landscape elements than typically encountered in the Qing orthodox tradition. Be this as it may, Lan Ying still pays homage to past literati masters by referencing the famous fourteenth century master, Huang Gongwang, in his inscription.",
