  "text": "The Olmec people developed the first cities of Mesoamerica.  Situated in the tropical lowlands of Mexico, these early urban societies produced most of the major features of later regional civilizations: monumental architecture and sculpture, hieroglyphic writing, a calendrical system, and intensive agriculture.  The distinctive Olmec art style, expressive of their religion, greatly influenced subsquent Mesoamerican art.<P>A prominent motif in Olmec art is the baby face, a fleshy human face with drooping mouth, squinting eyes, and snub nose.  Here the distinctive features are part of a naturalistic depiction, but in many Olmec pieces they merge with feline traits like snarling lips and fangs.  These pervasive references to the spiritual union of a jaguar and a human allude to an Olmec conception of the supernatural status of rulers.",
