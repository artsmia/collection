  "text": "As a native of Washington state, Jim Hodges grew up close to nature, a point of departure that has long informed his work. A common thread in his practice is a poetic consideration of life’s many mysteries, including birth, death, love, and the inevitability of change. During a four‑year collaboration with Highpoint Editions, Hodges embraced the changing conditions of nature as inspiration for a series of four multimedia prints representing the seasons. In these prints, Hodges demonstrates an instinctive understanding of materials and methods, merging form, color, and texture in complex, layered compositions that mirror the inherent beauty and intricacies of the natural world. Though strongly abstracted, each print captures an essential quality of its respective season, a fleeting moment that evokes our own memories and experiences. For Hodges, the seasons symbolize cycles of growth and decay, the inevitable change and renewal that defines life itself.",
