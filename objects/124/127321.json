  "text": "When Mori Aya created this sculpture in 2017, it was the largest piece she had ever attempted. Inspired by the branch-like form and slow, rhythmic movement of a type of slime mold called physarum, she built the dramatic, detailed form by hand and used a traditional namako (“sea cucumber”) glaze in deep, lustrous blue that drips to bright green and warm brown in the work's crevices and folds.",
