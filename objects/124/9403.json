  "text": "Some of the earliest Qingbai ware was simply decorated with freely executed incisions outlining the motif, usually floral, set off with incised comb patterns. Similar use of comb striations can be found in other Song ceramics including Yaozhou celadon and Cizhou wares. Delicately potted, lightly incised, and subtlety glazed, this small bowl reflects the aesthetic refinement Qingbai could achieve within what was essentially a mass manufactured utilitarian ware with broad public appeal.",
