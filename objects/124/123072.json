  "text": "Featuring more than two dozen unique drawings (some double-sided) and a selection of commercial ephemera, this remarkable James Castle “bundle” work is essentially a portable exhibition in a box. Most of the drawings are portraits or figurative compositions, though subjects include abstractions, landscapes, and an ocean liner. The selection incudes both color and black-and-white examples. Castle fashioned the exterior and tray of the box from a discarded carton of Cheer laundry detergent. It is nearly identical to the cardboard boxes of wooden kitchen matches that he favored as substrates for his soot drawings. But for him, everything had to be unique and handmade.\r\n\r\nThe idea of organizing and storing drawings in discrete packages extended to the long-term storage of Castle’s artwork. He routinely stacked and tied finished works of art in bundles and then placed them in the family’s attic or in barns or outbuildings. He often set the bundles on open beams or placed them inside walls. The storage of small-scale drawings and items of commercial ephemera inside a discrete handmade box speaks to this penchant for preservation and categorization. Its intended purpose is unknown, though it may have operated as a miniaturized drawing exhibition.",
