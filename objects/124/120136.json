The gleaming polish that distinguishes this type of column has degraded due to white surface deposits. There are also several large cracks that, if not repaired, could lead to future damage. Once restored, the columns will make a dramatic statement in Mia's South and Southeast Asian galleries, providing a physical gateway to the gallery space. \r\n\r\nContact the Chinese, South and Southeast Asian Art Department at CSSAA@artsmia.org or (612) 870-3220 to Champion this artwork.",
