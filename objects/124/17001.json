  "text": "This parrot, like many of the Moche ceramics, is realistically portrayed yet embedded with cultural significance. In this case, the parrot may symbolize shamanic transformations or journeys to other spiritual realms. This whistling jar consists of two chambers connected to one another by a narrow passageway. The jar will whistle by either blowing air through the spout or by tipping the liquid from side to side.",
