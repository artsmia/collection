  "text": "As the Lakȟóta world became more and more restricted because of Euro-American expansion, Lakȟóta women focused their time and energy on larger-scale art projects like the completely beaded yoke found on this three-hide dress. Lakȟóta women wore these dresses to ceremonies or when they would come together to dance and celebrate with their communities and families. The weight of this dress, probably about 20 pounds, was easily supported by these strong and remarkable women. They were accustomed to putting up and taking down tipis, scraping and tanning buffalo hides, and moving the entire contents of their homes quickly and efficiently.",
