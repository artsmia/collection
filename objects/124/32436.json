  "text": "The deep bowl of this food-offering vessel is set on a high slender foot with matching cover to form a sphere. The upper half has three faceted projections that serve as tripod legs when the cover is turned over for use as a bowl. All elements are decorated with fine linear scroll motifs, fretwork patterns, and triangular panels that vaguely recall earlier bronze styles and motifs.\r\n<P>With the dispersal of wealth and political authority during the Eastern Zhou (c. 770–256 BCE), the number of local foundries increased and workshops developed regional styles. Variety was a hallmark of the era. This vessel was made in the State of Yan (in present-day Beijing). Artisans looked to earlier bronze-casting traditions and revived certain elements of animal-based decoration like the cicada-inspired triangle panels on this <I>dou</I>.",
