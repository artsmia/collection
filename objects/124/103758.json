  "text": "Born in St. Paul, Minnesota, Alexis Fournier received his earliest art training first as a sign painter and then as a student under Douglas Volk, the Minneapolis College of Art and Design's initial director. \r\n\r\nAfter establishing himself as a successful working artist, Fournier moved to Paris to study painting at the acclaimed Academie Julien. His time in France had a direct influence upon his work. Exposure to the artists of the Barbizon school and French Impressionism resulted in a loose, painterly approach that became the hallmark of his style. After his return to the States, he was frequently referred to as the last American Barbizon Painter.",
