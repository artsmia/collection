  "text": "The frequency and exceptional sculptural quality of the pottery horses found in Tang burials testifies to the importance attributed to the animal by contemporary society. This pair of horses is portrayed standing quietly on an integrated plinth. Upon a layer of gesso, creamy-white and brown pigments are painted respectively, and the facial detail, mane, body hair and tail, as well as muscles are each painted carefully.",
