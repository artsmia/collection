  "text": "This painting depicts the death of Sakyamuni, the historical Buddha, in 438 BCE. The Indian prince-turned-sage is shown lying on his side, having delivered his final teachings. At the moment of his death, the Buddha was said to enter nirvana, a stage attained through the extinction of desire and individual consciousness. Around him are disciples in monks’ robes, a group of five bodhisattvas—beings that compassionately refrain from entering nirvana in order to save others—with golden-yellow skin, guardian deities, monks, laymen, and animal beings. All are shown expressing profound grief. The square “Kunju” relief seal dates this painting to a time before the artist, Itchō, was exiled to a small island in Izu province in 1699.",
