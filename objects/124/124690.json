  "text": "Conservation was generously funded by Larry Oakey\r\n\r\nKirchner frequently lived and worked in Switzerland after 1920. He was a formative influence on the Swiss Expressionist group, Rot-Blau (Red-Blue), which had established itself in Basle. He painted a number of city views in 1926 including Mia’s <I>View of Dresden: Schlossplatz</I>. A later <I>View of Bern</I>, a Swiss city he preferred over Zurich, is also in the collection. These three city views were painted in the “tapestry style” Kirchner adopted in the 1920s, in which his colors became purer, lighter and more independent of each other.",
