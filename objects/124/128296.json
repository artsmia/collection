  "text": "Kitamura Junko's approach to ceramic inlay is so radically different from traditional inlaid wares that they defy conventional categorization. Instead, her inspiration likely stems from the textile and lacquer designs she encountered while growing up in Kyoto, a longstanding center for craft production in Japan. After shaping her vessels on the potter's wheel, she applies a coat of dark gray or black slip. Once the clay is leather-hard, she uses a homemade bamboo tool to carve small divots into the surface. After a bisque firing, she coats the vessel with white slip. When dry, she scrapes away the excess slip before firing the piece a final time. Kitamura's imaginative designs and labor-intensive technique have earned her considerable praise and admiration.",
