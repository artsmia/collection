  "text": "Piranesi added this plate and plate II to the series in 1761, when he was reworking the original fourteen plates. The two new plates reflect his increasing familiarity with the art of Roman antiquity, which played a much more prominent role in these new images. Enormous reliefs of lions populate the foreground, and to the left a captured prisoner, though made of stone, seems to react to the sinister view before him.",
