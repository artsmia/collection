  "text": "Hidaka Tetsuō was a monk and painter who studied Chinese painting. He traveled through Kyoto, Osaka, and Edo at the age of 56, and along the way befriended Yasuda Rōzan (whose work is on display nearby). The title of this painting refers to a painting by Juran, a Chinese landscape painter active in the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period (907–79). In this painting, Hidaka paid tribute to the legendary Chinese painter, whose work he never saw. Here, he rendered the mist-like clouds, which glide through the mountains, with ink wash.",
