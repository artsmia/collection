  "text": "Two women are represented fighting for their lives in this scene from Goya’s Disasters of War. One stabs a fallen soldier, the other is ferociously wrestled to the ground. Goya boldly employed a coarsely granulated aquatint on this plate, which sets the violent scene in a dystopian moonscape, a world obscured by an explosive pattern of tone and light.",
