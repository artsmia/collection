  "text": "Widely regarded as a leading figure in the field of Bizen ceramics, Kakurezaki Ryūichi’s work is beloved also for its departures from tradition. Such is the case with this massive platter, notable for its spinous projections and oozing, lustrous palladium glaze. Kakurezaki graduated from the Osaka University of the Arts and apprenticed with Living National Treasure ceramic artist Isezaki Jun (born 1936) before establishing his own kiln in 1985. His solo shows have been held in Tokyo and the United States. A major retrospective of Kakurezaki’s work was held at the prestigious Musée Tomo in Tokyo in 2014.",
