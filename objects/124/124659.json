  "text": "In the 1940s, Alexander Calder explored surrealist compositions based on floating hieroglyphic forms. In the 60s, he returned to such compositions but with brightly colored, simplified elements that resonated with the Pop Art of the time. The title Fronton refers to the court used for the fast-paced Basque sport of jai alai, in which players use gloves with banana-shaped basket extensions to catch and propel a ball with breathtaking speed.",
