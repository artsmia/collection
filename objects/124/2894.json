  "text": "The shape of the hat and the imagery of frogs are typical of Bamum prestige hats, but it is known that in the early twentieth century, Bamum artists made similar hats for the court of the neighboring kingdom of Nso. The three large frogs appliqued on this hat symbolize power, royalty, and fertility. Only the king, descendants of royalty, and elite dignitaries would wear this type of hat.",
