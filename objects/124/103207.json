Wrapped around the waist so that the flowered end panels hang down in front, this type of sash became popular with north Indian courtiers in the mid-1600s and remained fashionable for the next 250 years. The sash's pastel hues and <I>lahariya</I> design were appropriate for <I>Holi</I>, a Hindu festival marking the end of the cold season and onset of spring.",
