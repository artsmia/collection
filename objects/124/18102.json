  "text": "Sultan Mahmud, one of the most important patrons of Persian art and literature, arrives at the city gates of Gananj on horseback with his entourage in 1017.  Mahmud had commissioned Ferdowsi to write the 50, 000 verse <I>Shah Nama (Book of Kings)</I>, and journeyed to Gananj to pay Ferdowsi the gold due him for his thirty-five year effort. Unfortunately, the great poet had just died and was thus denied the honor the Sultan intended to bestow on him",
