  "text": "During the Joseon dynasty (1392–1897), male officials wore a round-collared robe called danryeong, with hyungbae, or rank badges (examples of which are on display nearby), sewn onto the chest and back of the robe. Dyed fabrics were imported from China, so colored garments were limited to the upperclass. The collar of this robe has a paper lining to keep its shape.",
