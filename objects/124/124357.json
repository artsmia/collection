  "text": "The inspiration for this sensual nude, a favorite subject of Falguière, was the painting Phryné Before the Areopagus by the sculptor's brother-in-law Jean-Leon Gérôme. Phryné was a courtesan of Ancient Greece--her sandals and necklace represent her place in ancient history. In the painting, Phryné stands at her trial--reportedly for impropriety--while the orator Hyperedes, her defender, removes her robe to get pity on her from the jury. Falguière used both live models and photographs of them in creating his sculpture. Because of the similarity, both Gérôme and Falguière may have used the same photograph by Nadar for their models.",
