  "text": "In earlier times, samurai wore jackets and trouser suits made from richly colored and patterned silk, beneath relatively little armor. But in the 16th century the style of armor changed to cover more of the body, and these elaborate undergarments were concealed. As a result, high-ranking lords began to wear surcoats over their armor. These garments were often made of luxurious, sometimes imported materials. Flamboyant designs and glaring color choices signaled the rank and identity of the wearer and created an imposing appearance on the battlefield.",
