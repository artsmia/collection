  "text": "Lacquerware vessels were widely used for food and drink in the palaces and noble households of Han aristocracy; by the end of the Han dynasty (206 BCEâ€“220 CE) they had nearly replaced inlaid bronze and gilt vessels. They were light, durable, impervious to water, and conducive to painted decoration, like the designs of hooks, curls, and triangles on this dish.",
