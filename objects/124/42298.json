  "text": "Signed Sakura-an, literally Cherry Hermitage, this print depicts two white egrets resting amid water reeds. Although the identity of the artist is unknown, he demonstrates a clever approach to his subject. The egrets' long beaks echo the shape of the reeds and their plumage is rendered solely through embossing, suggesting how easily they are camouflaged in their natural setting. Though subtle, the artist captured the natural elegance of these egrets.",
