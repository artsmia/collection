  "text": "In a series of powerful pen and ink illustrations, New York street artist Mac McGill captures the nation's overwhelming shock and grief in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center. More than 2, 700 civilians were killed in the initial attack and subsequent collapse of the twin towers in New York City. On the same day, some 300 more died in similar attacks in Washington, D.C. and Pennsylvania. The tragic events initiated American wars in Afghanistan (2001-present) and Iraq (2003-10).",
