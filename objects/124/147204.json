  "text": "At Suminoe the waves break upon the shore\r\nEven in the night\r\nLike them will you soon draw near\r\nAlong the pathway of dreams?\r\n\r\nThe above poem is a translation of the poem that appears scattered throughout the outer cover and inside of the writing box. Rendered in writing known as chirashigaki, or scattered writing, the text enhances the movement of the roiling waves slapping the sides of the silver rocks. This work is the result of a contemporary collaboration between painted lacquer artist Mitsuishi and maki-e (lacquer decoration) artist Mitsuaki. The pair, working in the 20th-century, paid their respect to their artistic ancestor, the 17th-century lacquer artist Ogata Kōrin, by reproducing the latter's work.",
