  "text": "The warrior Taira Koremochi Ason probably lived between 1000 and 1100 CE but is only known through legends, including one in which the emperor asked him to travel to Mount Togakushi to kill a demon. In Kabuki adaptations of this story, he visits the mountain in autumn to enjoy the fall colors when he meets a beautiful woman offering him sake. Dozing off, he wakes up just in time to see her change into the demon and succeeds in killing her. Yoshitoshi captures the dramatic moment when Koremochi awakes; a strong wind adds to the tension of the situation.",
