An actual Buddhist flask similar in date and shape to the one in this sculpture is shown to the right in this same case. By this stage, Chinese sculpture had evolved a style quite different than the Indian Gupta tradition that originally inspired them. The face, with elongated eyes, silk robes, luxurious jewelry, and elaborate headdress area all Chinese characteristics.",
