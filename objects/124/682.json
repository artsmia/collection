  "text": "This gilt bronze statue of Guanyin (Avalokitesvara) shows the Bodhisattva holding a fly whisk (<I>chauri</I>) in his right hand and an ambrosia flask in his left. An actual Buddhist flask similar in date and shape to the one in this sculpture is shown to the right in this same case. By this stage, Chinese sculpture had evolved a style quite different than the Indian Gupta tradition that originally inspired them. The face, with elongated eyes, silk robes, luxurious jewelry, and elaborate headdress area all Chinese characteristics.",
