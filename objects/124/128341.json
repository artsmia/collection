  "text": "The twenty-four still-lives in this album portray delicacies of the land and sea, many commonly seen in Japanese cuisine today. Fish such as blowfish, sea bream, and sweetfish, and vegetables like pumpkin, myoga ginger, and lotus root, are, in fact, staples of the Japanese table. Fukada Chokujō, a leading member of the Shijō school of realist painting, was best known during his day for his pictures of fish and other sea life.",
