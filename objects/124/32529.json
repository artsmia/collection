  "text": "Keeping with late Song and Yuan taste for floral décor, this small tray or plate is deeply carved in the form of a blossoming lotus with a clearly defined seed pod in the center. While the outer layer is entirely black, an inner layer of red has been exposed to give clear definition to the blossom. One of the most common Buddhist symbols, the lotus stands for spiritual purity, and a small tray such as this may have been used in Buddhist rituals perhaps as an offering vessel for the altar table. Beautifully executed, this unusual design is an excellent interpretation of a natural form.",
