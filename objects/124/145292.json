  "text": "Anthony Hernandez’s 1989 photograph could be considered a portrait, though there is no body present. The cardboard that rests atop of the dry and lengthy grass approximates the shape of a human body at rest, and the depressions and wrinkles allude to the weight of those who may have rested on its surface. In photographing the objects left behind by the unhoused, Hernandez presents a clear and direct reminder of a continuing crisis.",
