  "text": "Installation artist Ann Hamilton created this set of inkjet prints by capturing still images of canaries previously recorded on video. The letters in the title—e, g, b, d, and f—refer to the notes on a musical staff and suggest the tonal range of the American Singer canary, specially bred for its free and melodious song.  Hamilton further enhanced the output by moving a burning candle across the surface of the paper, depositing soot from the burning parafin. The mysterious markings enhance the impression of the birds' fleetings movements.",
