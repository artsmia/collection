  "text": "Snowbound in the early 1930s at her New Jersey farm (bought with earnings from her children’s books), Wanda Gág headed to her studio and apparently decided to have some fun. Treating snow like hunks of sugary meringue, she carved it into patterns that might have been plucked from her childhood. The various shapes could be a frilly collar, an angel wing, or a chair leg. At middle left could be a stylized G.",
