  "text": "Amate bark cloth fabric, made in central Mexico, was the inspiration for this fabric. Its unique design and surface quality are the result of an unusual, innovative method of production, in which  an openwork pattern is screen-printed onto a rich velvet ground cloth, using an adhesive rather than a dye or printing ink. A strong Echizen handmade paper was applied to the surface and the areas not bonded by the glue were then scrubbed away with water and a brush. Due to its uneven density the cloth frequently has holes that add to the aesthetic effect of its matte surface.",
