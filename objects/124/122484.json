  "text": "Stacked trays were commonly used to store delicacies for celebrations or outings like cherry-blossom viewing. This example has three tiers of trays decorated with an allover pattern of stripes that displays an aura of modernity. Thanks to European traders who brought cloth with similar designs from Southeast Asia to Japan, stripes and checks became popular again in the late 16th and early 17th century after already being popular during the 11th century.\r\n\r\nSome of the same Nanban (lit. Souther barbarian) motifs are visible here as in the lacquer cabinet, however, they are used in a much more restrained fashion and therefore produce a completely different effect.",
