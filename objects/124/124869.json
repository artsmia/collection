  "text": "Thomsen’s painting represents a subtle compilation of experience as carried forth over a significant period of time, her structural tenacity holding her various compositions intact. She achieves this by working through a carefully articulated process involving line, space, and color, all of them essential in her ongoing commitment to quality. The resulting painting is a meticulous archive of time and process.",
