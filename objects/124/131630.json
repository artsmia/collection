  "text": "Material: Rice straw (inawara)\r\nHeavy snowfalls in winter are common in the northern part of Japan, where people needed additional protection, particularly farmers who worked outdoors. This snow hat (yuki bōshi, or yuki botchi in the regional dialect) was made of rice straw (inawara), a byproduct in rice cultivation, joined with cotton thread. Rice straw has a hollow structure, making it an excellent insulator as it wraps the wearer’s head in a layer of warmed air. Snow hats were traditionally made by men, not by trained, professional artisans. In this case, the manipulation of the materials demonstrates the artistry and skill of the maker, who employed straight stitch, tying, and braiding.",
