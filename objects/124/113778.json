Pan is typically depicted with his pan pipes, which he fashioned out of hollow reeds when the object of his affections, the wood nymph Syrinx, transformed herself into a reed to escape her unwanted suitor.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn ancient mythology, wind instruments like horns and flutes were associated with the wild and untamed, while string instruments like lutes and harps connoted civility.",
