  "text": "In 1974 Sol LeWitt produced a series of 122 painted aluminum sculptures, titled <i>Variations of Incomplete Open Cubes</i>. The different combinations of three to eleven edges, or &quot;parts, &quot; encourage the viewer to mentally construct a complete cube--for LeWitt, a symbol of three-dimensionality. Here, you see the third combination of eight parts that imply a cube.\n\nAlthough LeWitt rejected the term &quot;minimalism&quot; as demeaning to his art, his use of forms distilled to their pure geometric essences links him to the Minimalist movement. LeWitt considers himself a conceptual artist and emphasizes the process of creation, from initial idea to finished work. In his view, &quot;The idea becomes the machine that makes the art.&quot;",
