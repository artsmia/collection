  "text": "The unicorn is a mythical creature, but in the 1500s people believed it existed and thought its rarity was the reason no one had actually seen one. In this engraving a troupe of virgins (only a virgin could tame a unicorn) accompanies a unicorn in a triumphal procession. The unicorn symbolizes Jesus Christ—but with a pagan twist. God the Father, descending from heaven to witness the crowning of the unicorn by an angel, is shown as Jupiter, the supreme pagan god, accompanied by the Holy Ghost in the form of an eagle. Jean Duvet made this engraving as part of a series featuring unicorns.",
