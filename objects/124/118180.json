  "text": "Brushed carefully in clerical script, each character fills its space, anchoring itself on the paper. Read Hainei qiguan in Chinese, the text likely refers to the title of a Chinese printed illustrated book of famous sites.\r\nPublished in 1609 by Yang Erzeng, the book attracted the attention of painters and calligraphers in Japan who were interested in Chinese culture.\r\nŌkubo studied and wrote kanshi, or poetry written using Chinese characters following Chinese compositional rules. He was well-connected to scholars of Confucianism and Chinese literature and may have encountered the publication through them.\r\n海内竒觀\r\nStrange sights within the sea",
