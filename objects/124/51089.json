  "text": "Benedetto was the son of Bartolomeo Montagna (c. 1450-1523), the leading painter in the nearby city of Vicenza. While detailed drapery and landscape also appear in his father's paintings, the composition of this engraving is influenced by Venetian art, notably the work of painter Vittore Carpaccio (c. 1460-1525/26). The shading technique with elaborate cross-hatching emulates that of Albrecht Du¨rer and Giulio Campagnola.",
