  "text": "House clocks had been popular additions to wealthy homes since the 1500s, but portable pocket watches were a new and head-turning achievement in the 1700s. Their proud owners showcased them in precious watch stands when not in useâ€”the 1700s equivalent of iPhone chargers. This one exhibits a relief showing the figure of Cupid with two pierced hearts and kissing birds, suggesting that when the watch was put into its stand at night, it was time for love.",
