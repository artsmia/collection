  "text": "The 1930 Stockholm Exhibition was an important international forum for modernism, especially for <i>funkis</i>, the Swedish term for functionalism. After World War I, Swedish architects and designers had addressed the shortage of adequate housing and the push for social equality with functional buildings and decorative objects that were widely affordable.\r\n\r\nThe design of this poster, with its eye-catching colors, circular type, and uncluttered layout, allowed for easy translation into many languages. This particular poster was used to advertise the exhibition in Spain.",
