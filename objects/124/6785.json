  "text": "Still eye-catching today, this chaise is constructed of carefully bent beech wood that seems to writhe beneath the back and seat, creating motion even at a standstill. In the mid-1800s, Thonet set a precedent as the first company to make well-designed, mass-produced furniture that was widely distributed throughout Europe. But because this rocking chaise required considerable space, it was a status object for those with large and affluent homes.",
