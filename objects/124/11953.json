  "text": "“In the beginning, I didn't really have any idea that I was going to be doing rock writing images, but as a child, I used to go up to the mountains of Wyoming where there are rock writings. It felt like going into a large cathedral or a temple. And these images became something that started appearing in my work. I was working with neon, experimenting with smaller images, and suddenly I said, ‘Why don’t we try a large piece and see what happens.’ So these images have drawn me into them.” —Ernest Whiteman",
