  "text": "Using historical design motifs as inspiration for contemporary expression is an age-old practice. The 19th century designers who created this fabric were inspired by the bold, baroque designs of the 18th century. This particular velvet is made up of a central panel and two border panels. The units, designed to complement each other, were made so they could accommodate a variety of room configurations.",
