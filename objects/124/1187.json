  "text": "This illustration succinctly captures an iconic moment in the Shahnameh, when one of its great heroes, Rustam, falls asleep in a thicket of reeds. A lion attempts to attack, but Rustam’s legendary horse, Rakhsh, swiftly intercedes and kills the lion with his bare teeth. Note the pattern on Rakhsh’s body, which Rustam describes as “a wonder to behold; like saffron petals, mottled red and gold.” Bravery and loyalty are persistent themes throughout the Shahnameh, particularly in scenes with Rustam, a warrior who serves a succession of kings and is seen here on a quest to save King Kavous from a demon.",
