  "text": "Yoruba weavers and their clients in southwestern Nigeria consider hand-woven aso oke cloth to be among the most distinguished textiles. The name literally means “top cloth, ” denoting a garment of high status. This length of contemporary aso oke includes shiny metallic lurex and silk rayon threads. Additional weft thread embellishes the cloth with elephant motifs. The elephant is an important animal in Yoruba thought, associated with majesty, wisdom, and physical and spiritual power.",
