  "text": "Among the Maori, weapons were regarded as treasured heirlooms, and those made of nephrite, also called New Zealand jade, were the most precious of all. This prestigious club would have been a chiefly weapon, intended for hand-to-hand combat. The warrior would grasp it with either hand and attack the enemy with short slicing or thrusting motions. This type of club was also a status symbol, worn tucked into the belt before battle, and stored in a secret place when not in use.",
