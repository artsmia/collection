  "text": "Born and educated in ceramic design in Cork, Ireland, Flynn resides in County Cork today, concentrating on domestic-scale porcelain vessels. In the tradition of the Natzlers, she pinches and pulls her clay bodies to invite touch, while preserving their integrity as vehicles for both matte and high glazes. Her “hipped vessels” vary in size but remain a favorite form, in a variety of subtle colors.",
