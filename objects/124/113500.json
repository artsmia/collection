  "text": "The jar at Mary Magdalen's feet is for the precious ointment with which she anointed Christ. Her skirt is yellow, a color worn by prostitutes. The candle is a vanitas symbol and represents the all-seeing eye of God. There is a whip for self-mortification on the table. The chain on the floor may be jewelry she has cut off or her liberation from earthly bounds. (The Magdalen is also the patron saint of prisoners, so the chain cast off may  allude to this.) The book is open to a prayer on contrition: “Confideo Deo…” [I confess to God]. Also her hair let down is a sign of penitence.  [Alfred Moir]",
