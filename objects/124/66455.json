  "text": "This is a rare bag: Only two other examples are known to still exist. It was made by finger weaving, a technique that resembles braiding and does not require a loom. It’s one of the oldest forms of weaving, and is still used by some Native American artists. The artist strung independent threads with beads, then wove them together to create zigzagging lines and patterns. It’s not a fast process, which may be one reason so few weavers use the technique today, though it has been revived by cultural ambassadors.",
