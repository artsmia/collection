  "text": "The thatched hat and shoulder basket suggest that the man resting in the cool shade of a willow tree is a farmer who has been working in the fields. He may have stopped to take a sip of water from the gourd that hangs from his left hip. Resting his chin on the end of his hoe handle, he looks like he's dozing off while he enjoys the gentle breeze that wafts through the willow branches. Nanrei renders the branches with brushstroke-like lines that reflect his training in the Chinese literati mode of painting.",
