  "text": "This is the age-old story of the absentee father and the inexperienced teenage driver. Each day, Helios, sun-god of ancient Greece, drove his chariot across the sky from dawn until dusk. He paid little attention to his son Phaëthon. One day the boy went to Helios and asked him to demonstrate to all that he was his father. In response, Helios promised to grant Phaëthon any wish. Helios was shocked when the boy asked to drive the chariot. He warned Phaëthon that not even the mighty Jupiter could control the powerful team of horses. But Phaëthon persisted, and Helios finally gave in. Phaëthon cracked the whip, and the horses took off. Before long they careened out of control, and Jupiter had to intervene by striking Phaëthon with a thunderbolt that sent him tumbling to the earth.",
