  "text": "Clarence Carter was an important chronicler of life in Ohio, where he lived and worked much of his life. He is often called an American Scene painter but that greatly limits and confuses his range and achievement. He had a great eye for visual coincidences, was an extraordinary technician, and moved fluidly between urban industrial scenes, rural ones, portraits, and abstraction later in life. This exquisitely rendered watercolor shows what he was best at as an observer of the world. The objects are tangibly rendered and the composition is unusual, something that characterizes Carter's work. It is a sensitive and meditative image of a real place, left open-ended enough to allow for the viewer to bring their experience to the work's meaning.",
