The panel on display depicts an ancestral couple engaged in sexual intercourse, represented with characteristically bright colors and rounded forms. Themes of procreation and ancestral origins were commonly depicted in spirit houses. The two hornbills at the top of the panel relate to the spirit world and were commonly associated with ancestor figures.</span>\n</p>\n<font face=Times New Roman size=3>  </font>",
