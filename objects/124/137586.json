  "text": "Aaron Spangler’s monumental woodcut Separatist evolved from his observations of the Christian homesteaders’ sub-culture that has developed in the northern Minnesota area where he lives. Part of a larger Christian fundamentalist crusade, this cultural and ideological phenomenon developed alongside the homeschooling movement which became popular in the 1980s. The woodcut’s title alludes to the rejection of dominant secular values, culture, and education, along with all government authority, and replacing it with a radically conservative Christian ideology and lifestyle that stresses self-reliance—home birthing, homeschooling, self-healing, and farming—as well as a biblically-inspired patriarchy. It also suggests a physical separation from mainstream cultural influences, which are often associated with urban life, allowing for the pursuit of a political or religious agenda in rural America unhindered by interlopers and outsiders. Spangler’s print gathers meaning in ways similar to a shrine, a symbol-laden marker of personal and collective consciousness whose meaning may vary with the perceptions, values, and experiences of the viewer. It is part of a larger series of woodcuts he carved from large panels of basswood logged and milled in local lumber operations.",
