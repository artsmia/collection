  "text": "Multidisciplinary artist and activist Keith Haring created <i>Apocalypse</i> in collaboration with the writer William S. Burroughs to draw public attention to the ravages of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Burroughs’s Surrealist prose was a frequent source of inspiration for Haring and had a definitive impact on this series, which was published two years before the artist’s own death from HIV/AIDS. In each of these ten prints, Haring invokes a range of motifs characteristic of his visual practice: sperm and male genitalia are interspersed with bright swatches of color, Christian iconography, and even Leonardo DaVinci’s <i>Mona Lisa</i> (1503). By commingling images of the sacred and the profane, Haring unfurls an end-of-times vision for those who would turn away from the vast, tragic impacts of the epidemic.",
