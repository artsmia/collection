  "text": "Jim Denomie’s small painting packs a punch. Lively, bursting with color, and brimming with humor, it depicts Plains Indians on horseback looking out at the viewer. It is a pointed response to the romanticized and stereotyped images of Native Americans prevalent in 19th century Western American art. Denomie engaged popular culture images of Native Americans throughout his life, reclaiming and presenting them as active agents of their own destinies.",
