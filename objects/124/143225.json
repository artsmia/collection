  "text": "In the late 19th or early 20th century, Oglala Lakota artist Winyan Hcaka (The True Woman) created this exuberantly embellished parlor tablecloth or drum cover. It has been in the family of the maker for more than a century and has been worn and taken care of by four generations of Lakota women. Made from red wool trade cloth, the piece contains a stunning array of multicolored beads and design elements, all beaded in applique-style, producing a smooth and energetic surface. A “sister” piece by Winyan Hcaka is in the collection of the National Museum of the American Indian.",
