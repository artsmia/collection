  "text": "Battlefield curtains, or jinmaku, were used by feudal lords as temporary structures for meetings. They provide a private space, keep out prying eyes and at the same time give protection from wind. At some point in time, these curtains were decorated with the crest of the owner, in this case two different crests used by the Hosokawa family.",
