  "text": "One of the world's preeminent sculptors, American artist Richard Serra is best known for his monumental abstract minimalist sculptures made from iron, steel, and other industrial materials. Serra was also a celebrated printmaker. The austerity of forms, emphasis on materiality and process, and the articulation of space and surface that are hallmarks of his sculpture are also defining characteristics of his editioned prints. In this suite of intaglio prints, Serra investigates and explores the relationships between parts and the whole, inside and outside, negative and positive, light and dark, surface and background. The series of images represents a continuous topography, a sectioned whole, with abstract shapes implying motion, and forms with neither beginnings nor ends. The simple elegance, harmony, and beauty that emanates from much of Serra's work is fully expressed in this extraordinary series of etchings.",
