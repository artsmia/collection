  "text": "Buddhist priests and monks wear crowns, or diadems, like this during certain religious ceremonies, especially priestly initiation rites. One of the Five Cosmic Buddhas decorates each panel, which are arranged as on a mandala, or cosmic diagram. On the far left, Amoghasiddhi (green) represents north, and on the far right, Ratnasabhava (yellow) represents south. Vairochana, the white deity and principal cosmic buddha, presides over the center with a gesture of exposition. When crowned and seated in the proper direction, the priest creates and enters a living mandala.",
