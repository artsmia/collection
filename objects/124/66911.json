  "text": "This bold and colorful banana plant is one of Merian's most famous illustrations. Bananas were introduced to the Caribbean in the early sixteenth century and from there spread to other parts of South America. As few Europeans would have tasted these seedless fruits, she described them in detail in Metamorphosis Insectorum Surinamensium: It is used like an apple, and has a pleasant flavor like apples…it is good cooked and raw. When unripe they are green, while the ripe fruit is lemon yellow inside and out; they have a thick skin like a lemon.",
