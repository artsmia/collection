  "text": "Takemura Yūri’s father’s work as a graphic designer sparked her interest in the arts. Initially drawn to painting, she discovered that ceramics were a better fit for her, since it did not limit her to a two-dimensional surface. Her main interest is in tea bowls, whose sensuous forms she embellishes with glossy, metallic sections and contrasting patches of deep color.",
