  "text": "Takemura Yūri took her inspiration for this bowl from an ancient myth about a struggle between two brothers, a fisherman called Umisachi (literally, “goes to the sea”) and a hunter called Yamasachi (“goes to the mountains”). Takemura reimagines this struggle between land and sea in the swirling, organic surface decoration of her bowl.",
