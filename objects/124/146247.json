  "text": "Inside a dark room, a mother kneels before a smoky warm fire to cook a meal for her family. Two small children, along with their tired father and lively cat, watch intently, their hunger is palpable in their quiet, fixed gazes on a large, golden pancake. Jozef Israëls, one of the most celebrated Dutch artists of the 19th century, excelled in depicting such intimate interior scenes, particularly mealtimes and moments of rest of fishermen and the rural poor. His dark, tonal manner and broad brushwork are indebted to Rembrandt, the great Dutch master active two centuries earlier, but Israëls incorporated aspects of  contemporary French realist painters. He embellished the description of his subjects' tattered cloths and weathered complexions, and magnified the scale of the genre scene, so that the picture is immersive for the viewer and the scene seems to be unfolding before us.",
