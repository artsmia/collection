  "text": "Keri Ataumbi and Jamie Okuma worked collaboratively to bring fellow Native American woman Pocohantas to life. Drawing inspiration from 1616 engravings by Simon van de Passe, and Thomas Sully’s classic 1852 portrait of Pocohantas, Okuma created portraits on buckskin that were then adorned by Ataumbi’s use of precious metals and stones. This beautiful set strengthens the MIA’s collection in many ways, from modern design to traditional Native beadwork.",
