  "text": "In this print Dürer combines Nemesis, the classical goddess of retribution, whose goblet and bridle represent favor and castigation, with the traditional winged figure of Fortune standing on a globe.  The landscape beneath the figure has been identified as a view of the South Tyrolean town on Chiusa (or Klausen), which Dürer presumably drew during his first journey to Venice in 1494-95. In his landscape, Dürer combines both a panoramic vastness and an amazing amount of identifiable detail. It looks remarkably like a view a modern traveler has from an airplane.",
