  "text": "Egmont Arens began his career as an industrial designer. Little, however, is known about his fellow collaborator, Theodore Brookhart. During the 1930s Arens wrote influential articles about appetite appeal for package design. His penchant for the streamline is clearly evident in this muscular meat slicer now regarded as an enviable addition to any serious collection of American industrial design.",
