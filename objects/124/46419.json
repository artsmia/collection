  "text": "Finally, in the Whirlwind of the mystical ecstasy, the true God is manifest. He is Jesus, the Divine Imagination, and the Forgiveness of Sins: the only God whom Blake recognized. He is in a cruciform position and his right foot is forward. He descends below the cloud-barriers which normally separate the worlds. Job and his wife behold God with serene joy. To the right, Job's friends cannot see God because the blast blows them flat like the Forest of Error in the margin below. Job's pride is crushed at last; his life is made straight; his faith is confirmed.\r\n\r\nIn the upper margin continues the circular motion of the Whirlwind. The figures are the six Eyes in their rotation; inevitably they have reached the seventh, who is Jesus, whose likeness is that of Job.",
