  "text": "Among the quieter revelations in L'Estampe originale was this experimental relief print, which mimics in paper what sculptor Alexandre Charpentier had been doing in his portrait medallions. The modest subject-lost in her playing, hair not quite in place-seems to punctuate the paper with each attack of her bow. The print also heralds Charpentier's pioneering contributions to Art Nouveau, evident in the embossed floral backdrop. He used a separate intaglio plate, uninked, to emboss the underlying design.",
