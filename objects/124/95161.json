Its minimalist design allowed American children to rethink the horse-and-rider scenario and instead become a World War I fighter pilot or an astronaut flying to the moon. Creative Playthings still makes educational, simple, and abstracted modern toys for children, primarily out of wood, just as they did during the 1950s and 1960s.",
