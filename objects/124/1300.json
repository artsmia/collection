  "text": "The American eagle on this plate was copied from a Massachusetts copper cent of 1787-88, although the sunburst was not added until the 2 1/2 dollar gold coin was issued in 1796. This design was the most popular version of the American eagle on export porcelain for the American market during the three decades that eagles were in vogue, about 1790-1820.",
