  "text": "The <I>ji</I> halberd is a combination of a dagger-ax and a spear. Discovered in North Vietnam, this outstanding example is twice as long as the few other recorded examples in western collections. Its blade is elegantly curved and each side of the object is decorated with a tiny spiral pattern. It is perforated and flanged in a manner that allows a wooden handle to be lashed to it.\r\n\r\n<P>The surface displays a patina that develops when bronze objects are buried over extended periods in water or mud. Smaller weapons with this patina have been excavated from coastal burial sites of northern Vietnam and are usually associated with the Dong Son culture of the 8th through 2nd century BCE. This halberd appears to be one of the largest and amongst the best preserved objects known of this type.",
