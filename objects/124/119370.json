  "text": "Wisps of sweeping vibrant colors intermix and radiate from the center toward the paper’s edge. Alex Janvier (Cold Lake First Nations) creates active shapes and lines that pulsate bold hues and gentle lines, creating complex relationships between color and design. Janvier draws inspiration from many places, including beading and birchbark from his Native community to Modern masters like Wassily Kandinsky and Paul Klee. Abstraction and representation are fundamental for Janvier. Equally informed by the vocabulary found in his fine arts training and those associated with the activities and symbols found in the art of his Native community.",
