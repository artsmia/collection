  "text": "Torii Kiyotada IV was the 7th generation head of the Torii school of artists that had emerged in the late 17th century in Edo (today Tokyo) and played a crucial role in the development of Japanese ukiyo-e art, particularly in the field of theater-related imagery. Kiyotada IV was active during a time when traditional kabuki began to change because contemporary events were now allowed to be addressed on stage, which was forbidden during the previous Edo period (1603–1868). This unusually large painting is not theater related but of a samurai warrior mounted on a rearing black horse riding towards the battlefield.",
