  "text": "Completed in 1971, this untitled acrylic painting on paper is characteristic of Herbert Ferber’s mature painting style, which commonly features interlocking geometric forms that display an inner tension or force. Perhaps not surprisingly, Ferber’s paintings share many of the formal characteristics found among his abstract sculptures. Here, Ferber depicts what is essentially a fully-realized sculpture set within an indeterminate space. Composed of various trapezoids, spheres (some hollowed), and linear shapes in yellow, dark blue, and white, the colored sculptural elements are made visually prominent when set against a brilliant orange background. The work’s spatial tension is further accentuated by the contrasting colors of the various interlocking elements.",
