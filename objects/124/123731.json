  "text": "This print by the twentieth-century print designer Takahashi Hiroaki (Shōtei) depicts a man leading a packhorse along a path near rice fields. Tall pine trees frame a view of Japan’s iconic Mount Fuji across a marshy area known as “Fujinuma” (literally, “the marshes of Fuji”) located near the coast south of the mountain. Views of Mount Fuji from this area were already depicted in mid-nineteenth century woodblock prints, for example by Utagawa Hiroshige. Shōtei was the first artist to design prints showing famous sites or views of Japan for the major publisher Watanabe Shōzaburō that were sold as relatively inexpensive souvenirs to foreign travelers.",
