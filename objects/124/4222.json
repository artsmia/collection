  "text": "Yorubaland in Nigeria is divided into a dozen kingdoms, one of which is Owo. The Olowo (king) or Owo would wear this headdress along with a matching jacket and skirt as his ceremonial costume. The outfit relates to the chief's military duties, and is also worn by select officials with impressive military records. The ivory feathers on either side, however, distinguish this headdress as belonging to the ruler.\r\n\r\nMade of red wool flannel and decorated with yellow and green embroidery and white glass beads, the design is meant to create the impression of the scales of a pangolin. This armored anteater is a powerful symbol of invincibility.",
