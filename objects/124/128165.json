  "text": "Miquel Aragón addresses the brutality of drug-related violence in his native Mexico by altering published photographs and digital images of murder victims to explore ideas such as perception, memory, and transformation. Using reductive printmaking techniques that include cutting, drilling, and erasure, he converts these bloody scenes of decapitations, shootings, and assault into dramatic new images that paradoxically exhibit certain aesthetic qualities. As in this portrait of a drug-war murder victim, Aragón’s images function as visual metaphors that generate new meanings and associations, including reminders that our lives are finite.",
