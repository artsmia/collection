  "text": "There’s a good reason why a Yoruba crown is always placed on the ruler’s head from behind or from the side: grave disaster could strike if the king sees inside the conical headdress, so potent is its power. For similar reasons, his subjects shouldn’t gaze upon his face, usually covered by a beaded veil to prevent such encounters. This crown is also adorned with royal birds, regarded as important messengers between the divine world and the earth.",
