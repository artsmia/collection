  "text": "This vibrant handscroll captures a grand wedding procession in Qing dynasty China. With over eighty meticulously detailed figures, the painting illustrates a highly choreographed parade of musicians, standard bearers, lantern carriers, and attendants. At the heart of the procession are two ornate sedan chairs, one revealing the bride's face through a small window. Such images celebrated social rituals and conveyed the prestige of the families involved. The banners and “double happiness” symbols express joy and auspicious wishes. Rich in ceremonial detail, this painting reflects Confucian ideals of order and filial propriety. It provides rare visual insight into Qing matrimonial customs and enhances the museum’s collection of Chinese genre painting and social documentation.",
