  "text": "This exquisite manuscript page typifies the artistic and technical virtuosity accorded illuminated books during the Mamluk period (1250-1517). By the 13th century, more cursive writing styles had replaced kufic as the preferred Koranic script. The main body of the text is written in a cursive style commonly called <I>muhaqqaq</I> script, characterized by tall, slender verticals and sweeping sublinear strokes. The chapter heading, framed in gold and vegetal ornamentation, is in <I>thuluth</I> script.\r\n\r\nSultans and amirs commissioned mostly large Korans for the specific mosques and religious foundations they endowed. Multi-volume Korans were popular during the Mamluk period, when standard formats included large single volumes, double volumes, and smaller thirty-volume sets. The scribe, or calligrapher, enjoyed the greatest prestige among the several Muslim artists responsible for producing books.",
