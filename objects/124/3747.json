  "text": "A founder of the Wiener Werkstätte (Vienna Workshops) with Josef Hoffmann in 1903, Koloman Moser began his career as a painter working with the Vienna Secession artists in the Viennese Art Nouveau style of the 1890s. His early Secession designs are characterized by naturalistic motifs on a grid-pattern. His later work for the Wiener Werkstätte included graphic design, metalwork, ceramics, leatherwork and glass and incorporated more abstract and geometric decoration, also using a grid pattern. In this pitcher Moser has removed all decoration and employed the crackle pattern of the glass as the sole ornament on the simple geometric form.",
