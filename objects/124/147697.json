  "text": "The naginata is a halberd-like pole weapon comparable to the European glaive or fauchard. It has a single-edged blade in the size and shape of a sword that is mounted on the end of a wooden pole. In the 12th century, the naginata was regarded as a very effective weapon used by samurai on the battle field against cavalry. In the peaceful Edo period (1603–1868), the naginata became the iconic weapon for women and its study was a must for all women born into a samurai family.",
