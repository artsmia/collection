  "text": "In 1937, Luís Arenal cofounded the Taller de Gráfica Popular (People’s Graphics Workshop) in Mexico City, one of the most important printmaking collectives in Latin America. Together its members sought to raise awareness of national issues. In addition to posters and broadsheets, the TGP produced images devoted to native Mexican life, such as Arenal’s expressively sober portrait of this woman from the province of Taxco. He called her “a symbol of my country and its inner strength.”",
