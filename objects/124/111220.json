  "text": "This Netherlandish drinking glass of the type called <I>Berkemeyer</I> is notable for its flared bowl, which tapers to a hollow stem decorated with textured prunts. Both a decorative element and a practical one, the applied prunts were originally designed to provide drinkers in any state of sobriety, or lack thereof, with a good grip. The name <I>Berkemeyer</I> is reminiscent of the fact that the glass type was based upon wooden drinking vessels, which were frequently carved of birch wood, or <I>berkemei</I> in Dutch. The distinctive prunts became iconic in the decoration of Netherlandish and German drinking glasses in the Renaissance and Baroque periods. As a result, Berkemeyers are often depicted in Netherlandish still life paintings of the 17th and 18th centuries.",
