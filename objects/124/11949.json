  "text": "Small, portable prehistoric female figurines dating to the time period known as the Paleolithic Age have been found across Europe. This figure’s small size and lack of a base suggest that it was a ritual object and may have been regarded as possessing magical power. Given the importance of survival through reproduction and securing a food supply in the Paleolithic Age, this figure may have represented female fertility and the ability to bear children.\r\n\r\nThese figures were until recently referred to as “Venus” figures. The name has now been reconsidered by historians, reflecting the fact that such figures were created centuries before stories of the goddess Venus were presented in Roman mythology. These statuettes are now simply considered female figures.",
