  "text": "Numerous geometric shapes pile up upon one another, overlapping and superimposed on a teal ground. Circles, squares, rectangles, and other shapes of various sizes appear to lay upon one another as if they are cut pieces of colored paper. The artist, Paul Kelpe, was dedicated to expanding the language of abstract art as a painter, collagist and in making objects. Because his work often gave the illusion of space some of his fellow artists felt he was not abstract enough. Kelpe rejected this and continued to think through new ways to design pictures that gave a sense of dynamic movement and excited vision.",
