  "text": "Tribes that live in the northern section of the Northwest Coast are known for their highly refined sculpture.  Characterized by low-relief carving, these northern tribes, which include the Tlingit, often feature clan symbols as their subjects. The bear is a central theme in Tlingit art, and is considered a close relative to humans.  Because of this, bears are believed to have special spiritual powers and are, therefore, worthy of respect.   \r\n\r\nThough a small, utilitarian object, this pin brilliantly represents the style and iconography of Northwest Coast tribal traditions. Shallowly carved in abstracted, geometric forms, the sacred bear is shown holding a fish. In addition to the fastidious carving, the artist further embellished the pin by inlaying a piece of mother-of-pearl for the bear's eye. This pin would have been used to fasten a textile that was draped over the shoulders and around the torso. Worn on the chest, the image of the bear would have been proudly displayed.",
