  "text": "Born in Leiden, Jan Steen spent much of his career there, but he painted &quot;Lazarus and the Rich Man&quot; during a ten-year stint in Haarlem. The parable of Lazarus, a poor beggar, and the rich man, appears in the Christian Bible, in the Gospel of Luke. A rich man (&quot;dives&quot; in Latin) lived luxuriously in his grand house filled with fine feasts and clothes, while Lazarus, a poor man, begging outside is left hungry and ill. Steen represents a maid shaking the crumbs from the tablecloth of the rich man's table onto Lazarus below, as dogs lick his wounds. After their deaths, the rich man suffered the torments of Hades, while angels carried Lazarus to the bosom of Abraham. The rich man pleaded with Abraham to send Lazarus to serve and comfort him, but Abraham said it was impossible. He told the rich man that an uncrossable gulf had opened between the two men. This lesson was apt for Holland’s elite, some of whom grew wealthy through colonialism and the slave trade, as we are reminded by the Black youth at left —near the column—who observes the hedonistic party.",
