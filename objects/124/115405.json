  "text": "In 1995, Inoue Manji was recognized in Japan as a Living National Treasure for his work in white porcelain. Inoue was born and raised in Arita, a city famous for its colorful pottery.  At the age of 30, he was a technical researcher in the district kiln-testing facility, which helped him gain an appreciation for the difficulty of working with porcelain.\r\nInoue went on to become a ceramics artist and has built his reputation on his unembellished white wares, each one finished with a flawless transparent glaze.",
