  "text": "Todd Norsten’s text-based screenprint JFK in “64” presents a jarring image for those who know the history of President John F. Kennedy’s assassination on November 22, 1963. Designed to resemble a political campaign sign of the period, the starkly graphic print speaks to what might have been if the president had not met his fate on a crisp fall afternoon in Dallas, Texas.",
