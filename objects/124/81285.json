  "text": "This intricately wrinkled and textured <I>ying</I> stone is a classic example of a distant view mountain rock. Deep crevices traverse the rock's middle giving it the impression of several mountain peaks separated by gorges. The white calcite inclusion approximates the look of a mountain glacier. Miniature mountain landscapes form a sub-category of scholar's rocks. More reflective of the natural environment than the dramatically convoluted and perforated <I>ling-pi</I> and <I>tai-hu</I> scholar's rocks, they were perfect for studios that lacked views of a distant landscape.",
