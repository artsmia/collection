  "text": "Comprising two distinct elements—an upright slab roughly incised with spontaneous strokes and a sheet-like form draped over it—this striking piece reimagines the ancient henko (flat stoneware pot). While retaining the characteristic flatness of its prototype, its austere reddish-gray surface recalls the texture and tonality of stoneware from the fifth to fourteenth centuries. In a decisive break from ceramic tradition, however, Kōyama Yasuhisa abandoned functionality in favor of sculptural abstraction, transforming the vessel into a thoroughly modern expression of form and material.",
