  "text": "The three large figures at the top of the scroll are portraits of the religious leaders of Pure Land Buddhism (Jōdo Shin): Hōnen, Shinran, and the lesser-known Myōkyō. The scroll illustrates the primary lineage of the school, with the sect’s adherents seated at the very bottom of the picture. The bottom right figure, wearing a robe decorated with a family crest, likely represents the man who commissioned the painting.",
