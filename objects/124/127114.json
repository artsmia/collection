  "text": "In a handful of southern Moroccan villages, women embellish their black scarves by embroidering them with dazzling bright-orange designs. Common motif elements such as small circles and spirals, leaves, and flowers are used to create vibrant compositions that reflect the wearer’s personality. These large garments cover the head, shoulders, and upper body and may also be used to wrap a baby or child.",
