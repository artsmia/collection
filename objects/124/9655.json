  "text": "This rather unusual fan print design is by Hiroshige II who often closely followed the style and designs of his immensely successful mentor. This print, however, reflects Hiroshige II's own unique approach. It shows the artist's close observation of a house cat which he depicted a bold and minimal manner. With hind legs braced against the ground, the cat appears ready to pounce.",
