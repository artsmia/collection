Here, the artist represents Capuchin monks, one of whom is either writing or sketching, in an a huge, dusky archway which opens to brightly lit ancient Roman ruins. The setting may be Tivoli--a picturesque and popular site, not far from Rome, where contemporary landscape painters found an endless variety of evocative vistas.",
