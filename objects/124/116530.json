  "text": "Robert Mapplethorpe was one of the most famous photographers of the late 20th century. Though perhaps best known for his shocking, sexually-charged images, he had an exquisite sensibility for the beautiful. Near the end of his life, he entered into collaboration with Steve Anderson of Vermillion Editions Limited. Mapplethorpe supplied the present photographs to Anderson who used them as the basis for a photolithographic diptych published by Vermillion in 1988.",
