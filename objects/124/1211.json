  "text": "This striking text from chapter six of the Koran was written in <I>maghribi</I>, a western Islam form of <I>kufic</I> script. In the ninth century, the Aghlahids broke from the Abbasid caliphate in Baghdad and established their own dynasty in Kairovan (present-day Tunisia). They were great patrons of the arts who, along with their successors, the Fatimids, were instrumental in developing western Islamic calligraphy throughout North Africa and Spain. The distinguishing feature of <I>maghribi</I> is the modification of rectangular <I>kufic</I> forms into cursive ones, with definite curves and almost perfect semicircles that are most evident in the flourishes in the final forms of certain letters.",
