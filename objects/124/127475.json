  "text": "Jiang Tiefeng is one of the founding members of the Yunnan School of Painting, known for the creation of “heavy-color painting.” Jiang’s works almost seem like stained glass windows, with a typical composition including women, horses, birds, and flowers with brightly colored ink and calligraphic lines. Characteristic of the style, this print features bright, bold colors with intense linear elements, depicting a reclining female figure in a bed of blossoming flowers. The Yunnan school influenced many younger artists to explore styles different from traditional Chinese visual culture, encouraging artists to paint from their own experience.",
