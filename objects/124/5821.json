Mixing levity and discord, biology and social commentary, he has created fanciful and entertaining sculptural installations.  Most of his works have been generated as public art projects.  This drawing is a preparatory sketch for a sculpture which is part of the Life Underground series of 30 bronzes installed at the subway station at 8th Avenue and 14th Street in Manhattan.",
