It reads: 'In the 2nd month, 1st decade, on the day Ting-mao Lady Kung Ki ordered Chao to have the management of the fields; Chao had his merits reviewed [?] and was given a horse and was given a fur coat. in response he extolled Kung Ki's grace and so made this precious vessel.' This is a well known inscription found on one 'Tsun' and one 'Yu, ' but it is of early Chou time and (No Yu existed in Middle Chou or Haui) is much too archaic for this Huai style vessel. the inscription only is a forgery. the vessel is a Huai style specimen of the highest class and is beyond suspicion or reproach.",
