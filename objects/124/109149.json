  "text": "Using makeup, costumes, painting, and sometimes digital manipulation, Morimura Yasumasa has explored the intersection of art and identity by impersonating portraits of famous individuals from art history. He’s posed as Vincent van Gogh, Marilyn Monroe, the Mona Lisa, and, in this case, Frida Kahlo, the Mexican artist known for her lush, surreal self-portraits. Morimura, who calls himself a cross between an actor and a visual artist, says of the work, “The various elements of . . . Frida and myself mix into a muddle and a chemical reaction occurs, creating this imaginary Frida of mine.” Kahlo’s Mexican shawl has become a stylish Louis Vuitton wrap, and instead of fresh flowers Morimura wears a tiara of artificial blossoms.",
