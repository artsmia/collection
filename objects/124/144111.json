  "text": "A triumphant image of Jesus is at the center of this painting, newly emerged from the tomb in resurrection. Its remnants are to be seen on the left side. Behind him is the damaged fragment of a wooden crucifix. Light bounces in fractals all around him. In the foreground a man plays a saxophone and just behind him, a woman, perhaps dancing in a reverie, bends and gestures with her hand. Reinhardt's mysterious modern vision of Jesus as the light of the world seems to connect creativity with divine inspiration.",
