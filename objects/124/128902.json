  "text": "Judy Pfaff is a contemporary artist with a wide-ranging practice that includes installations (sometime on an enormous scale), sculpture, painting, and printmaking. Year of the Rat is a multipart wall installation, including 10 mix-media drawings in patinated frames that are intended to hang in front of wallpaper also designed by the artist. In its totality, the work delves into many themes that her polymathic mind has explored throughout her long, productive career: botany, cosmography, seriality, spirituality, geometry, aging, etc. It combines nature studies with dense patterning on a large scale that create an immersive environment for the viewer. We get caught up in the detail of plants, patterns based on algorithms, reflections of the sky or industrial scrap—so much based on rules that it could be machine made but emphatically crafted by hand.",
