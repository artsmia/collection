  "text": "The cool, luminous tones of celadon have long fascinated Asian potters and their patrons. Many artists look back to the perfection achieved by potters during China's Sung dynasty and attempt to emulate the smooth surfaces and chaste forms of their wares. Yoshikawa, however, creates fantastical architectural forms with abrupt angles and sharp edges. The tall, unbroken surfaces of these porcelain towers, nevertheless, provide an ample backdrop to the translucent blue-green glaze.",
