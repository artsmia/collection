  "text": "Eva Gonzales was Edouard Manet's only formal student and modeled frequently for several members of the Impressionist group. A plethora of Self-Portraits executed in Manet’s manner were soon followed by images of domestic life and still life studies in her own more personal style.  She married the graphic artist Henri Guérard in 1879 but died shortly thereafter in childbirth.",
