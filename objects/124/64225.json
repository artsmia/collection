  "text": "Wakasa Bay, along the west coast of central Japan, has long been known as a prime spot for flatfish. Fishermen used nets to catch the fish, which live near the ocean floor. Here Hiroshige shows a group of fishermen in a large sail boat pulling up their nets. While some are firmly holding the edges of the net, others are busy keeping the sail in place so that the boat moves in the right direction. Hiroshige's inclusion of these details contributes to the scene's vividness and verisimilitude. As the net emerges, flatfish as well as some crabs appear on the surface of the water conveying the auspicious impression of a bountiful catch.",
