Pichon began to develop his own clientele in the 1830s and by the 1840s, was exhibiting portraits regularly at the Salon. In this three-quarters-length portrait from 1844, richly painted textiles, a Gothic-revival chair rail, and the sitter’s elegant coiffure and gown reflect contemporary taste and social sophistication. Later in his career, Pichon received religious commissions for churches in Paris, including Saint-Sulpice, Saint-Eustache, Saint-Séverin and secular commissions for prominent buildings including the Hôtel de Ville and the Palais Luxembourg. Honored with the Legion of Honor in 1861, Pichon remained active in Paris until his death in 1900.</span></b>",
