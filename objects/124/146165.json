  "text": "Filled with blazing shades of hand dyed cochineal yarn, master weaver Marilou Schultz draws upon an almost extinct woven technique to reaffirm the vitality of Navajo weaving today. Cultural Flames, a part of a series of work that references Navajo sacred elements (fire, water, wind, earth), bursts with energy and movement, achieved through zig-zag designs and a wedge weave technique. Established in the mid 19th Century, Navajo weavers paired this technique with brilliant yarn from Germantown, Pennsylvania in order to push the medium in content, design and form. Wedge weaves are created by radically shifting the warp strings back and forth, a labor intensive and highly specialized process only a handful of Navajo weavers still utilize.",
