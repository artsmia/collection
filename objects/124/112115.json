  "text": "Bill Kelly is a noted contemporary American painter, printmaker, and sculptor. Kelly's graphic work is generally abstract, with a strong lyricism that is inspired by nature and natural forms. For the Traces project, he produced a series of brilliant double-page intaglio prints with overlays of hand-applied pochoir (stencils).  A rich blend of texture, color, and tone dominates the page and engulfs the reader's field of vision. The book also features an equal number of Peter Everwine's evocative prose poems, brief narratives of personal loss and remembrance set as letterpress and printed directly on Kelly's images.",
