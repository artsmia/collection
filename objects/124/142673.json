  "text": "Frank Walter’s giddy car careening along a palm tree-lined roadway distills the artist’s surrealist approach to the everyday, making even a clumsy, late-model vehicle seem an agent of speed and mystery.  Like a vignette within a larger narrative, this diminutive tondo—the term for such circular works of art—captures a moment of action and suspense, suggestive of a chase scene.  The viewer peers into the limits of Walter’s composition only to wonder (and perhaps worry) about the story just beyond view.",
