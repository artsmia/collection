  "text": "Printmaker, painter, and sculptor Georg Baselitz is one of Germany’s most celebrated artists, a leader of the Neo-expressionist movement. In 1969, he began showing his subjects upside down to stress the artifice of his work rather than its representational content, a practice he continues.\r\n\r\nIf you stand on your head, Pferd shows a horse grazing in a field, perhaps early or late in the day when the shadows are long. But what Baselitz really wants you to see is the vibrant action of his hand. Powerful, searching, free strokes that quiver and slash, breaking up form just as quickly as they define it. He adds to the chaos by applying color only loosely attached to delineated form.",
