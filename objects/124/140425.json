  "text": "This artwork is part of the series COVID-19: Labor Camp Report.   \r\n\r\nArtist's statement on this artwork originally published on the @laborcamp Instagram account: \r\n\r\n<i>As a country we have lost nearly a quarter million lives. Yet, because the Regime desperately tries to evade responsibility for this enormous loss, we are still denied the opportunity to collectively grieve. Even more disturbingly, the individual grief of families, friends and loved ones of those who perished to the pandemic, is systematically marginalized and insulted by the constant denials of the scale and pervasiveness of this catastrophe. The illusion of normalcy we are being fed is insulting, and only serves to multiply the pain.</i>",
