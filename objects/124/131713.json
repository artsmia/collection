  "text": "Material and technique: Felted wool and stencil-resist dye (katazome)\r\nFelt rugs, or mōsen, were mostly used to achieve warmth and comfort during the winter. Businesses, teahouses, and homes laid them over the traditional tatami (rice straw mats) flooring. Wool felt was imported from China or Mongolia, where such rugs were used as flooring within yurts, the portable tent dwellings of nomadic herders. This example features an elaborate lattice pattern across the entire surface, dyed with a stencil resist (katazome). Between the latticework are stylized persimmon flowers.",
