  "text": "One of Mexico's bet known graphic artists, Toledo moved to Paris at the age of 20, where he lived for five years while working at Atelier 17. This invaluable experience confirmed Toledo's growing interest in printmaking-its centuries-old traditions, its wide-ranging techniques, and its limitless potential for expression.\r\n\r\nEclectic in style and subject, Toledo's work ranges from dream-like tales inspired by indigenous Mexican mythology to distinctly modern responses to nature and personal experiences. His art is often described as visualizations of the fantastic real, bizarre themes of the human imagination, or of poetry that lies outside the laws of nature. As seen in this mixed intaglio print, his works typically feature real or mythical animals, often in consort with humans, or anthropomorphized animals that carry the attributes of men and women. His characters, whether human or animal, often wear masks to hide or alter their true identity.",
