  "text": "Akiyama Yō has never been interested in making traditional vases, plates, or tea bowls. Instead he has devoted himself to fashioning works that reveal the inherent nature of the clay itself. He creates the uniquely cupped and cracked surfaces of his pieces by applying a blowtorch to the still damp clay. This is one of his largest work from the series Peneplain which is a geological term for land formations that are more or less flat through erosion.",
