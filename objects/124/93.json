  "text": "The god Osiris of ancient Egyptian mythology is described as the King of the Underworld, responsible for judging the dead and welcoming those deemed righteous into the afterlife. He became a powerful symbol of death, resurrection, and immortality. His power and divinity are represented by his funeral wrappings for mummification—a process reserved for pharaohs and the higher classes—and his crook and flail, which symbolized pharaonic authority. Ancient Egyptians would place symbols of Osiris on coffins and say prayers in his name for the dead, hoping to earn protection for the deceased in the afterlife.",
