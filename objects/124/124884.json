  "text": "Ernest Duez represented a class of French painters at the end of the nineteenth century who merged the differing styles of the conservative Salon tradition and the progressive modernist painters. The influence of Edouard Manet, whom Duez admired and collected, is most evident in this richly impasted <I>Still-Life</I>. When Duez painted this <I>Still-Life</I> in 1883 his studio was near that of John Singer Sargent, with whom he became a close friend.",
