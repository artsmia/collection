  "text": "This futonji, composed of six rectangular cotton panels, features a deep blue ground dyed with indigo and embellished with various shibori techniques. Among the motifs are a repeating vertical pattern of tatewaku (rising steam) and tsubo-tsubo (literally pot pot). The tatewaku design, depicted as undulating vertical lines, employs kanoko shibori (or fawn-spot shibori), where small gathers were bound and knotted to create reserved spots against the dyed backdrop. The tsubo-tsubo motif, portraying a large circle with a smaller semi-circle resembling a lid, utilizes bōshi shibori (or capped shibori).",
