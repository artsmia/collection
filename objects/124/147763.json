  "text": "This elegant earthenware figure portrays a Tang dynasty court lady standing with hands gently clasped in front. Her high-waisted gown cascades in soft folds, and her twin-bun hairstyle reflects the height of Tang fashion. Faint traces of pigment suggest the figure was once vividly painted, enhancing its lifelike charm. Tomb figures like this one reflect the grandeur and cosmopolitan spirit of Tang society. More than decorative, they served to accompany and comfort the deceased in the afterlife. Embodying ideals of grace, beauty, and refinement, the figure captures the Tang fascination with performance, elegance, and social ritual. Her poised bearing offers a timeless vision of feminine decorum shaped by one of China’s most dynamic and worldly dynasties.",
