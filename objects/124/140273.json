  "text": "This artwork is part of the series COVID-19: Labor Camp Report.   \r\n\r\nArtist's statement on this artwork originally published on the @laborcamp Instagram account: \r\n\r\n<i>As governments everywhere lift the “shelter-in-place” measures, I am experiencing a deepened sense of insecurity. My home at first seemed to be a safe space, then it felt vulnerable to encroaching ignorance, and now I feel even less protected than when the quarantine was put in place weeks ago. It’s so disappointing to see the positive impact of physical distancing be squandered for the benefit of “economy” which simply means: profit for the ruling class.</i>",
