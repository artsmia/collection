  "text": "Ruunpe are the most intricate and colorful of Ainu robes. Ainu women rendered Japanese trade cotton, as well as recycled silk textiles, into large, multicolored appliquéd designs. A close look reveals the sophisticated, intentional, and painstaking approach Ainu women brought to their work. In some examples, it is clear they viewed patterned cloth as an opportunity to add a vibrant design dimension, juxtaposing or interlayering it with embroidered lines and solid colors.",
