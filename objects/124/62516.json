The phrase alludes to the fast pace of life, especially in 1920s New York, as does the scale’s shape—a commanding skyscraper. Two chrome hooks on the sides hold a user’s belongings, ensuring a more accurate weight reading. The person’s weight and fortune are printed out on a ticket, for the cost of a penny.",
