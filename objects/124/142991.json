  "text": "This modest drawing represented a key step in Charles Biederman's embrace of abstraction and the possibilities it opened up in his practice. He worked out new ideas in form through drawing and collage and transferred these ideas into paintings and sculpture. Working on paper allowed him to play, take risks, and see where these quick ideas might point.",
