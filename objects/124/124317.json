  "text": "The legendary strongman Hercules was born to the god Zeus and a mortal named Alcmena. This union so incensed Zeus’s wife Hera that she made life almost unbearable for the hero. Her ire resulted in him undertaking a series of tasks, known as the Twelve Labors of Hercules. Sebald Beham challenged his audience’s knowledge of the classical text, engraving three actual labors and nine scenes of Hercules’ exploits before and after his labors.\r\n\r\nIn the final labor, the hero must secure three-headed Cerberus, guard dog of the Underworld. Pluto, god of the Underworld, agreed to let Hercules take Cerberus if he could subdue him with his bare hands.",
