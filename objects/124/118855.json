  "text": "Internationally known as a leading proponent of the geodesic dome, Buckminster Fuller was a prominent theorist in architectural systemics, a methodology and discipline that explores structural design based on repeatable geometric elements. Though appreciated more as a designer than an artist, Fuller created complex sculptural objects and abstract designs as part of his life-long experiments in structural innovation and the applications of new materials in architecture. Duo-tet Star Polyhedra is one of several editioned multiples Fuller produced in the early 1980s that explore and present his theories of structural design. Elegant in design and execution, the three-dimensional structure functions both as a work of art and as a model of the mathematical and geometric properties underlying its construction. In this respect, Fuller used various contrasting colors and materials to accentuate the internal geometric relationships of his polyhedra sculpture while lending the work an engaging physical presence.",
