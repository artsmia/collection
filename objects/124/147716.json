  "text": "David L. Parker’s long career as a physician provided him with an opportunity to visit with patients afflicted by Hansen’s disease (known as leprosy), a bacterial infection that when left untreated could lead to scarring of the skin and nerve damage. Parker has been conducting research on Hansen’s since 1993, and as part of this work, has also been photographing patients with the goal of drawing attention to the need for earlier detection and treatment. Here, he presents a patient at the Anandaban Hospital, considered by some a refuge for those recovering from Hansen’s who are often stigmatized for their condition.",
