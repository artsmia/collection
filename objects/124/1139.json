  "text": "Generally speaking, the individual bells cast for graduated sets will typically display the same decoration regardless of size. The set of which this relatively small <I>bo</I> was part must have been quite striking. It has a simple yet elegant suspension device: a plain loop carried on the heads of two tigers. The circular bosses (raised partial spheres) are coiled snakes, and all remaining surfaces, including the top, consist of highly stylized interlaced snakes. This interlace motif is even used to fill in the central vertical space, which is typically left blank.",
