  "text": "The photographer Jyoti Bhatt and his spouse, the ceramicist Jyotsna Bhatt (1940–2020), visited the Venice Biennale in 1966. While there, Jyoti made this double portrait of the couple, as their likenesses were reflected in a work then on view. The mirror panes split their bodies, with only part of Jyoti’s appearing in the reflection, and Jyotsna’s head and legs completing the body.  They both momentarily become part of the artwork by engaging with its reflective surface.",
