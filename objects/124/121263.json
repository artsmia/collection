  "text": "Aaron Spangler is a contemporary sculptor, draftsman, and printmaker whose work explores the sometimes overlooked social and political milieu of American rural life. Best known for his intricately carved wood sculptures and bas-reliefs, Spangler has also been active in the graphic arts in recent years, producing various series of rubbings, drawings, and woodcuts. This drawing is a preparatory study for Spangler's sculpture Songbird (see Mia 2016.35.2).",
