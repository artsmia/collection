  "text": "During his lifetime, Edgar Degas exhibited only one of his wax sculptures and cast three in plaster. Immediately after his death, 72 of his waxes were cast in bronze editions of 22 to 25 examples each. Given the scarcity of documentary evidence, the original dates of execution for nearly all the waxes are simply not known.",
