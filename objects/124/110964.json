  "text": "Rick Bartow is a Native American artist from the Wiyot and Yurok tribes of Northern California. The focus of his practice is depicting human and animal forms through painting and sculpture. Bartow traces his artistic influences to the European modernists Marc Chagall and Francis Bacon. Bartow's work is also inspired by his military service in the American war in Vietnam (1955-1975), with some references to his Native American heritage. Bartow often depicts transformational scenes, such as this painting featuring a human-like figure with a hawk head. According to the artist, hawks have made appearances at important times in his life. They appeared to him a few days before his uncle's death, and are often seen near his studio.",
