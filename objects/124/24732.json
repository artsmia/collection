  "text": "Although China Mania peaked in the 18th century, it experienced a revival among antiquarians, decorators, and serious collectors in the 20th century.  In addition to Doris and Leo Hodroff of Minneapolis, major American collectors included Henry Francis du Pont for his Winterthur Museum, New York tastemaker J.A. Lloyd Hyde, and dime-store heiress Helena Woolworth McCann.  The Hollywood starlet Delores del Rio once owned dozens of pieces from the 18th century dinner service made for the Spanish Duque de Agrada, whose portrait is reporduced above.",
