  "text": "Skyscrapers are familiar urban sights today, but in the 1920s they were still new and inspiring, a symbol of American ingenuity. Paul T. Frankl, an immigrant to the United States, got caught up in the excitement over skyscrapers and designed this bookcase to bring architecture inside the home in a practical way. Its cherry-red shelves look out like the windows of a building.",
