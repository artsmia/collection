  "text": "The complex recessed pattern that covers this elegant vessel suggests that it may have originally been inlaid with silver or turquoise. Although the geometric pattern is derived from highly stylized interlaced dragons, the ultimate inspiration for this rich embellishment may well have been painted lacquers or multicolored silk brocades of the Warring States era.",
