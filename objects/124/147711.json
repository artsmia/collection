  "text": "Ann Morgan designed this surreal &quot;outer space&quot; illustration as the back cover of the 1988 Sciences issue of the longrunning underground zine Artpolice. The otherworldly scene features two apparently weightless individuals peering into telescopes to observe the night sky from a pillared platform. Planets and stars hover in close proximity. In a humorous touch, Morgan draws the pillars and ARTPOLICE banner as if composed of jigsaw puzzle pieces.",
