  "text": "This is Aoki’s undisputed masterpiece. Having refined her technical skills, she sought to make a more complex object that would better express her initial ideas and demonstrate balance as well as struggle. The result is a glossy-black version of her earlier works. A body squatting on the floor appears to be swallowed by a lump representing helplessness and loss of willpower; this seems to morph into a body that stands firm and determinedly pushes forward. These entities represent two human beings in states of conflict and convergence, movement and tranquility. Intentionally modulated dents and protrusions in the sculpture are visible from all vantage points.",
