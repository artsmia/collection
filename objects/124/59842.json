  "text": "A native of Hangzhou, Lan Ying was an extremely prolific professional artist excelling at both landscape and bird and flower painting. Among the early masters that Lan Ying emulated, the most influential was the Yuan painter, Huang Gongwang (1269-1354) but the inscription on this work acknowledges its stylistic derivation to be another Yuan master of ink landscapes, Wu Chen (1280-1354). Lan Ying entitled his work, Angling in the Shade Amid Summer Trees, and signed it Jie Sou Lan Ying followed by two seals of the artist.\r\n\r\n<P>This scroll is labeled as having been reserved for use in the <I>Da Zhong Tang</I> or great central hall of an upper-class household. It is the sort of large painting that was displayed above a long table against the back wall in the central bay of the reception hall during informal gatherings.\r\n\r\n<P>While Lan Ying never found esteem as a true scholar-painter, he was immensely popular and enjoyed a respectable reputation in Hangchou where he was considered by some to be the last master of the Zhe school.",
