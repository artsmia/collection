  "text": "In northeastern Nigeria a mosaic of ethnic groups produce ceramic art, and it is not always possible to attribute a particular terracotta to a specific people. The many loops and dangling elements of this example are most common on ceramics made by the Longuda. This type of pottery was used ritually, in divination and healing ceremonies. Older figurative pots of the Longuda normally stand on a single, circular foot, so this two-legged figure is likely more recent.",
