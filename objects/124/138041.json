  "text": "At first glance, this golden shrine takes the classic form of a <i>chorten</i> (Tibetan for <i>stupa</i>), a domed structure that contains relics, understood in Tibetan Buddhism to be a three-dimensional representation of the universe, or mandala. The circular lotus base represents the cosmic ocean from which all emerges; the stepped square section represents earthly existence; and the rounded upper section represents the levels of enlightened existence. Yet this rare stupa was created in service of the Bon religion, a tradition that existed in Tibet before the arrival of Buddhism in the 700s. A Bon stupa is distinguished by a pair of horns, a reference to the mystical sun-eagle, placed near the apex, and the counterclockwise swastika, a Eurasian symbol of purity signifying everlasting truth in Bon.",
