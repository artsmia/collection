  "text": "This textile is an overskirt known as an aksu, which would have been worn similar to an apron over a full skirt or dress.  The large, plain swath of fabric at the top edge was tucked into a belt to keep the aksu in place.  Weavers of the Potolo region are particularly known for their vibrant animal designs, featuring birds, deer, dogs and mythical, dragon-like creatures, as seen on this example.  The Potolo region is also cold, being 15, 000 feet above sea level, so these overskirts provided warmth as well as decoration to the wearers.",
