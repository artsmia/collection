  "text": "Robert Barber is a painter and sculptor who loves the physical act of creation and is fascinated by the relationship between two-dimensional and three-dimensional objects. He constructs his sculptures by using pieces of scavenged cardboard. In Pink Cartons, the die-cut shapes and folded forms of cardboard boxes are readily apparent. It examines spaces, voids, and planes, all on a flat surface. Though sculptural in its analysis, the drawing’s making is painterly, with layered and blended colors.\r\n\r\nA Minneapolis native, Barber earned his Master of Fine Arts from the University of Minnesota in 1952. A prolific painter and sculptor, it would be six decades before he received significant public recognition. Then, at the age of 93, in 2015, the Tucson Museum of Contemporary Art organized a major retrospective of his career. He soon had a series of gallery exhibitions in New York, and this drawing was selected by a jury of famous artists as a gift to Mia.",
