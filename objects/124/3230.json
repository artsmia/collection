  "text": "To make her hand-colored photographs, Gloria DeFilipps Brush started with a black-and-white gelatin silver print.  She then hand-applied the hues with colored pencils and sometimes photographic dyes. For Brush, photographs such as 129.4 are meant to evoke spaces “within spaces.” Her compositions might also prompt those encountering them to imagine something new and build  their own stories.",
