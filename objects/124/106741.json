  "text": "Chatelain is a self-taught wood turner who began creating vessels in 1985.  Initially, his aim was to highlight the natural grain in the wood through turning.  Gradually, he adopted a mixed-media approach to woodturning, using laminated woods and filling voids in burls with colored epoxy resins.  Chatelain writes my greatest respect is given to craftsmen who integrate the constructed with the natural.  This piece, which combines an exotic wood vessel with a silver band, demonstrates Chatelain's aspiration to be like the craftsmen that he so admires.",
