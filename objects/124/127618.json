  "text": "The splashes and streaks that characterize the lustrous glaze of this flambé-glazed xianwenping bottle vase are described as yaobian or ‘transmutation glaze’ which was a Qing innovation. The technique came about through the imperial interest in various aspects of antiquity in mid-18th century. It is said to be inspired by the glazes of similar colors and effects of Jun wares that flourished during the Song and Yuan period. The revival of Jun ware-inspired glazes under the Yongzheng emperor (1678 –1735) is attributed to the enthusiasm towards flambé-glazed works.",
