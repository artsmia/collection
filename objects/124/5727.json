  "text": "The women of the city of Gafsa and the surrounding oasis in central Tunisia have long been famous for their weaving skills. One of their most prized items is the square-shaped, elaborately patterned ferrachiya, a cover made of wool that is used as a blanket or to decorate a bed. This fine example combines intricate geometric designs with the characteristic caravan motifâ€”a succession of colorful camels interspersed with a few human figures. Historically, groups of people and animals would travel together, in single file, across the North African desert.",
