  "text": "Irene Reed was a Connecticut-based artist who worked with a diverse array of media -- including found items -- and off-loom fiber techniques, but was best known for her crochet creations -- typically hats, purses, accessories, and small sculptures. An important technical innovation of Reed's was to create three-dimensionality by building crochet stitches over sections of trapunto quilting. The pendants on this crocheted hat are reminiscent of the beaded cornrow hairstyles that were popular in the 1980s.",
