Additionally, Zborowski may have owned the work at one time as well.\r\n\r\n[2] Germaine Bignou (Paris 1893–1965 Paris) was married to the dealer Etienne Bignou (Paris 1891-1950 Paris), of Bignou Gallery in New York, which was open from 1935 to 1950.\r\n\r\n[3]  The purchase was funded by Donald and Elizabeth Martin Winston, Los Angeles, California and Winston's sister-in-law, Martha H.

  "text": "Chaim Soutine was born in a poor eastern European village and continued to struggle as a young starving artist in Paris. His years of deprivation gave him stomach ulcers, so he abstained from meat and other rich foods. Soutine expressed his ambivalent relationship to food through paintings of butchered animals, which he injected with formaldehyde to prevent from rotting. When the flesh turned gray, he smeared it with fresh cow’s blood to restore its vivid color.",
