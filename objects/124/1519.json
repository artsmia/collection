  "text": "The ram represented several gods in antiquity. Sacred to Eros, the Greek god of love, it was also an attribute of Mercury in his role of protector of flocks. In the zodiac, the ram was associated with Mars in his planetary form and thus with the month of March. It also symbolizes strength, fire and procreative forces. This particular fragment may have once been part of an architectural decoration.",
