  "text": "In Islamic Africa, calligraphy is not only found on writing boards and paper, but also on blades, ceramics, and textiles. Woven into this cloth are two verses from chapters 21 and 96 from the Qur’an. On the right is “Taught man what he did not know, ” which refers to God’s gift of knowledge to humans. The left one, in which God addresses the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), reads: “We did not send you except as a mercy for humankind.” Such striking textiles would be hung in private homes, mosques, or Qur’anic schools.\r\n\r\n\r\nInterpretation of text:\r\nTaught man what he did not know.\r\nWe did not send you but as a mercy for humankind.",
