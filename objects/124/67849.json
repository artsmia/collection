  "text": "Richard Tuttle's multidisciplinary practice, which ranges from sculpture and installations to drawing and printmaking, defies easy categorization. Tuttle radically confronts artistic conventions and overturns expectations. Though his work may initially appear visually simple or even ephemeral, it grows more complex and nuanced on closer attention. Tuttle often manipulates the space in which his objects and images exist, emphasizing both the relative scale of his forms and the conceptual framework of his work, here expressed in the nearly empty surface of the joined sheets of paper punctuated at the lower center with a single black rectangle set at an angle.",
