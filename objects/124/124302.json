  "text": "This near-lifesize head of a monk possesses the warmth and tranquillity that is characteristic of the Song and Yuan period. The figure’s expression is serene, with downcast eyes indicating meditation and inward vision. Unlike the sovereignty and majesty usually expressed in examples of the Buddhist figures made in the early period dating from Northern dynasty to the Tang, this stone head appears more secularized.",
