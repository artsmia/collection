  "text": "Low wooden tables like this one were commonly used by Tibetan monks to support their sutras (sacred texts) while reading. The top surface is proportioned to accommodate the size and shape of a standard manuscript, and the height is convenient for someone seated on the floor. <i>Thangka</i> paintings show similar small tables being used as portable altars, set with offerings or ritual implements. Carved in low relief with religious symbols and brightly colored with lacquer, this small piece of furniture would have complemented the rich brocades and decorative architecture of a Tibetan monastery.",
