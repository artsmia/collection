  "text": "Muse's Fog (1960-1962) is indicative of the Abstract Expressionist period that was prominent in Western art from the late 1940's through the 1950's. \r\n\r\nMuse took up art after he left military service as a young man. He taught art in Newark, New Jersey, and his most famous pupil was the painter, Grace Hartigan. While most of Muse's later works are in gouache on paper this mid-career painting is representitive of his abstract style.\r\n\r\nFog is one of the few paintings by Muse that are avaible to be studied. A fire destroyed his studio in the 1970's, which contained works from the 1950's, 60's and 70's.",
