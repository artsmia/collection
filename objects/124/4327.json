  "text": "This unusual vessel, comprised of twin cylinders united by a phoenix surmounting a winged lion, is in a traditional shape that can be traced back over two thousand years. The vessel nowadays is commonly called a champion's or hero's vase, a pun on the words ying-hsiung, which the Chinese use to describe the vase. Numerous jade examples of this form survive from the late Sung, YÃ¼an and Ming dynasties (13th-17th century). Reverence for past forms is typically associated with China's educated elite, and this vase demonstrates the strong revival tendencies of the Chinese artisan. Used as a decorative object, this exquisitely detailed champion's vase conveys a sense of history, tradition and cultural continuity that would have appealed to a learned owner.",
