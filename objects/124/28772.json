  "text": "Opinions differ as to the use of the <I>yue</I> ware frog decorated containers popular during the third and fourth centuries. Water droppers for the scholar's table seem the most reasonable explanation. Small water pots such as this also appeared with other types of animal-head décor including the hare, the ox, and the turtle. All seem to have been designed as water droppers for use by calligraphers and painters.",
