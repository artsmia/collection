  "text": "Pothi Khana is the ninth major photo-architectural work of Singh’s career. Its photographic images focus upon a single subject—the archive—as conveyed through black and white and color photographs of the textile-wrapped volumes and papers (reflecting longstanding cultural practices of preservation) in two separate archives in India. The teak structures holding them are designed and arranged as a series of columns, suggesting the architecture of a library or museum. When taken together, these evocative photo-structures approximate the intimate experience of a visitor within a cloistered space of knowledge-keeping, and provide new grounds for contemplating the necessity of care for cultural records and heritage.",
