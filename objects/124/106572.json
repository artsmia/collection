  "text": "Internationally renowned for his pioneering work in the Kinetic and Op art movements of the 1960s and '70s, Yaacov Agam developed his own theory of contrapuntal or polymorphic imagery in which visual stimuli are activated by the shifting vantage point of the viewer.\r\n\r\nPace of Time demonstrates the conceptual basis of the artist's practice, which Agam describes as …the dynamic relationship and fusion of several independent themes, which are thereby completely transformed into a new pictorial event. The evolution of this relationship and fusion is revealed as the different sides of the corrugated surface of the [artwork] come into view….The extreme views form the left and right sides correspond to each of the two themes, which merge in an equal degree only as one looks at the [artwork] frontally.",
