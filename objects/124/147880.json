  "text": "This large, richly detailed hanging scroll portrays the Buddha Shakyamuni’s Parinirvana—his peaceful passing from the mortal world—surrounded by a multitude of grieving disciples, deities, and even Daoist sages. Painted during the late Ming dynasty, the work stands out for its psychological depth, vivid jewel-toned palette, and extraordinary inclusiveness. Each figure expresses a unique emotional response, from anguish to serenity. The presence of Laozi, founder of Daoism, highlights a Ming-era vision of spiritual harmony across traditions. Likely displayed during ritual observances, this scroll invites reflection on impermanence and the universal reach of the Buddha’s final liberation. Though requiring remounting, it remains a masterful and moving meditation on loss, transcendence, and cosmic unity.",
