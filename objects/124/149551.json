  "text": "<font face=Times New Roman size=3>  </font>\n<p>\n\t<span lang=EN><font face=Arial size=3>Due to an inscription on the published edition of this etching—this is example is proof made prior to the addition of that text-it is usually called “The Praying Nun.” But the woman who kneels before the shrine may not be a nun at all. Already in 1878, print scholar Andreas Andresen linked the image to the character Gretchen in Johann Wolfgang von Goethe’s “Faust.” A pious, working-class girl, she is courted by Faust under Mephistopheles’s orchestration, which leads to the deaths of her mother and brother. Pregnant and shunned, Gretchen suffers public shame, descends into madness, and drowns her child. In a moment of desperation, Gretchen places fresh flowers in a vase before a statue of the Virgin (Mater Dolorosa) and prays. Her redemption comes in prison when she refuses to escape with Faust. A voice from above declares, “Ist gerettet!” (She is saved), opposing Faust’s damnable bargain with divine mercy.</font></span>\n</p>\n<font face=Times New Roman size=3>  </font>",
