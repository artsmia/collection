  "text": "Mexican photographer Graciela Iturbide is known for her groundbreaking documentary work among the Indigenous communities of Mexico. Bringing a feminist lens to her practice, Iturbide has created a large and varied body of work representing a range of traditions, rituals, and everyday experiences relevant to Mexican women and families. Balanced in their composition, playful in their subject matter, striking in their tonal range, these photographs stand as prime examples of Iturbide’s talents as photographer and printer.",
