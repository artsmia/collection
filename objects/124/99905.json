  "text": "Metalware had an important influence on the shapes and decoration of both Chinese and Vietnamese ceramics. Chased silver and cast bronze vessels were often imitated in less expensive ceramics for utilitarian use and as tomb furnishings. Shown here is a small, circular stoneware censer intended for the ritual burning of incense. Next to it is a rare bronze censer which is the sort of vessel that stood as the model for the ceramic version. The tall handles on both vessels are typical of Vietnamese tostein censers.",
