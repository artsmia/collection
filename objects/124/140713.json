  "text": "John Wilson’s simple but boldly executed depiction of a street demonstration in which a Black man and a White man lead an injured Black protester to safety is a powerful example of the artist's graphic work and falls squarely within the artist's thematic and stylistic priorities. Created in 1963, the drawing was part of a group of figurative works Wilson produced as possible illustrations for an article in the Reporter magazine concerning racial equality. Though this particular drawing was not selected for publication, it nevertheless conveys a poignant yet hopeful message on social justice and the struggle for civil rights.",
