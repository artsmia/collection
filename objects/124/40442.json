  "text": "Shaped like an Egyptian onion, with an elongated stem and slightly bulbous top, this Art Nouveau vase displays Louis Comfort Tiffany’s creativity as a leader in American art-glass manufacturing. The organic form shows off Tiffany’s trademark iridescent glass, patented in 1894 and called Favrile (derived from an Old French word meaning “handmade”). The brilliant iridescent colors were achieved by exposing molten glass to metal oxides.",
