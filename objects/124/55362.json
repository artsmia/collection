  "text": "Isaac was the miraculous heir God promised to Abraham. And now God was telling him to offer his precious son for slaughter (Genesis 22:1-18). In this intimate exchange, the boy listens with equanimity and unshakable faith as Abraham explains why there is no sacrificial animal. The viewer participates in Isaac's realization that the sticks he just carried will—like the cross later carried to Calvary—bring about his doom. A shadow settles over his face as he comprehends his father's words.",
