  "text": "Wanda Gág made her own bent lampshade to produce the dramatic shadows in <i>Lamplight</i>. She loved the honesty of everyday objects and the associations they evoked. For her, this humble setting stood for a simpler, preindustrial time, in contrast to the blackened doorway, which suggests an unknown future. This image was first exhibited in January 1930, just a few months into the Great Depression. It became one of Gág’s most famous prints.",
