  "text": "Women made bandolier bags for men as prestige items and developed this Woodlands art form.  This bag is an exceptional early example of this genre.  A repeating X pattern on the panel alludes to the Thunderbird, a central being in Anishinabe traditional belief. Wavy, white lines along the bag's edge represent lightning which is associated with this powerful being. Shades of blue, green, and yellow not only highlight the intricacy of the design, but also illustrate the artist's originality in the composition of the bag. The ingenious use of color combined with elegant geometric and representational designs makes it a masterpiece of Anishinabe beadwork.",
