  "text": "The setting is a pier jutting out into a body of water. The incident that takes place here is mysterious prompting many questions. A woman dressed in a yellow waitress’s outfit rises out of the water, pulled up by her hair with an eggbeater held by another woman who floats in the sky. Who are these women? Had the waitress drowned? Is the woman in red an angel (or a demon)? The artist, Honoré Sharrer, loved inventing such open-ended and curious scenes. All of the details converge on a sky that consists of concentric rings – like a tunnel opening – suggesting that the pair will travel through the opening. Yet the opening is blocked by a carefully rendered image of a razorblade hovering in the sky. It adds a hint of menace to the scene and suggests a mystery to be solved.",
