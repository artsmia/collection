  "text": "Norma Minkowitz helped established crochet as a fine art technique. Minkowitz studied art at Cooper Union Art School, focusing on drawing. She still regards her fiber sculptures as three dimensional drawings, where crocheted cells stand in for cross-hatched lines. In the late 60s and 70s Minkowitz started making crocheted apparel and wearable art, becoming active in the emerging field of fiber art. Though some of her contemporaries experimented with crochet, Minkowitz was unusual for using thin yarns and small hooks, making her creations much more intricate and labor-intensive than those by other artists.",
