  "text": "Cizhou type wares with decoration incised against a ground of closely stamped rings were produced in North China from the tenth to early twelfth century. The precise ornamentation of objects from Tengfengxian and Mixian in Henan province often shows the influence of Tang dynasty (618-907) metalwork. This particularly refined pillow has been meticulously stamped and incised to simulate the elegant, floral scrolls and ring-punch backgrounds of the Persian inspired designs popular in Tang gold and silver utensils. Despite its stoneware hardness and basic geometric shape, the pillow with its concave top, rounded corners and brocade-like floral patterns gives the impression of being soft and malleable like an actual cushion.",
