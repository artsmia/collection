  "text": "This model represents the Purcell-Cutts house on its site, a lot 50 feet wide and 150 feet long. It shows the house around 1915, during the time the Purcells lived there, and so does not include the garage, which was added later by the Cutts family (on the lot's northwest corner, where the sidewalk meets the alley.) On the second-floor front facade can be seen one of the small, plain, square windows inserted when Purcell added a Pullman-style bed inside for his son James.\r\n\r\n[label needs to be cut to fit horizontal label wedge]",
