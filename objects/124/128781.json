  "text": "Sonetos del Amor Oscuro (Sonnets of Dark Love) was one of the last series of poems written by the celebrated Spanish avant-garde poet and playwright Federico García Lorca (1898–1936). Infused with themes of longing, desire, and forbidden love, the poems were written in 1935, inspired by Lorca’s secret love affair with 19-year-old Juan Ramírez de Lucas. The poems remained unpublished until 1984, though unauthorized editions were released earlier, including this book.",
