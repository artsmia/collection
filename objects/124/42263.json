She is accompanied by Mercury, caduceus in hand, the barely seen standard bearer carrying the imperial flag, and in the upper corner, Victory.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tFrom 1593 to 1606, the Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II waged war against the Ottoman Empire. Working in Prague, his court artist Bartholomeus Spranger designed elaborate propagandistic allegories which were translated into print by the bravura engraver Jan Muller who lived in Amsterdam.</p>",
