  "text": "Norbert Goeneutte can be seen as an artistic outlier. He kept company with progressive Parisian artists, but his own tastes and interests were so broad that he never fully allied himself with any particular group. Though noteworthy for his striking compositions, he preferred quiet subjects such as portraiture, quotidian scenes, and landscape.\r\n\r\nIn this study of an unknown model, Goeneutte closely observed lighting effects. He applied the Conté crayon with force, producing deep, rich tones. The composition’s eccentric, stylized proportions required him to join two sheets of paper. This sober, monumental image invites speculation on possible metaphysical intent.",
