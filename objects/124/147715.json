  "text": "Hospitals such as the one managed by Leprosy Mission have been working with patients for decades, providing much needed treatment. David L. Parker’s interest in child labor was what first drew him to photographing patients of Hansen’s Disease, and his medical training provided the tools to understand the need to destigmatize the disease. Carefully posed, the patient appears as an individual, and not merely a medical statistic.",
