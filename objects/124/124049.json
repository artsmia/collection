  "text": "This early example of Frances Barth’s geometric abstraction features her characteristic use of layered, manipulated media and strong contrasts of color and value to create a dichotomy between surface design and the suggestion of pictorial space. Here, Barth’s color functions as both atmosphere and object. The result is an internal tension and striking graphic intensity that is at once compelling and disorienting.",
