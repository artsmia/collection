  "text": "The drums of the Leele people were owned by the entire village and played at social events, visually and audibly embodying the community. This elegant, mortar-shaped drum is richly decorated with interlacing abstract designs and a frieze of geometric patterns. The undulating lines in the upper part may refer to running water, a theme also represented by the crocodile carved in high relief on the side of the drum.",
