  "text": "Walter Gramatté was a German painter and printmaker whose short career began with his discharge from military service in 1918 until his premature death in 1929. Despite poor health, financial difficulties, and unstable housing, he persevered to create a body of highly personal art that favored truthful introspection over superficial beauty. He produced some 200 self-portraits and over 100 portraits of his wife Sonia, a remarkable musician and composer. In 2021, the Eckhardt-Gramatté foundation presented Mia with a large collection of prints, printing matrices, and sketches that reveal his creative processes in depth. This collection includes trial proofs, variants, hand-colored prints, printing plates, and other rare material. We invite you to explore the collection on Mia's wed site and, by appointment, in the Hershel V. Jones Study Room.",
