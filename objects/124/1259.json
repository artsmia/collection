  "text": "Many of Rouault’s works reveal his strong Catholic faith. <i>The Crucifixion</i>, representing Christ’s sacrifice for the salvation of humanity, is a prominent theme. The thick application of vibrant color here is characteristic of the Fauvist movement, with which Rouault was associated. While other Fauves tended to avoid social or moral commentary, he used Fauve techniques to express religious conviction.\r\n\r\nRouault began his artistic career as an apprentice to a stained-glass painter in French Gothic cathedrals. That background shows in the thick black lines and bold, luminous colors of <i>The Crucifixion</i> and helps explain his stance as an artist: “I do not feel that I belong to this modern life . . . my real life is back in the age of cathedrals.”",
