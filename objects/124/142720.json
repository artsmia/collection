  "text": "Philadelphia-based artist Sarah McEneaney often depicts herself and her immediate surroundings, carefully observing her environment and presenting it to viewers so they can get a peek into her world. She said of this scene, I document my travels with small paintings on paper. They are finished works in and of themselves and sometimes lead to studio paintings once I am at home. [This work was] painted during a trip to Sri Lanka in 2002. My sister Anne and I are seen relaxing under mosquito nets and a ceiling fan in Colombo, Sri Lanka.",
