Satin was frequently employed by the painter and calligrapher Zhang Ruitu (1570–1641), but only around four percent of Kodōjin’s works are on satin. This painting and its counterpart Quiet Mountains on a Slow Day could form a pair of summer (this painting) and winter landscapes, or they might have belonged to a set of four, each portraying a season, only two of which are currently documented.",
