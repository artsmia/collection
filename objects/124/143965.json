  "text": "In Mercedes Dorame’s evocative image of familial bonds, the spectral figures of two unnamed relatives illuminate the soft expanse of a bed pillow. The figure at the left gazes at the young woman to the right, who turns her own gaze to the viewer. In this space of rest and dreaming, Dorame imagines communication with her ancestors as accessible, inviting, and restorative rather than haunting. As an artist of Tongva descent—a tribe she describes as having no “federal recognition, and therefore no reservation land and no gathering space”— Dorame gathers her relatives within intimate, domestic realms to honor their legacies and ongoing presence upon the land.",
