  "text": "Though neighbors, Japan and Russia established official relations only in the 1850s, not long after the American navy compelled Japan to end its long-standing isolationist policies and commence trade with the West. The anonymous painter of this work portrays two Russian soldiers, both in three-quarter view but facing different directions, in order to provide optimal views of the figures’ varied military attire.",
