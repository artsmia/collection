  "text": "This twelve leaf album consists of six landscape paintings with facing pages of poetic calligraphy. Both paintings and calligraphy are by Zhang Yin, the innovative founder of the Zhenjiang school. Zhenjiang is a small city located between Suchou and Nanjing on the south bank of the Yangzi river in Jiangsu province. Although a relatively small city, Zhenjiang produced several respected painters during the eighteenth century including Cai Jia, Zhang Yin, Zhang Qi, and Jiang Zhang. These paintings by Zhang Yin have a luminous lyrical quality to them. The compositions are kept clear and simple while the calligraphy is appropriately elegant.",
