  "text": "The design studio, under Win Anderson's leadership, created many Larsen fabrics that ranged from the dramatic and spectacular to the basic classics. The fabrics on this panel represent some of the company's most popular and best selling textiles. The hand-woven construction highlights the distinctive nature of the individual yarns that make up both the <I>Doria</I> series and <I>Haitian</I> cloth and the rich palette of <I>Shan</I> fabrics embody the spirit of the company's reputation for unique, high quality cloth.\r\n\r\nCoordinating the design and production of such a diverse line required unrelenting attention. For a number of years Larsen designs were being produced on five continents. Working with the most sophisticated mills in Europe and Japan while maintaining quality control in small workshops in Columbia, Haiti and Thailand demanded considerable flexibility in terms of communication, working style and scheduling.",
