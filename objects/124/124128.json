  "text": "The female figure shown here embodies one of Archipenko's strongest beliefs - that \"art need be neither realist nor idealist, it must only be true.\" he is considered the first Cubist sculptor and adopted this style in reaction to Impressionist sculpture, which he felt was too elaborate. He was inspired both by ancient art and by Rodin to regard the fragmentary figures as a complete work of art. Archipenko, also known for reintroducing color into sculpture, gave a turquoise patina to this torso.",
