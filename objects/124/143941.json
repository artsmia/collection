  "text": "Where is this landscape? Is this a place on Earth, from which we witness UFOs entering our atmosphere? Or are we on a distant planet, witnessing the UFOs returning home? Macena Barton composed this scene to be dramatic. The vantage point places us at the edge of a path, watching the spacecraft emerge from behind a mountain in an orange sky. When Barton composed the image, there was great political tension between the United States and the Soviet Union. Made the year after Russian cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first human launched into space, the painting conveys the excitement, strangeness, and adventure posed by the possibility of visiting other worlds. It also hints at anxieties around advanced technology and the unknown uses to which it might be put.",
