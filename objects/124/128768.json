  "text": "Allaert Claesz. has given us a front row seat at a mythological beauty pageant, which is said to have taken place on the island of Crete. Paris, a mortal of good reputation has been called upon to determine the fairest among three goddesses: Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite. Here we are in round one of the contest, when Paris found that he could not choose because the goddesses remained clothed. Eventually, the contest came down to bribery: Hera offered political power; Athena tried wisdom and military prowess; and Aphrodite offered Helen, the most beautiful woman on Earth. Paris opted for carnal pleasure, which triggered jealousies that led to the Trojan War.\r\n\r\nAllaert Claesz. did not invent this composition. It is closely copied from an engraving by the German engraver Hans Sebald Beham.",
