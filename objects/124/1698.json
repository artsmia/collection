  "text": "The subject of this bust, found among other portraits in an imperial villa in Turkey, is not known.  Scholars have proposed that the subject was a pupil of Herodes Atticus (103-177 A.D.), a Greek intellectual and government official for the province of Asia under the emperor Hadrian.  Well known as an orator and writer, Atticus attracted a following among young aristocrates. Although the size of the bust and the incised carving of the eyes are consistent with work from the reign of Hadrian (117-138 A.D.), the unkempt hair style and restrained use of a drill suggest a later date.",
