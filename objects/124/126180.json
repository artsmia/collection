  "text": "The unofficial wardrobes of Chinese noble women were less standardized but almost as sumptuous as court attire. The cut, symbolic content and decorative motifs vary considerably from court wear, while aesthetic considerations and individual taste are given far greater rein. \r\nThis Han Chinese woman’s unofficial informal robe is decorated with a symmetrically arranged scheme of multicolored flowering rose, peony, magnolia, daisy, plum blossom, “Buddha's hand” or finger citron fruit, and butterflies against a blue ground of satin. As flowers in Chinese culture are imbued with abundant symbolic associations, the auspicious overtones of this garment are as rich as the ornamentation itself.",
