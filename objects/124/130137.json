  "text": "This three-part series of images, or “triptych, ” depicts a drama in three acts: a vase suspended by unseen forces above an indefinite surface gains a bouquet of dark, fluffy carnations that, in the final frame, appear to be growing only larger atop the screw-like vase. The surreal qualities of this series render the otherwise innocuous flowers as something vaguely sinister, possessed of darker powers that enable their growth even after being cut. Beauty and death are therefore conjoined to powerful effect in Mapplethorpe’s series, rendering these otherwise ordinary objects as things of existential exploration.",
