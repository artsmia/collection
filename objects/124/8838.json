  "text": "Edward August Landon was born in Hartford, Connecticut, in 1911 where he eventually attended the Hartford Art School. Landon set out for New York City in the late 1920s to become an artist and focus on painting. By the latter 1930s, as a student of the Art Student League, he began experimenting with silkscreen. He was so enamored with the technique he gave up his paintbrushes and canvases in favor of screenprinting.",
