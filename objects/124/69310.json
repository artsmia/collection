  "text": "This image of a black carp is from a series that pictures aquatic creatures. The carp, seen from above, seems to be languorously swimming toward the surface. Not only did Kuniyoshi render the fish with great care, he also managed to convey the impression that it is beneath the surface of water.  Kuniyoshi's careful attention to detail, one of the defining characteristics of his style, is amply evident in this print.",
