  "text": "Traditionally made of animal hide and used to protect a warrior during battle, shields were often decorated with images that would protect their owners.  Robe Walker incorporated historical Plains Indian imagaery into this contemporary shield.  The flying bird probably represents the Thunderbird or eagle, and the turtle is often associated with life.  Because of their sacred power, these two animals were frequently depicted on historical objects.",
