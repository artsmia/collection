  "text": "This robe is decorated with peaches, pomegranates, and citrons (also known as “Buddha’s hand”) in gold against a purple ground. The motifs are imbued with symbols of good fortune: the peach stands for longevity, the pomegranate for fertility, and the citron for good luck. Together they constitute the “Three Abundances.” These, in combination with the endless knot motif in the neck and sleeve bands, mean the robe is emblematic of a long, happy, and prosperous life blessed with many children.",
