  "text": "This illustration was commissioned by al-Hasan Qivam al-Din w’al-Daula, an adviser to the Inju rulers (c. 1325–56) who briefly ruled the Iranian province of Fars, considered the ancient homeland of the Persian people. Here, the legendary warrior Rustam (in characteristic tiger robe) is seen with his retinue, greeting King Kay Kavous to report a victory. The flat, red background, textiles with Chinese-inspired lotus and peony motifs, and figures with cursory yet animated outlines—the spears literally pierce the surrounding text—characterize these rare paintings from the provincial Inju school.",
