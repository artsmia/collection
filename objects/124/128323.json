  "text": "The lyrical beauty of this dusky aerial view belies the painstaking process that achieved it. Susan Goethel Campbell combines extraordinary breadth of ink application with the precise perforation of holes in graduated sizes to produce a convincing sense of spatial recession in atmospheric space. She draws attention to the impact of man on the landscape, while neither promoting nor condemning it. For her it is simply reality, saying that her art “considers the contemporary landscape to be an emergent system where nature, culture and the engineered environment are indistinguishable from one another.”",
