  "text": "A crew of six women and four men was not your typical naval crew in the early 1500s. But the ship you see here is no ordinary ship: it is a metaphor for life. Guiding it safely to shore and pushing away the demons lurking in the water are personifications of virtues: Hope, Mercy, Perseverance, Divine Comfort, Loyal Heart, Faith, Charity, Patience, Good Will, and Prudence. These virtuous shipmates are presented here as the essential qualities a person needs to navigate the tough waters of daily life, avoid temptations to sin, and safely reach the shores of peaceful eternity.",
