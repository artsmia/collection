  "text": "A leading painter of the Ming dynasty, Zhou Chen was known for his vivid depictions of both landscapes and scenes of daily life. This fan painting captures a tranquil autumn riverbank: a fisherman guides his boat through rippling waters, while reeds sway and a tree with red leaves anchors the foreground. The combination of fine detail and broad washes reflects Zhou’s ability to balance naturalism with expressive, poetic feeling. By placing human presence within a richly textured landscape, Zhou evokes the harmony of labor and nature, an enduring theme in Chinese painting that conveys both seasonal beauty and timeless rhythms of life.",
