  "text": "Karsten Creightney’s color linocut is a metaphor for life. Set along a rural stretch of highway, the scene features a young, African American man who has escaped from prison and is busy gambling at the side of the road. With little luck going his way, the man has already lost his shoes. According to the artist, the scene is a metaphor for his own life and he used a self-portrait for the character of the gambler. As a working artist, Creightney explained that he has escaped the prison of a meaningless job, but every day is a gamble to make ends meet. He gave the scene a big blue sky to symbolize the hope he has for the future. In a larger sense, the scene symbolizes life’s journey and the uncertainties that we all face along the way. The vast and remote landscape also underscores the idea that one’s fate, like life itself, is ultimately a solitary journey.",
