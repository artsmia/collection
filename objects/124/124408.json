  "text": "This is a view of the ancient Swiss town of Fribourg as seen from the bluff above a ravine. The artist, Georg Ludwig Vogel, was a founder of the Nazarene art movement, which began when he and a few fellow students, dissatisfied with the Vienna Art Academy, formed a brotherhood. Four of them, including Vogel, set off for Rome, where they lived like monks and tried to recover the spirit of medieval and early renaissance art. After a few years Vogel returned to his native Switzerland, where he focused on the country’s glorious past. In this view he concentrated on the Gothic structures of town, ignoring the architecture of later periods. His use of outlines with added watercolor washes and his nearly bird’s-eye view of the town recalls the art of Albrecht Dürer, one of his artistic heroes, who had flourished three hundred years earlier. Though we may think of Vogel and the Nazarines as looking backwards, their rebellious attitude paved the way for revolutionary artists later in the 1800s.",
