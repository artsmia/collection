  "text": "For centuries beds were extremely important pieces of furniture that were frequently enriched with the addition of elaborate textiles. Bed curtains such as this panel, added a bold aesthetic statement complimenting the tastes of the period, to a room that was used as a social center as well as a place for nocturnal rest.<P>\r\nThe overall design reflects colonial appreciation of England's interpretation of the Indian floral style while the inclusions of animals and the diversity of the crewel worked embroidery points to the skill and sophistication present in the Boston area during the middle of the 18th century.<P>\r\n18th century American embroidery of this size and quality are extremely rare.",
