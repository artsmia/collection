  "text": "This rare club features a horned figure carved into the top, which may represent maymaygwayshi, or water spirits that dwell on riverbanks. Although usually nonthreatening, maymaygwayshi can be mischievous and may blow your canoe away from shore if you don’t show the proper respect. The long snakelike figures are mishebeshu, or underwater panthers. The ball club was an important weapon, so men often cultivated trees near the river bank, working over several years to establish a “crook” between the roots and the trunks of young saplings that would eventually evolve into a burl that could be carved into the circular shape you see here.",
