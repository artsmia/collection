  "text": "As the photographer Ansel Adams later recalled, when he entered the painter Gottardi Piazzoni’s workspace, “he was standing on the scaffold mixing paint. I asked him to just keep mixing, set up very quickly and made the portrait.” By Adams’s recollection, he was there briefly and wished to be almost undetected as he photographed the Tonalist painter at work. Piazzoni had been commissioned to make a cycle of murals for the San Francisco Public Library, and on this day in 1932, Adams chronicled him as he thoughtfully considered the next steps in a section of “Their Land, ” now in the collection of the DeYoung Museum.",
