  "provenance": "The artist (until 1913, sold, November 7, to Bernheim-Jeune); [Galerie Bernheim-Jeune, Paris, 1913–at least 1939] [1]; Gaston Bernheim de Villers, Paris (until ?1953/54, sold to Salz)[2]; [Sam Salz, New York, until 1954; sold, November 23, for $36, 000, to the Minneapolis Institute of Art] \r\nNOTES\r\n[1] Galerie Bernheim-Jeune was founded by brothers Gaston Bernheim de Villers (1870–1953) and Josse Bernheim (1870–1941), the sons of art dealer Alexandre  Bernheim (1833–1915). Mia’s Bonnard painting may have become part of Gaston Bernheim's private collection upon the death of Josse in 1941.\r\n\r\n[2] Gaston Bernheim de Villers died in 1953; his wife Madame Gaston Bernheim de Villers, Suzanne Adler (1883–1961), inherited paintings from his collection and may have sold Dining Room to Salz after Bernheim's death.",

  "text": "In 1912, Pierre Bonnard bought a country house called <i>Ma Roulotte</i> (My Caravan) at Vernonnet, a small town on the Seine. This painting shows the dining room there, with cats perching on the chairs and Marthe de Méligny, the artist's wife, leaning on the windowsill. Bonnard, who considered himself the last of the Impressionists, emphasized the expressive qualities of bright colors and loose brushstrokes in this picture. He united the interior with the exterior through the open window and door, and linked the forms by bathing them in related hues. Unlike the Impressionists, however, Bonnard painted entirely from memory. And like the Symbolists, he wanted his works to reflect his subjective response to the subject.",
