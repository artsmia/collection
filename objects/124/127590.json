  "text": "Shinique Smith's textile sculptures are self-referential and frequently incorporate clothing from her own closet, or repurposed items gathered from friends, family members, even the street. This sculpture speaks to the global significance of textiles as it showcases several different dyeing, weaving, and printing processes drawn from the textile traditions of India, West  frica, Indonesia, China, Korea, and the US. In crafting the sculpture, Smith contemplated how international textile motifs and techniques such as paisley, plaid, kente, dashiki, tie dye--even the ubiquitous denim jean--connect us globally.",
