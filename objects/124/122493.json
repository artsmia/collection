  "text": "On this portable storage chest, a wisteria vine emerges on the front panel (near the lock) and then meanders around the remaining sides and top. Joining the wisteria are three more springtime motifs—cherry blossoms on the gilt-copper lock and drawer pulls, dandelions on the front door, and a trio of dragonflies on the inside of the door. The maker used three distinct lacquer techniques to create these decorations. Gold motifs, such as the vine, stems, and some of the leaves of the wisteria, were made with gold powder applied to the surface, a uniquely Japanese technique called <I>maki-e</I>(“sprinkled pictures”). The darker leaves are inlaid lead. The radiant blossoms and leaves are inlaid mother-of-pearl, a technique called <I>raden</I> that was developed in China and introduced to Japan in the 700s.",
