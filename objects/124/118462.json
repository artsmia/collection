  "text": "On a damp and rainy day, a bunch of frogs are enjoying themselves with sumo wrestling. While two frogs are engaged in a bout, other frogs are sitting on the left and right to watch them while they hold their big round bellies. Each frog expresses a striking individuality, creating a richly humorous impression. Personification of frogs in human activities has been used in Japan since the Heian period (794–1180).",
