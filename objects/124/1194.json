  "text": "This painting depicts a romantic scene from the life of Rustam, the Persian hero of the <I>Shah Nama</I>, or <I>Book of Kings</I>. Here Tahmineh, daughter of the King of Turan, visits Rustam at night. The verse reads in part:\r\n\r\n<P><I>Towards the unconscious warrior's pillow stepped a slave with perfumed candle, while behind her came a creature lovely as the moon, radiant as the sun, and fragrant in her beauty.</I>\r\n\r\n<P>Although suggestive touches like this occur throughout the <I>Shah Nama</I>, the romantic adventures are didactic in nature and subordinate to the greater struggle of the good heroes against the forces of darkness.",
