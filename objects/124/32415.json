  "text": "A pagoda is an impressive part of a Buddhist temple complex, towering above the trees and dwarfing the neighboring buildings. A holy relic placed in the stone foundation or beneath the central wooden pillar makes the entire structure a focus of worship.\r\n<P>Pagodas seem to be the only architectural theme found in O_tsu-e. The artists did not attempt to render the pagoda's architectural volume or its complicated bracketing system. They depicted the essential elements: a stone base, white plaster walls, timbers painted vermilion, gray tile roofs, a tall spire of discks, and bells hanging from the corners of the eaves.",
