  "text": "An inscription in Devanagari and Persian script at the top of this rare signed folio reads: “The horse Jukaldan Ayragi with tenacious face belonging to the realm.” The painting is further inscribed in Persian script in the upper left corner: “Work of the painter Bhavani Das.” Records show that Bhavani Das was enticed in 1719 from the Mughal court in Agra to work for Maharaja Raj Singh (r. 1706–48) in Kishangarh, where he became the most highly paid of all employees in that state. Similar to a type of animal study popular at the Mughal court, this elegant equine portrait is an early example of the pictorial style favored by the Kishangarh princes. In this depiction of a piebald stallion, Bhavani Das displays the drafting skill and refined attention to the silhouette that made his horse paintings popular.",
