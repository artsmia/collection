  "text": "These guardian figures exhibit the classic elements of the mature Northern Wei style (386-584) including a rigid frontal pose, elongated torso and emphasis on lineal drapery patterns. The facial features are less stylized, however. With active and intent expressions, the heads turn, in contrast to the stiff flat bodies. These figures were unearthed along with two others at the entrance of a Northern Wei tomb in Southern Henan province. The four figures were likely placed against a wall where they functioned as guardians at the tomb door.",
