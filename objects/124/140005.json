  "text": "In 1961 Mimi Gross and her partner, the artist Red Grooms traveled through Italy with artist friends in a wagon to perform puppet shows and theater in towns and villages. The trip was rewarding for the artists and reinforced their feeling that art was for all people, all audiences and could be interactive and fun. Gross made this painting after the trip, and shows the group at a celebratory meal in the landscape around Florence, a joyous finale to their journey.",
