  "text": "This type of oil lamp was common in medieval Nishapur, Iran.  Made of a soft stone that is easy to carve, it has a cubic shape with four feet. The thin wall of the circular oil well is surrounded by deeply carved flanges that appear Y-shaped in cross section, which gives the lamp a deocrative, organic appearance.",
