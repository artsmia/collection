  "text": "<p>\n\tNakashima relied on honest hand craftsmanship, a respect for material, and simple forms. He was influenced by Japanese woodworking traditions, which he learned from a Japanese craftsman while in a Japanese-American internment camp for a year during the Second World War, and modernist architecture and design.  \n</p>\n<p>\n\tHis designs refer to Euro-American vernacular furniture such as simple Windsor chairs with vertical spindles. This bench with backrest is an excellent example of his adaptation of his modern Windsor chair to an asymmetrical bench. The spindled back extends only partially across the seat, leaving an extension to showcase the beautiful grain of the walnut specimen.\n</p>",
