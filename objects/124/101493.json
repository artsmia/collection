  "text": "This painting depicts two wise men in animated conversation under a pine tree. The inscription adds a layer of political commentary to this work, which Cao Xi painted around the time of the collapse of the increasingly corrupt Ming court. The poem implies that the men, despite their stooped statures, stand straighter (that is, have more upright characters) than the officials of the corrupt court. It reads:\r\n\r\n<i>Crippled Zhang, carrying dishes of food, off to visit kin, meets hunchbacked Li along the way, and\r\nexchanges words of wisdom with him.\r\nThe two men clap their hands in glee, and laugh out loud: Ha, ha!\r\nNowhere in this world is there a man\r\nwho stands quite straight!</i>",
