  "text": "Daikagura performers organized into traveling troupes at New Year’s in order to distribute amulets from the great Shinto shrine at Ise. They performed the <I>shishimai</I>, the dance of divine lions, and a variety of acrobatic feats. In this print, a group of women and children chance upon a Daikagura troupe. To the delight of one boy, an entertainer is doing a balancing act while simultaneously playing the flute. One of his companions keeps time by beating a drum while another unpacks. Other auspicious motifs in the composition include a view of Mount Fuji in the background and a blossoming plum tree, considered a harbinger of spring. The ideogram for longevity appears on the boy’s kite. This celebratory composition was probably commissioned for a poetry society’s publication of poems in commemoration of the New Year. Unfortunately, the text that would have helped identify the poetry group has been trimmed from the image.",
