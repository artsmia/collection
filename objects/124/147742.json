  "text": "Ann Morgan designed this playfully surreal illustration for the 1985 Secrets issue of the longrunning underground zine Artpolice. The scene features various anonymous doll-like figures attending an invitation-only cocktail party, drinks in hand. In the distance, a large menacing tornado has dropped from a darkened sky onto an empty landscape, catching the group's attention. Interpretation is left largely to the viewer.",
