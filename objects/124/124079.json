  "text": "John Armleder has been a driving force in Switzerland’s contemporary art scene since the 1970s. Here he pays homage to Marcel Duchamp, a hero of modern art who in 1935 introduced his Rotoreliefs, which were spinning disks that produced optical illusions of depth or three-dimensionality. One of Duchamps disk was entitled Lampe. In addition to appropriating the title, Armleder follows Duchamp's lead and coveys an illusion of depth by overprinting his lithographic stone using two colors, shifting them just enough to create the sensation of relief.",
