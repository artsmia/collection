  "text": "Amulets were commonly used by ancient Egyptians to attract prosperity and protect against harm. Amulets depicting the gods were often used to convey one of the many powers of that deity, such as protection, fertility, wisdom, or health. The Wedjat Eye, representing the healed eye of Horus, was worn by the living to bring wholeness and safety, and was often placed with the dead in hopes of earning them sight in the afterlife.",
