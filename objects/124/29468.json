  "text": "Within the cavetto of this shallow bowl is a lotus petal motif carved in shallow intaglia. Within the central circle is a group of concentric circles forming a lotus pod. This type of lotus petal motif was a popular decorative pattern during the Southern dynasties, in Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Fujian provinces in the 5th and 6th centuries. This was an era when Buddhism was in its ascendancy throughout much of China. A Buddhist symbol of spiritual purity, the lotus became a prominent motif in the yue ware celadons of South China.",
