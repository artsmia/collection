  "text": "The Chinese have played <I>weiqi</I>, or <I>go</I>, since ancient times and it is first mentioned in the Confucian classics of the fifth century B.C. Both men and women of the educated class played <I>weiqi</I> and to the literati, it became a symbol of the intellect. This <I>huanghuali</I> board is framed in <I>jichimu</I> hardwood and inlaid with silver. One side is a board for <I>weiqi<I/>, while the reverse is a board for chess, or <I>xiangqi</I> or elephant chess. The fluted bowls, used to hold the stone <I>weiqi</I> markers are also made of <I>huanghuali</I> wood. They are fashioned in the shape of a melon and the round lids are carved with an eight-pointed star pattern. These containers are generally made in a size that can be easily held in the palm of the hand.  <I>Weiqi</I> markers during Qing were generally made from stone or glass.",
