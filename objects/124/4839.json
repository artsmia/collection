  "text": "While serving as district magistrate in Shandong province, Zheng Xie also studied and produced poetry, calligraphy, and painting. Undisciplined, outspoken, and passionate about public service, Zheng resigned in frustration in 1753 and established himself as a distinctive member of the artists’ group known as the Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou. As an artist, he is known for closely integrating calligraphy with orchid and bamboo paintings.\r\n\r\nHis poem reads:\r\n\r\n<I>Bamboo and rock stand paired alone in harmony\r\nThe multitudes of plants and flowers are in vain\r\nSpring, summer and autumn cannot transform them.\r\nOnly the elegant plum has greater virtue.</I>",
