  "text": "This powerful image depicts three martyrs of the Revolution of 1830 rising from the dead five years later to find that they have died in vain. Rather than liberty, they discover that poverty, corruption, and fraud rule during the July Monarchy, as Louis-Philippe's reign was called. This would be Daumier's last political caricature for many years. Censorship laws enacted in September 1835 restricted the freedom of the press and prohibited imagery that attacked the regime, forcing Daumier to concentrate on social satire.",
