  "text": "Artists depicted iconic scenes from The Tale of Genji in a variety of formats, including round and folding fans, painted hanging scrolls, folding screens, albums, and containers. This box for personal items features scenes from chapters 17, 20, and 49. The scenes depicted were seemingly chosen not for their narrative content but rather for the season in which each scene takes place, with a winter scene on the lid and autumn scenes on the sides. The autumnal theme extends to the inside of the box, where fringed dianthus (also known as “pinks”) and white chrysanthemums dance across an area of gold paint.",
