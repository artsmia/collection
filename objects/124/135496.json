  "text": "These three prints show how Maki explored different relationships among colors, shapes, and textures. The weathered, dark blue areas, like painted cement walls that have survived a few seasons, and the irregular woodgrain shapes both reference nature. By juxtaposing these with abstract, debossed teardrops, ovals, and circles, Maki emphasized the incongruity of the natural and constructed.",
