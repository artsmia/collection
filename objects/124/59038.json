  "text": "These prints of walls are part of a set of six that Yoshida Hodaka created in 1992 for an exhibition at the Wall Museum in the Japanese city of Suwako, Nagano Prefecture, based on photographs he took of various walls. The prints’ extraordinary size, detailing, and attention to structural and surface features create an aura as if standing in front of the actual wall. Each print emphasizes one color: Red, Green, White, Rust-colored, Earth-colored, and Beige. White Wall, for example, is based on an old wall around a house in the Kyoto-Nara area.",
