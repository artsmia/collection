  "text": "Oskar Kokoschka was a leader among the avant-garde artists of Vienna, Austria, in the early 1900s. Though his style would change throughout his career, he was deeply engaged in the Jugendstil (Art Nouveau) aesthetic of the Wiener Werkstätte (Viennese Workshop) while attending the School of Arts and Crafts from 1904 to 1909. The limited palette of colors, intense patterning, and fairytale sensibility of this hunting scene are characteristic of Jugendstil. A half-century later, Kokoschka wrote a letter to art collector Eleanor Lawler Pillsbury (1887–1991), whose father-in-law cofounded the Pillsbury Company. In it he recalled making this drawing and others in the hope that they would be reproduced as calendar illustrations. Though that project never materialized, he achieved success with similar drawings for postcards and books.",
