  "text": "Look at the grain of the wood: it almost looks like a different material. This eroded figure was kept outdoors for decades, to protect a Moba village. It represents a female ancestor of a clan of the Moba people, and villagers used it in the past as a focal point to make sacrifices in order to ensure successful hunts and bountiful harvests. It was abandoned when the owners converted to either Christianity or Islam, two religions that view most traditional beliefs and practices as pagan.",
