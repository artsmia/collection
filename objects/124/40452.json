  "text": "In 1923, Rietveld worked with the painter Vilmos Huszár to design a model room - a total Neoplastic environment - for the Juryfreie Kunsthau, an art exhibition in Berlin.  His furniture for the room included this chair from which it received its name; importantly, it represents Rietveld's first asymmetrical chair.  The traditional elements - legs, arms, seat and back - have been abandoned in favor of a system of interrelated planes, asymmetrically balanced.  The armrest is broad enough to serve as a table - both right-hand and left-hand versions were made.  Each element is painted in a single color, the palette reduced to monochromatic black, white and gray.",
