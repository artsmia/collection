  "text": "Cast in the form of a hoofed beast, this container was created to hold water for making ink. A finger hole is positioned on the animalâ€™s back, with the spout hole located in its mouth. By covering the finger hole, a controlled amount of water could be sprinkled onto the inkstone for the grinding of ink. The creature probably represents a <i>qilin</i>, an auspicious mythological animal of good omen, whose appearance at the imperial court was a sign of heavenly favor.",
