  "text": "Firmly rooting her work in the traditions of landscape painting, the artist Claire Sherman brings us into a familiar, yet disorienting space. As brushstrokes overlap, so do the layers of the verdant scenery. The view is at once seemingly familiar, potentially a path likely in the woods, and disorienting, the distance between the trail and the sky could be a few feet or miles away. In drawing from her own memories or from photographs, Sherman is not depicting a particular path. Rather, &quot;Trees&quot; evokes the perception and sensation of such a scene.",
