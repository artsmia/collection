  "text": "This type of sash was created by French-Canadian women in L'Assomption, Canada, and was an important trade item for Native Americans. The design of the sash may have been modeled after 18th-century Haudenosaunsee (Iroquois) carrying belts. Many Native groups adopted the patterning and fingerweaving techniques of these sashes. Assumption sashes were highly used by the Métis, so much so that they became a symbol of Métis culture. Today, contemporary Assumption sashes are worn by many tribes in the Woodlands region during ceremonies and pow wows.",
