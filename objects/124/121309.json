  "text": "This beaker depicts the battles and warfare of different tribes in Mozambique, as described and imagined by the Dutch merchant Jan Huyghen van Linschoten (1563-1611), who had lived in Goa, India, for six years, and wrote an influential account of his travels through Africa and India. It was made in Leipzig, Germany, which was a center of trade, based on engravings in Jan Huyghen’s book. Such depictions of exotic places and faraway people were not always accurate. Here a Mozambiquian chief is pictured as a Native American.",
