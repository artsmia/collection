  "text": "This beaker was made as a wedding gift in the city of Leipzig, which was a commercial hub in the seventeenth century. African goods such as ivory arrived on Europe’s north coast and were transported south downriver to be traded there. The scenes chased in relief reflect this secondhand awareness of African culture. They are derived from the illustrations to a traveler’s account of his visit to Mozambique, en route to India. The tribal chief is depicted wearing a feather headdress, derived from earlier prints of indigenous Americans rather than of Africans.",
