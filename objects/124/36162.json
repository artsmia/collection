Communities participated in a dynamic exchange of goods with cultures far and wide, and cotton and wool became increasingly important as hides became scarce.\r\n\r\nThis drawing is one of 35 works on paper by Seth Eastman in Mia’s collection. It was the basis for an illustration in Henry Rowe Schoolcraft’s massive Historical and Statistical Information Respecting the History, Condition, and Prospects of the Indian Tribes of the United States (Philadelphia: Lippincott, Grambo & Co., 1851-57).",
