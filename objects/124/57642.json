  "text": "A gifted printmaker, Pieter Dupont emulated the meticulously precise technique and refined style of the Northern Renaissance master engravers Albrecht Dürer (1471–1528) and Lucas van Leyden (1494–1533). This minutely detailed depiction of a draft horse in a rural landscape displays Dupont’s skill with the burin, a tool used for cutting lines into copper printing plates. Horses featured regularly in Dupont’s graphic work. As here, he imbued them with a palpable physicality, enhanced by the shimmering light and sense of movement that permeate the scene.",
