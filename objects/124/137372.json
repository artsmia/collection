  "text": "Sculptor, graphic artist, and arts educator Kinji Akagawa worked as a master printer at the Tamarind Lithography Workshop in Los Angeles in the 1960s. During his tenure there, he honed his skills as a lithographer, printing editions for Tamarind’s visiting artists while also making his own prints. The experience left him with a keen understanding of and appreciation for creative collaboration. Akagawa later moved to Minnesota, where he taught studio art at the Minneapolis College of Art and Design (MCAD) until 2009.\r\n\r\nInspired by Akagawa’s deep love of the natural world, Here and Now: Re-View, Re-Think, i≠i combines three traditional printmaking methods within a single composition: a color woodcut of the sun, a color lithograph of the earth, and a monochromatic etching of the moon. The gathering of celestial bodies invites quiet contemplation, reminding us of the grandeur and mystery of nature. In keeping with Akagawa’s deep commitment to community engagement, he donated the proceeds from the sale of this print to the Kinji Akagawa Fund for Interdisciplinary Studies, a scholarship fund for students enrolled in MCAD’s fine arts programs.",
