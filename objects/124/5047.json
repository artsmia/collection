  "text": "Chen Chun (who was also called Chen Daofu) was regarded by many as the Ming dynasty's best classic flower painter, but he was also a landscape painter and leading calligrapher. A member of the Suzhou Wu school and elite circle of Wen Zhengming (1470-1559), Chen was a follower of Shen Zhou (1427-1509), founder of the Wu school. Chen painted many flower studies; his best are virtuoso ink performances.\r\n\r\nChen signed this painting with the seal “Daofu, ” an alternate name. The work also bears three collections seals of the Qianlong emperor (who reigned from 1736-1795). The inscription on the paper mount is by a relative of Puyi, the last emperor of China. Typical of laudatory colophons, it reads:\r\n\r\n<I>Baiyang Shanren (Chen Chun) expressionistic\r\nflower paintings created a unique style\r\nThe patriarch of flower paintings in the Ming\r\nHis brushwork is sparing and graceful, succinct in form and rich in content;\r\nIts meaning goes beyond the imagery, these are true masterpieces.\r\n\r\nSpring 1783</I>",
