  "text": "The Mexican artists Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera, their lives, and their work, have become legendary. Rivera sits, as Kahlo stands firmly just to his side in her traditional Tehuana clothing. Nickolas Muray brings viewers into what was Rivera’s San Angel home and studio, with its large glass-pane windows, and part of the compound to which the couple moved in 1934. The formal portrait is but one of the many photographs Muray took of Kahlo during his time in Mexico and during what became a lifelong friendship.",
