  "text": "This large waisted couch is constructed primarily from t'ieh-li-mu, a hardwood with a coarse, fibrous structure that is extremely dense and strong. Less expensive than huang-hua-li but, equal in strength, it was a good timber to meet the structural demands imposed by the long spans of the standard couch bed frame. Perhaps because he was working with a wood that lacked the innate beauty of huang-hua-li, the cabinetmaker has created visual interest by decorating the three solid board rails with dragon roundels carved in high relief.",
