  "text": "The Miao are one of China’s largest ethnic minority groups, scattered among several provinces, but mostly living in Guizhou/Yunnan plateau. They are famous for their embroidery skills and indigo dyeing techniques. Styles of Miao costume are diverse among the culture’s various sub-groups. A popular saying states “If you meet one hundred Miaos, you will see one hundred costumes.” \r\n\r\nMiao women combined weaving, embroidery and applique techniques to achieve the desired density of the pattern within their work. This black “short skirt” jacket bears sleeves that have been embellished using various techniques.",
