Panels in flanking columns depict luohans or arhats (the original followers of Buddha) as well as other worshippers, Buddhist emblems, and bodhisattvas (beings who have postponed their own passage to nirvana in order to guide others to salvation). The design is embellished with pearl, coral beads, and gold and silver metallic threads.",
