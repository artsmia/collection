  "text": "A model for Gorelick's paintings noted, the personal relationship came first when posing for the artist. Gorelick admired and bonded with those who would become her models. They had shared values -- often around progressive politics including activism in the Civil Rights and antiwar movements -- that brought them together. This triple portrait of brothers presents the men as confident, relaxed, and beautiful. They are self-assured and patient inn posing, who took great care in describing their features, clothing and body language.",
