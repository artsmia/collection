  "text": "Piet Stockmans started his career as a designer for the Dutch company Royal Mosa, where he designed a mass-produced coffee cup, Sonja. Nearly 30 million of the cups were produced since 1967.\r\nThis relationship with multiples on such a large scale provided an interesting point of departure for Stockmans's studio work. He regularly works in multiples for installations, for example casting the form of a tiny teacup for accumulation of thousands together or to distribute on a wall. He also produces numerous works, sculptural, functional, or whimsical, in porcelain editions, neatly packed, such as seen here. Although appearing mass-produced, these multiples are deliberate artistic editions. Always limiting himself to a palette of white porcelain and a blue slip, he has, like Irv Tepper, whose work is also in this exhibition, reinterpreted mundane tableware, to the delight of the viewer.
