  "text": "Geometry is critical to understanding Keobounpheng's artistic practice. The word's literal translation means to measure the Earth, but for the artist, it represents her connection to the world she inhabits. \n\nWHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE no.10 is an abstract portrait. The capsule shapes represent the artist and her husband. The bold, colorful petal pattern reflects the merging and separation of individuals over a lifetime. Unlike other works from the series, the artist embraced a more nuanced structure. The formal changes signify her shift from a binary worldview towards one that embraces complexity and interconnectedness.",
