  "text": "Nothing: 無\r\nThe subject of this print is the character mu, which stands for nothingness. Maki altered the character by elongating the form vertically and diagonally, enlarging the first diagonal stroke, and adding a white circle with a starburst pattern, at top left, and a small yellow teardrop stroke, at lower right. To viewers familiar with Japanese and Chinese writing, the character is recognizable as mu; Maki encouraged such viewers to not only contemplate how his additions and subtractions might alter the meaning of the legible character but also to focus on the visual form of the character itself.",
