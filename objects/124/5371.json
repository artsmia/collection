  "text": "This <i>haniwa<i>, or clay funerary figurine, represents a female figure. Her necklace of magatama (claw- or fang-shaped jewels of special protective power) tells us that she is a <i>miko<i>, or shrine attendant, a respected position in early Japanese society. Traces of red pigment on her cheeks indicate tattoos or ceremonial face paint. In her original state she most likely wore a wide, flat hairdo that extended over her forehead. Her right arm, although now broken, once held a cup, an indication that she was responsible for preparing medicinal or magical potions.",
