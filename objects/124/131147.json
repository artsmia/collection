  "text": "When Norma Minkowitz graduated from the Cooper Union School of Art, one of her preferred mediums was drawing. She still regards her fiber sculptures as three-dimensional drawings, in which crocheted cells stand in for crosshatched lines. The relationships among drawing, crochet, and sculpture are borne out clearly in Lunar Landing. Crosshatched lines move seamlessly into embroidered stitches, and the perimeter of the paper is “framed” with a crocheted border.",
