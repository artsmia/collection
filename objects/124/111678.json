  "text": "Alvin Tilley, an industrial designer who specialized in anthropometrics, worked for nearly 50 years for Henry Dreyfuss Associates in New York, one of the leading American industrial design studios. Tilley's studies of human proportions were published in several books and became fundamental references in industrial design. While his earliest work sought to establish an elusive average to serve as a model to guide industrial designers, his later studies eschewed the principle of designing for a single average type. Instead he presented the human body in various forms-from the 1st to 99th percentiles, and included infants, children, the elderly, as well as handicapped and impaired body types. The books remain essential guides for every industrial designer.    \r\nThe Measure of Man: Human Factors in Design (1967), and Humanscale 1/2/3 (1974).",
