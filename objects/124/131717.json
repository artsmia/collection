  "text": "This mōsen (felt rug) dates to the nineteenth century and is made of felted wool. Mōsen are dyed bright colors, and this example features a background of bright red with small white shibori roundels and large white roundels augmented with yellow and green dye. Because felted wool is so thick, decorating this type of fabric requires a skilled and experience dyer. This textile was made in Mongolia and subsequently exported to Japan where it was dyed.",
