  "text": "Hanukkah commemorates the victory of the Jewish people over Greco-Syrian rule. This victory included cleansing and rededicating the Temple as well as rekindling the lights of the Temple Menorah. To remember these events, Jewish people continue to light the candles of the Hanukkah menorah, or <I>chanukiah</I>, during an eight-day long celebration. The traditional blessing over the candles is found inscribed on the top portion of this benchform <I>chanukiah</I>:\r\n\r\nBlessed are You                           ברך אתה       \r\nLord, our God, יי אלהינו\r\nKing of the universe, מלך העולם \r\nWho has sanctified us                 אשר קדשנו\r\nWith his commandments              במצותיו    \r\nAnd commanded us                         וצונו   \r\nTo light the lights                           להדליק נר\r\nOf Hanukkah                                  של חנכה",
