  "text": "Woodcut artists in Siegfried Berndt’s day liked to carve planks from cherry, pear, and linden trees. Berndt preferred walnut, a harder, more difficult wood that allowed him the precision of a metal engraver, witnessed by the stiff lines of these sails. There is a vertical line below the middle sailboat where the ink has pooled, perhaps reflecting an imperfection in the paper or a split in the block.",
