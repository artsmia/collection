  "text": "As one of the leaders of the 1930s English linocut movement, Sybil Andrews first demonstrated an interest in block printing in 1922. By the end of the 1930s, she had created forty-three color linocuts, including this famous print. Produced in an edition of sixty, Speedway marks the pinnacle of Andrews's achievement as a modernist printmaker and shows her keen understanding of the color linocut process. Hand-printed on thin Japan paper from four blocks of incised linoleum (one for each color), her dramatic print captures both the dynamism of the speedway and the thrill of motorcycle racing in its rhythmic, simple shapes.",
