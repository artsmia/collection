  "text": "Ann Morgan produced the delightfully playful cover illustration for the Valentine's Day issue of the longrunning Artpolice zine series. Published in February 1982, Morgan's illustration was printed in bright red, emphasizing the traditional color associated with the romantic holiday. Here, a lone young woman wearing heart-patterned attire enjoys a sweet treat. Floating potato mashers and a border garland of leaves serve as counterpoints to the figure. Morgan's pared-down illustration reads as humourous and innocent despite its rather surreal atmosphere.",
