  "text": "The Dutch Mannerist Hendrik Goltzius was the leading printmaker of his time. A virtuoso engraver, innovative woodblock cutter, and superb draftsman, Goltzius continues to inspire awe with his wondrous technique and to convert even the most jaded art spectators to print enthusiasts. This print is from a series of fourteen engravings—Christ, the Twelve Apostles, and Paul—executed in 1589 when Goltzius was at the height of his powers. The series is a kind of demonstration piece displaying Goltzius's unrivaled technique and boundless imagination.",
