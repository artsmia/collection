  "text": "Made in the imperial Chinese workshops, large, elaborate seals presented in luxurious boxes were among the gifts bestowed on a number of Tibetan dignitaries who traveled to China’s capital for audiences with the Xuande (r. 1426-35) and Yongle (r. 1403-24) emperors. This presentation box is one of the few known to have survived to the present day, and was possibly given to a Tibetan hierarch in the early 1400s. It is decorated in the engraved gold technique (<I>qiangjin</I>) with a mythological creature called a <I>qilin</I> reclining in a sparse landscape. The auspicious mythical beast is regarded as an emblem of divine justice and the embodiment of princely virtue. The association of the <I>qilin</I> with both divine justice and virtuous rule made it an appropriate gift for political exchange.",
