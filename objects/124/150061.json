  "text": "This finely cast and gilded sculpture portrays Rolpai Dorje, the foremost Tibetan Buddhist authority at the Qing court and personal teacher of the Qianlong Emperor. Seated in meditation, he raises his hand in the gesture of teaching while holding a scripture, emphasizing his role as scholar and spiritual guide. The distinctive “Huthugthu” hat identifies his Mongolian lineage. Exceptional gilding, intricate robe patterns, and individualized facial modeling suggest an imperial Beijing workshop. Expressive and historically significant, the sculpture reflects the Qing court’s political and religious engagement with Tibetan Buddhism.",
