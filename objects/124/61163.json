  "text": "A calm has settled after a snowfall in the Nihonbashi district in Edo (modern-day Tokyo). Snow coats the roofs of buildings; pale blue mist ebbs and flows from the middle-ground into the background. In the distance, a snowcapped Mount Fuji presides over the city. The limited palette of blue, red, and gray, along with the white of the paper, summons the crisp chill of snow. Nihonbashi was the first stop along the Tōkaidō highway system that connected Edo with the city of Kyoto. In the series One Hundred Famous Views of Edo, Hiroshige depicted various locations throughout Edo in different seasons.",
