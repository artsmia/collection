  "text": "This Norwegian tankard was brought from the Jevnaker parish, north of Oslo to the United States in 1869 by Eric Steffenson and his wife Marie Andersdtr. The Steffensons settled in the Argyle region of Wisconsin, and the tankard was passed down through their daughter, Kari Ericsdtr (1847-1917) and her husband, Ever Stixrood. After Ever Stixrood's death in 1940, the tankard was given to Howard Marr, a grandson, who donated it to the Institute in 1988.",
