  "text": "At the turn of the nineteenth century, the most internationally acknowledged Dutch artist was neither Johan Baarthold Jongkind nor Josef Israels, but Charles Storm van's Gravesande. Unlike the artists of The Hague School and other Dutch regionalists, Gravesande -developed a thoroughly modern and personal style. Most of his career was devoted to the art of etching; he completed more than 400 landscape and marine views in this medium. His accomplishments were acknowledged when the government of Holland knighted him and he was awarded the prestigious Gold Medal at the 1900 Universal Exposition in Paris.",
