  "text": "All over Africa, women (and sometimes men) wear machine-made wax print, in both everyday and ceremonial settings. In the past, wax prints were manufactured in Europe and exported to Africa, whereas today many African countries have established their own factories, thus making these fabrics less expensive for African consumers. Wax-print designs often allude to political themes or moral lessons. This example is probably a reference to the fable of the goose that laid the golden eggs, warning viewers against greed and poor choices.",
