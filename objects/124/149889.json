  "text": "Nakashima Harumi is best known for his biomorphic forms of white porcelain covered with blue dots which he has made since the early 1990s. This organic sculpture dates from 1975 when he was just 25 years old and lived in Shigaraki. Entitled “Agony” (Mon), it is one of the few he created in reaction to the stoneware tradition of Shigaraki and the avant-garde explorations of ceramic artists in Japan since the 1950s. The sculpture’s tactile presence evokes biological processes like growth—transforming raw material into an abstract yet palpably living form.",
