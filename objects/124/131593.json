  "text": "The Ainu did not themselves manufacture steel; they obtained their blades through trade with the Japanese. Swords (emushi) were therefore rare and valued for social and ceremonial functions. Some swords were refitted with a new wood scabbard carved by Ainu men; here the sheath is covered with decorated metal pieces.\r\nContrary to the Japanese custom in the early modern period of carrying swords through the sash, an Ainu man used a fabric sword holder (emushi-at). Made by his wife or close female relative, the holder allowed the man to carry his sword across the back or over the shoulder.",
