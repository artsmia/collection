  "text": "Self-taught artist Rabbett Strickland paints epic stories of Anishinaabeg creation and recreation inspired by Greek mythology, Rennaissance and Baroque art. In this painting hero and trickster Nanabozhoo meets the healer Toad Woman, who holds knowledge of the entranceway into important lodge Nanabozhoo wants to find. In many stories translated and written by non-Anishinaabe scholars, this becomes a brutal encounter in which Nanabozhoo skins Toad Woman to disguise himself as her. However as a shapeshifter, Nanaboozho already has the ability to transform into the image of Toad Woman without causing harm, only needing to interact and study her. Featured here, Nanabozhoo, with human and Pan-like features, holds a dream staff as Toad Woman provides him with her knowledge of the entranceway through her rattle, expressed in the magical turtle figures circling him.",
