  "text": "Ketohs were originally plain leather straps worn to protect the wrist from the snap of a bowstring. They began to be decorated with silver plates soon after the introduction of metalsmithing among the Diné (Navajo). Primarily made for Native owners rather than the market, ketohs often feature an openwork design with four s-shaped bars radiating out from the center towards the corners. There is no practical use for these wrist guards since bows and arrows are no longer used, but men still wear them as ornaments on special occasions.",
