  "text": "Kaimaki are comforters shaped like kimono; they have a collar and sleeves to prevent them from slipping off and they wrap around the neck and shoulders. Padded comforters like this were sometimes part of a bridal trousseau. This one is decorated with the groom's family crest consisting of three oak leaves. The bottom is decorated with a pattern of pine branches and folded paper cranes, both of which are symbols of longevity.",
