  "text": "Portrayed here is a prince of the first rank, most likely Shi Wenying, brother-in-law to the Qianlong emperor (r. 1736-1795). He is shown formally seated on a lacquer throne in full court attire wearing a blue-ground audience robe, a winter hat surmounted by a ruby, a formal detachable collar and a surcoat emblazoned with dragon roundels. The hat sports a three-eyed peacock feather, a court award for meritorious service. All aspects of the silk costume, lacquer throne, and pile rug are exquisitely detailed. This painting was commissioned along with an equally grand portrait of Shi Wenying's wife, sister to the emperor, for use in ancestral ceremonies. The pair of paintings would have been hung side-by-side in the clan ancestral hall during rituals honoring the deceased couple.",
