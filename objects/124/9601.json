  "text": "By 1784 Kiyonaga had fully developed his style of depicting tall, elegant, mature women—images well suited to the generous proportions of <I>nishiki-e ōban</I> paper (roughly 15 x 10 inches), newly popular in the 1780s. Kiyonaga also increased the breadth of his compositions by designing multiple-panel prints, giving him scope for sweeping background views and complex compositions featuring numerous figures interacting in a naturalistic manner.\r\nIn the scene depicted here, a party enjoys <I>kawayuka</I> (riverside dining) on a platform built over the Kamo River, which runs through the center of Kyoto. Such temporary platforms built by nearby restaurateurs allowed diners to enjoy cooling breezes during Kyoto’s notoriously hot and humid summers.",
