  "text": "Although mounted as hanging scrolls, these four album leaves and their accompanying calligraphy sheets were originally mounted together in an album along with four other leaves each illustrating one of the Eight Immortals of the Wine Cup. An appropriate stanza is inscribed alongside each nobly drunken subject. Those illustrated here include Prince Ruyang, the devout Buddhist Su Jin, the great Tang poet Li Bai, and finally, Jiao Sui. There are several further calligraphic inscriptions. These descriptive and appreciative colophons were presumably contributed during the course of an extensive wine-drinking party. The artist, Zhang Heng, was a figure painter from Suchou active during the early to mid part of the nineteenth century.",
