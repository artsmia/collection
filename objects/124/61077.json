In this play, a traveler named Ju_bei is befriended by a local porter who invites the young man to his home. Through a series of mishaps, it is eventually revealed that the porter's daughter, Oyone, is actually Ju_bei's sister. In this print, Kunisada shows Oyone folding Ju_bei's jacket probably unaware, at this point, that they are siblings. Above, Hiroshige provides a scene of Numazu at the foot of Ashigara Mountain.",
