  "text": "In 1960 Hagiwara began with the ‘Stone Flower’ series and in most of the prints emphasized one or two colors that he then addressed in the print title, in this case blue and grey. “Thinking about eternal life I gave it the series the title ‘Stone Flower.’ A living flower has a short lifespan, but a stone took thousands and thousands of years to be created.”",
