  "text": "<font face=Times New Roman size=3>  </font>\n<p>\n\t<span>The temple complex of Cambodia’s Angkor Wat, built in the early 1100s, is an architectural and cultural marvel. Its stone structures stand as a testament to Cambodia’s long and complex history, and to the splendor of its setting within the ancient Khmer capital of Angkor. </span>\n</p>\n<font face=Times New Roman size=3>  </font>\n<p>\n\t<span>Kenro Izu has photographed sacred sites all over the world, but he has returned to Angkor Wat again and again. His photographs depict both its details and broader views—the delicate bas-reliefs and the buildings overgrown with tree trunks that emerge from their passageways. Izu’s photographs bring us closer to the artistry of each temple.</span>\n</p>\n<font face=Times New Roman size=3>  </font>",
