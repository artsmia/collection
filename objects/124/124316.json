  "text": "The legendary strongman Hercules was born to the god Zeus and a mortal named Alcmena. This union so incensed Zeus’s wife Hera that she made life almost unbearable for the hero. Her ire resulted in him undertaking a series of tasks, known as the Twelve Labors of Hercules. Sebald Beham challenged his audience’s knowledge of the classical text, engraving three actual labors and nine scenes of Hercules’ exploits before and after his labors.\r\n\r\nAt one point Hercules encounters the giant Antaeus, who insists on wrestling him to the death. Because Antaeus gets his strength from touching the earth, Hercules must lift him to kill him.",
