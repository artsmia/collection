  "text": "Oscar Howe is among the finest and best-known contemporary Lakota artists and is specifically noted for his ability to incorporate Lakota symbolism in his work.  Most of his paintings are of brightly colored warriors, horses, and hunters that depict traditional scenes in a modern form of painting.  In Lakota culture, one way for a man to gain honor was through warfare.  In this painting, the common form of weaponry, the bow and arrow, are being held by the warrior.  The extravagant eagle-feather war bonnet seen here was worn by proven warriors during ceremonial events.  Single eagle-feathers worn in the hair also symbolize achievements during battle.",
