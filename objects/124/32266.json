  "text": "Born and trained in Venice, Pellegrini traveled for 20 years throughout northern Europe, where his decorative paintings were popular among aristocratic patrons. This drawing is probably a study for one of several allegorical paintings honoring the life of Palatine Elector Johann Wilhelm, which Pellegrini made for Bensberg Castle, near Cologne, Germany. The Elector was known for his lavish patronage and his astounding art collection.",
