Our more perfect union deformed and abused. Despite, or perhaps because of it all, we must work together to build a way forward. To paraphrase the great Ruth Bader Ginsburg: “We must do something outside ourselves, something to repair tears in our community, something to make life a little better for people less fortunate than us.”</i>",
