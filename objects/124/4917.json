  "text": "This plate is from a large service ordered by Leake Okeover of Derbyshire, England, whose descendants still retain the design that served as the pattern. A shipping invoice from 1740 reveals that the cost per piece was about Â£1, roughly ten times the price for most armorial porcelain. The intricate painting no doubt accounts for the strong price, and designates this service as the most elaborate  armorial porcelain known to have been produced in the 18th century.",
