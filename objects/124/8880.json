  "text": "One of the pioneers of European modernism, Robert Delaunay was primarily a painter, only occasionally delving into printmaking and book illustration. Indeed, Allo! Paris! features his only original book illustrations. The book's subject is the rhythm and vitality of Paris, as manifested in its various architectural landmarks. Delaunay focuses on the Eiffel Tower, which at the time was the world's tallest structure and a potent symbol of modernity. The 20 monochromatic lithographs offer a glimpse of Delaunay's fascination with Cubist fragmentation of space.",
