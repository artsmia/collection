  "text": "Jules Chéret’s Belle-Époque confections enjoyed wild popularity and brightened the streets of Paris—gaiety previously associated only with parades and festivals. He is sometimes called the father of the modern poster and is credited with teaching Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec the intricacies of color lithography. The Musée Grevin, a wax museum opened in 1882, used this very popular design to advertise puppet shows and other spectacles. This example is without text, but bold lettering would be added for each event.",
