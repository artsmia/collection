  "text": "Appearing in Pueblo pictographs, paintings, and ceremonial altar designs, the Kachina doll or dancer is a supernatural embodiment of plants, animals, weather, and ancestoral power.  In this tradition, people become Kachinas after death and their spirits are brought back to life through public ceremonies held by community members.  During these public performances, men dress in masks and special clothing and dance with a wooden wand.  Both men and women are invited to dance at the performances, but only men are allowed to wear the traditional costume.",
