  "text": "As a child, Tōshi suffered from polio meningitis, which left one of his legs permanently paralyzed and made normal childhood activities impossible. Instead, he distracted himself by sketching and painting. To distinguish his work from the landscape art of his prominent father, he concentrated at the beginning of his career on the illustration of animals.",
