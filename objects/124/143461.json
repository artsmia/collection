  "text": "This carved wooden chest would have been used to store scholarly items such as writing brushes, inksticks, and seals. While many boxes of this type produced during the late Ming and early Qing dynasties were less decorated, conveying elegance and austerity simply through the perfection of lines and the material itself, this box is more generously decorated with its unique carved designs on the front face. This can be seen as a representation of the beginning of a gradually increasing preference for more ornately ornamented furniture as the Qing dynasty progressed.",
