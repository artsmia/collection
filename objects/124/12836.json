  "text": "This English slant-back chair provides a stylistic bridge between E. W. Godwin's early modern Greek side chair and Frank Lloyd Wright's severe, angled-back form.  While its exact designer remains unknown, its maker, William Birch Ltd., worked in the Arts and Crafts mode.  In this piece rustic details such as the rush seat and heart-shaped cutouts (a detail shared, if not borrowed, from C.F.A. Voysey) with the angled backrest extended above the chair's top rail in the exaggerated manner of Wright and the Scottish progressive designer Charles Rennie Mackintosh.",
