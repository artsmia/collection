  "text": "This skirt and jacket are part of an unofficial ensemble worn by a noblewoman of the late Qing court. The Manchu rulers of the Qing dynasty established a distinctive type of dress, including court robes which were a variant of their traditional clothing. Beginning from the middle of the eighteenth century, however, infringements to dress code were seen, and at the end of the dynasty, some minor fashion changes included the use of flat buttons, stand-up collars, pastel colors, and coordinated outfits. This set demonstrates the continuation and change of the Manchu woman’s dress in the early twentieth century.",
