  "text": "With slightly porous walls that enable a certain amount of liquid to evaporate, this spectacular pot keeps its contents nice and cool. That is of great advantage to the drinkers of the beer that this kind of vessel used to store. Made by the Mambila people along the border between Nigeria and Cameroon, the face of the pot has the protruding lips and eyes that are also commonly found on their sculpted figures and masks.",
