  "text": "Throughout her career Sheila Hicks has created both large and small works, often inspired by the same impulse. Her Treasures pieces were inspired by the many cultures that carefully use, reuse and finally recycle all of their resources.  All the elements involved in these objects have finished their intended life and now are transformed into a new manifestation.\r\n\r\nA number of artists of this period who created works made of composite elements encourage a variety of installation formats, depending on the gallery size and exhibit design. In this case Hicks not only encouraged experimentation, but two years after she completed this commission for the museum, she added eight additional elements!",
