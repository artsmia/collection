  "text": "Small colorful squares increase one by one as a reader turns the pages of this massive book. At first appearing like a pixelated digital image, the squares consist of small fragments of textile pasted together to reconstitute a larger piece again. \r\n\r\nFukumoto began to make “cloth inlays” when he was trying to figure out what to do with unsatisfactory textiles. Instead of throwing them away, he cut the textiles into tiny pieces. As a textile designer, initially the idea of cutting up fabric felt taboo; however, he soon realized that the rearranged fragments revealed subtle differences in dyes and created surprising juxtapositions. He uses a technique borrowed from East Asian mounting, in which cloth is backed by a thin piece of Japanese paper, lending stability and preventing fraying. This has allowed him to cut textiles into tiny squares or thin strips, which he then reassembles and glues together. The resulting work resembles a mosaic or patchwork.",
