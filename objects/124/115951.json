  "text": "This is an early work in a career known for clever figural vases and architectural installations for hospitals, corporate headquarters, individuals, and public buildings. \r\n\r\nOver the last forty years Dailey has been deeply involved in the world of studio glass. His foundation of the Glass Department of the Massachusetts College of Art in 1972 is only one of his many contributions to art glass education. He has also designed for companies such as Steuben Glass, Cristallerie Daum, and the Fenton Art Glass Company and in countries from Italy to the United States. \r\n\r\nSpace Gun is a piece of retro-futurism, a reworking of references from 1950s and 1960s space pulp comics, television, and movies, re-imagined in a fragile art form.",
