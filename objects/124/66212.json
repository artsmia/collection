  "text": "Early toasters allowed you to watch your bread toast, before they were encased in sleek chrome or steel housings. Four rotating wire holders surround a central, cylindrical heating element. Pulling the knob on any one swings all four in either direction, thereby reversing the slices simultaneously. Saluta was not the first manufacturer to introduce the novelty of toasting four slices of bread simultaneously (the Estate Stove Company introduced the idea in 1922), but the concept took a firm hold with Saluta. Saluta toasters went through a series of modifications, this being one of its later models.\r\nThis self-referential sterling toast rack was perfect accessory to the tabletop toaster. It allowed toast to be served and passed around the table without becoming soggy from the trapped steam.",
