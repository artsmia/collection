  "text": "Loie Fuller (1862-1928) was an American dancer, actress, and choreographer. She was pivotal in the development of free dance - the precursor to modern dance - choreographing not only her physical movements, but that of her silk costumes and her own patented theatrical lighting techniques. Fuller moved to Europe in 1892 where she grew well-beloved in Paris and became part of the Art Nouveau crowd and affiliated with Symbolism. She was connected to many artists and a frequent subject of works such as this sculpture of Fuller in her performative silk skirts.",
