  "text": "Since 1979, the spiral form has dictated much of Hunter's work.  Both <I>Rhythms in Chaos</I> and <I>Bahia Blossom</I> are from series he still pursues today, with carved flutes creating a voluptuousness of form.  From here Hunter started to open up his vessels by carving through the flutes, introducing voids, for example with <I>Retusa Phantom</I>.",
