  "text": "Bernar Venet is internationally acclaimed for his monumental sculptures made from torch-cut bars of COR-TEN steel. A master of linear abstraction in three dimensions, his sculptures feature stacked and intermingled arcs and spirals of steel in seemingly gravity-defying arrangements. Venet is also an accomplished draftsman and printmaker, often exploring themes directly related to his sculpture. Four Indeterminate Lines is part of a long-running series of abstractions that explore the infinite variations of the line as a visual and conceptual construct. Here, Venet takes full advantage of the technical and creative possibilities of intaglio print processes, producing a bold and dynamic image that mimics the texture, dimensionality, and visual weight of his rusted steel sculptures. Set against a stark white ground, the dark, interwoven lines of the image have an imposing spatial presence that seems to float above the surface of the sheet, an illusion of three-dimensionality that suggests the visual experience of viewing his fabricated steel sculptures. Published in 2014, it is the largest and most complex print Venet has made in any media.",
