  "text": "The life of a draft horse in Paris in the early 1900s was not always easy. Edgar Chahine, known for his sympathetic portrayals of working-class people, provides a glimpse here of the daily life of beasts of burden. A recalcitrant horse is whipped into submission by a driver unloading a cart of rocks along the river Seine. By the time Chahine made this print, automobiles had begun to replace horse power, but not until 1912 did cars outnumber horses in the streets of Paris.",
