  "text": "The artist identified as the Master at the Court at Mankot (possibly Meju) is prized for painting deeply felt, astoundingly inventive pictures. Here, the artist depicts one of the childhood exploits of Krishna, the 8th incarnation of Lord Vishnu, who comes to earth to vanquish evil. In this scene, the blue-skinned Krishna and the cowherds (gopas) take their cattle to a pond in the idyllic landscape of Vjraj, only to be disturbed by yet another demon sent by the wicked King Kamsa of Mathura. The giant crane demon Bakasura swallows Krishna, but the great god emits so much heat that the crane disgorges him; Krishna then tears the demonbird apart, ripping its beak asunder. The artist triumphantly depicts the spray of blood, as well as the crane’s now lifeless tongue. Throughout the painting, we also see the Mankot Master’s flair for pattern, put to mesmerizing effect in the otherworldly trees.",
