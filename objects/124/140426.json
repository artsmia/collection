We are in the midst of yet another surge, with new case counts going up in more than half the country. Our Great Leader proclaims that due to the “protective glow” he is now immune. Maybe. I wonder how many people feel that they are also “maybe immune, ” and continue spreading the deadly disease?</i>",
