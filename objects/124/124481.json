  "text": "Beginning in the late 1800s, the Comanche leader Quanah Parker brought the new Native American Church (NAC)—a fusion of traditional Native American and Protestant Christian beliefs—to Native communities across the United States and Canada. Fans and rattles are key objects in this religious practice and, like those displayed here, are also made as works of art. The fan’s brilliant scarlet macaw feathers create vibrancy and motion. The gourd rattle contains rocks that make a rhythmic sound, echoing the resonant beat produced by a water drum, also used in NAC ceremonies. A beaded hummingbird, resting gracefully on the handles, suggests life and flight.",
