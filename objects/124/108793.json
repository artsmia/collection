  "text": "Draper's vessels from the late 1980s show remarkable precision and careful planning.  She used a variety of exotic woods and inlay techniques to create contrasting patterns on the surface of her vessels.  At this point in her career, Draper shared a studio with Bud Latven, another well-respected woodturner, and together they experimented with polychromatic lamination.  In this process, thin sheets of wood are glued together to create a multi-layered and multi-colored block of wood that is then turned to create the final shape.  To construct vessels like this one with small openings at the top, Draper often turned one or more pieces and joined them together to create the whole.  Shortly after Draper created this piece, she left woodturning and began exclusively painting landscapes on canvas.",
