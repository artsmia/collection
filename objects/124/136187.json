  "text": "Floral Legacy, created by Dakota artist Holly Young, is a contemporary purse that pays tribute to historic brain-tanned hide bags adorned with quill and beadwork made by Dakota women.. On one side of this purse, the hide is embellished by a beaded floral stem with delicate and symmetrical flowers and tendrils. The other side features 20 thin horizontal bands of crimson colored quillwork and a tightly quilled floral design, bursting with color. Young then further embellishes the bag with wrapped tin cones, fire-red feathers, brass bells and thimbles tied with satin ribbon. Every seam and the entire handle of the purse is adorned with quills, a finishing technique that requires extraordinary patience and persistence, personal qualities highly valued in Dakota societies.",
