  "text": "Mark Tobey’s untitled monotype with handpainted additions, 1966, is a late-career example of the artist’s “all-over” approach to abstraction, which is rooted in his interest in Asian calligraphy. Tobey’s longstanding adherence to the B’hai faith infused his work a spiritual and constemplative element.  He achived considerable fame in his own time, and his approach to painting is often considered a forerunner to that of Jackson Pollock.",
