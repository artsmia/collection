  "text": "Anatole Demidoff, Prince of San Donato (1812-70), was one of the foremost art collectors of the mid-19th century as well as a distinguished scientist and explorer. In this portrait by Jean-Pierre Dantan, Demidoff is shown with the attributes of his collecting -- a classically inspired ewer and basin -- and tools indicative of his scientific explorations -- a globe, telescope, compass, and maps. The books by his feet and the pamphlet in his hand bear the titles of his scholarly publications on the natural history, geology, and anthropology of Crimea and southern Russia: <I>Voyage en Crimée</I>, <I> Valachie et Moldavie</I>, <I>Siberie</I>, and <I>Russie Meridonale et Crimée</I>.",
