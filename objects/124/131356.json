  "text": "Leonard Baskin loved the humanity of crows. He depicted them frequently. In the 1960s, Baskin and poet Ted Hughes embarked on a multi-year projects to produce an illustrated book of poetry on crows that evolved into an epic modern folk tale rooted in Trickster mythology. Many cultures throughout the world see the clever, disruptive Trickster as both hero and anti-hero—able to morph between human and animal at will, always willing to upset established orders for his own pleasure.",
