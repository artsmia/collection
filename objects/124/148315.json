  "text": "This deformed tea bowl dates from a short-lived period when practitioners of ceremonial tea gatherings vied with each other to push novelty to the limit. This so-called “clog-shaped” bowl corresponds to what contemporaries described as the “warped” (hizumitaru) aesthetic of Furuta Oribe (1544–1615), a distinguished tea master and samurai who played a pivotal role in the evolution of tea culture. The contours of the bowl are triangular instead of round, to appear random. The decoration of wisteria, traditionally associated with early summer, may indicate that the bowl was created or commissioned for use during that season. To create the bowl’s decoration, the black glaze was selectively scraped away and the exposed areas filled with white clay slip. This technique required exceptional precision, as each motif had to be filled separately with a translucent glaze rather than being coated uniformly.",
