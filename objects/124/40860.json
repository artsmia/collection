Its sleek streamlining is mainline American, but even more avant-garde is the black synthetic fiber inset in the handles--a daring statement when combined with a precious metal such as silver. Attributed to Barney, a principal designer at Tiffany & Co., the service was designed for and first displayed in the House of Jewels Pavilion in the 1939 New York World's Fair.",
