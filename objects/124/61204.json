  "text": "Most prints in Hiroshige’s series illustrate actual views, but this scene is imaginary. It is nighttime, and a group of white foxes are gathered around a large hackberry tree. Many more foxes approach in the distance, each of them with flaming breath, called “foxfire.” This eerie scene is believed to happen once every year on New Year’s Eve, when the foxes, messengers of the god Inari, help farmers predict the crops for the following year. Situated between the trees in the background is the Ōji Inari Shrine, where Inari, the god of fertility, industry, and agriculture, is worshipped.",
