Since the 800s, the Japanese have developed and perfected a way to layer metals, shells, and other natural pigments to create designs on lacquer, a type of resin extracted from Japanese sumac. Lacquerware is not only beautiful but also durable and thus was used for a variety of objects, both utilitarian and fanciful.",
