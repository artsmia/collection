  "text": "Kyoto-based husband and wife team Mutsumi and Misako Suzuki produce lacquerware of original design and subtle beauty. Mutsumi creates the finely carved wooden cores which he finishes in lustrous red or black lacquer. His wife, Misako, decorates the surfaces with designs in sprinkled gold and silver powder. The stylized clouds on this tea caddy is reminiscent of a common brocade pattern used for priests' vestments, and is thus appropriate for the solemn atmosphere of the tea ceremony.",
