  "text": "A lady and her personal attendant enjoy a quiet moment in front of a tranquil pond that blossoms with lotuses. The seated woman stares off into the distance in contemplation while smoking a hookah, while her attendant fans her with peacock feathers. Their sophistication is indicated by the strings of pearls, diaphanous attire, and hennaed hands and feet. Beautiful women were frequently the subjects of paintings made for elite patrons.",
