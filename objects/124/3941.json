  "text": "Though the imagery in this quilt might be described as “wavy” or “cylindrical, ” the textile is composed entirely of square and rectangular pieces of fabric. Contemporary American quilter, Jan Myers, manages to fool the viewer’s eye with her expert handling of color to communicate a sense of dimension and depth in a flat textile. Myers dyes her own fabrics and has long been influenced by traditional Japanese dyeing methods.",
