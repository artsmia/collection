  "text": "A dignified Ainu elder wearing an ornate attush (elm bark) robe is sitting on a cattail mat inside a dwelling, attending a ceremony. Above his right shoulder hangs a stick with a bundle of curly wood shavings (inau) used to attract and interact with spirits (kamuy). In fact, this painting, which may be based on a photograph, is packed with Ainu and Japanese objects; actual examples of some of them can be found in these galleries. \r\nIn the foreground are three lacquer bowls on stands, each with a ceremonial stick (ikupasuy) lying on top. These sets were used in libation ceremonies that included offerings of millet beer or sake. A typical Ainu dagger in a carved wood sheath and a Japanese short sword in a black lacquered sheath hang above him. Flanking him are large lacquered storage containers with three feet, called sintoko (Japanese: hokai). Highly treasured, these containers and the lidded bowl in the lower-right corner were traded from the mainland.",
