  "text": "Created in the later years of Kumakura Junkichi’s career, this work exemplifies the sophistication and conceptual clarity that marked his mature period. giving rise to a major body of work in the decade that followed. From 1970 to 1981, Kumakura created a dynamic collection of jazz-inspired ceramics distinguished by bold green and blue glazes, punctuated with luminous gold accents. These works reflect his profound connection to jazz as an art form rooted in spontaneity, rhythm, and the expressive power of the body. The angular, hollow form of this object evokes the aesthetic of mid-20th-century audio equipment—particularly 1970s speakers and related audiovisual technology.",
