  "text": "White peonies bloom amid blue and green leaves on the lid of this melon-shaped hand warmer (shuro) or incense burner (kōro). The object could have served either purpose during a tea ceremony: as a hand warmer, it could have kept participants warm during the winter, and as an incense burner, it would have filled the tearoom with fragrance. In addition to its large oval opening, the vessel has openings around the flowers, branches, and leaves, allowing for air circulation.\r\nMiura Ken’ya was a potter who led a tumultuous life during the transition between the Edo and Meiji periods. In addition to making ceramics, he studied shipbuilding techniques and other Western technologies.",
