  "text": "In early Indic religions, the pot-bellied Kubera was the king of semi-divine nature deities known as <I>yakshas</I>, protective spirits who guardedearthly treasures. By the 500s CE, the concept of Kubera, the god of wealth and abundance, was absorbed into Hindu, Jain, and Buddhist religious pantheons. In this sculpture, carved from a similar pinkish sandstone as the Mughal <I>jali</I> behind it, the deity holds in his left hand a cup for enjoying wine, and his now-missing left hand once held a sack of jewels. Befitting the god of riches, Kubera sits at ease, wearing elaborate ear ornaments and his sash relaxed, flanked by two female attendants fanning him with fly whisks.",
