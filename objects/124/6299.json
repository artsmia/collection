In 2011, the museum acquired the suite, along with two more original chairs.\r\n\r\nIn 2013 the chairs were conserved and reupholstered in period-appropriate fabric, a project made possible by generous contributions from Linda Ahlers, Darlene Carroll, Theresa Carufel, Ann Davis, Beverly Fiman, Carrie Herrera, Julie Kollitz, Sally Lehmann, Mary Lou Marsh, Patricia McCullough, Jennifer Komar Olivarez, Barb Pinto, Hope Thornberg, and Victoria Veach.",
