  "text": "The cover of this jar depicts sacred mountains populated with animals of Han mythology, mainly dragons, tigers and bears. Around the main register is a landscape scene with hunters on horseback pursuing wild animals. <I>Lian</I> jars were used to store small items, especially cosmetics. The mountain peaks seen here and on the <I>bo shan lu</I> censer are inspired by popular Daoism and its fixation on immortality.",
