  "text": "This striking octagonal bronze vase is decorated with irregular splashes of gold, a distinctive Qing dynasty technique prized for its luxurious, painterly effect. Incised across all eight facets is a repeated Arabic devotional inscription praising God, rendered with confident, accurate calligraphy. The presence of Arabic text on a Chinese bronze suggests production for a Muslim patron, likely connected to the vibrant commercial and diplomatic networks linking China with Southeast Asia and the wider Islamic world. Rare in both form and cultural integration, the vase reflects the global reach of Qing-era artistic exchange.",
