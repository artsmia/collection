  "text": "Yamamoto Izuru is the fourth son of Living National Treasure Yamamoto Tōshū (1906–1994) and an uncle of Yabe Shun’ichi, whose sculptural vase Wind of Light is in gallery 251. In 1968, Yamamoto went to Paris to study in the sculpture department of the university Beaux-Arts de Paris (formerly called École nationale supérieure des beaux-arts). In 1970, he returned to Japan to study under his father, and in 1975 he opened his own kiln where he builds his signature objects of layered clay like this water container (mizusashi).",
