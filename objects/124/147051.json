  "text": "<font face=Times New Roman size=3>  </font>\n<p>\n\t<span>A journalist once described Jud Nelson as “part Pop prankster, part Renaissance master, with a good dose of Minimalist strategist thrown in.” That is, humor, illusion, and meticulous craft lie at the heart of his sculptural practice. Here he portrayed a folded men’s dress shirt, one of several carved marble sculptures of men’s shirts he completed in the 1990s. These and other trompe l’oeil renderings are part of his ongoing series HOLOS, begun in 1971. In Greek, <i>holos</i> means “whole” or “total”; it’s the root of the word “hologram, ” or perfect three-dimensional illusion. Nelson’s sculptures celebrate both the original ideal form and its imitator.</span>\n</p>\n<font face=Times New Roman size=3>  </font>",
