  "text": "In Greek mythology, Orpheus was a poet and musician whose lyre could charm all who heard him play. In this scene, his wife, Eurydice, falls to her knees, transfixed by his song. Like many Symbolist artists, Maurice Denis explored the power of music as a theme in his art, and he was fascinated by the tragic tale of Orpheus, who followed his wife to the underworld after her death. His sorrowful music convinced the gods to allow Eurydice to return to earth, so long as Orpheus walked in front of her and did not look back until they reached the upper world. But the lovestruck Orpheus looked back too soon and Eurydice vanished forever.",
