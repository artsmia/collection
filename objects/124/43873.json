  "text": "A gifted draftsman, Thomas Hart Benton adopted lithography as his principal printmaking medium, its autographic qualities offering the same expressive possibilities as drawing. In the Music Lesson, Benton portrays celebrated folksinger E. Gale Huntington (1902-1993) teaching his young daughter a song on the guitar. Huntington was a local fixture on Martha’s Vineyard, a Massachusetts island near Cape Cod where Benton summered for some 50 years.",
