  "text": "Technique: Freehand resist dyeing (tsutsugaki)\r\nWomen of a household generally made bedding covers (futonji) from textiles they purchased and then pieced together. The dye work on this large textile is expertly done, suggesting the hand of a professional. It was made using a starch-resist technique, in which a sticky paste was applied to mask certain areas of the textile, protecting them from immersion in the dye bath. Whereas some techniques involved a stencil, generating a highly regular pattern, with tsutsugaki the artisan applies the starch freehand through a tube; this application requires significant artistic skill and knowledge of how to handle the sticky material.  \r\nLikely part of a girl’s marriage trousseau, this futonji is decorated with auspicious symbols of wealth and taste known as takara zukushi (treasure collection), which are associated with the Seven Gods of Fortune.",
