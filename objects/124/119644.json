  "text": "Tarot exemplifies Nancy Graves’ mastery of her unique approach to sculpture. Made from elements such as dried fish, plants, noodles, machinery, lampshades, and packing materials, the sculpture reveals more complexity than is apparent at first glance. In the layers of bronze and enamel, shapes of discrete objects emerge as recognizable but not entirely accessible. Taken from the everyday context of our lives, dressed in new colors and welded into new forms, Graves challenges viewers to see and experience all of these objects in a new way.",
