  "text": "Resembling guardian lions, these auspicious beasts (<I>luduan</I>), each with a single horn, are mythical animals credited with the ability of distinguishing between good and evil. Pairs of these legendary animals were used to flank the imperial thrones throughout the Forbidden City, where they served as symbols of royal dignity, virtue, and wisdom. The separately cast heads are hinged allowing for the burning of incense in the hollow case bodies with the smoke escaping through the open mouths. Used in combination with other types of censors placed in proximity to the throne, the smoke rising from the burning aromatic wood added to the atmosphere of formality and austerity when the emperor was in audience.",
