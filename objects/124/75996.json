  "text": "This unusually large vessel portrays a man with a hunched back, a common theme in ancient Mesoamerican art.  Individuals with this characteristic had a privileged position in these societies, often serving as attendants to kings and chiefs.  They were believed to have a special association with rain, clouds, the earth and caves.  The warrior's helmet and earspools on this example illustrate this man's elevated status.",
