  "text": "Anishinaabe artist George Morrison was active in the New York school of Abstract Expressionism, a mid-20th-century movement of avant-garde artists who saw abstraction as the essential way to convey intense emotion and explore the unconscious through color, form, space, and gesture. Though his work is largely nonrepresentational, Morrison routinely turned to nature for inspiration and subject matter. He began this drawing in 1960 while living and working in New York City and New England, often spending weekends outside the city to experience nature firsthand. In 1999, near the end of his life, Morrison reworked this drawing, nearly forty years after its initial completion.",
