  "text": "This resting water buffalo probably served a utilitarian rather than a ritual purpose. The holes in the back suggest it was originally some type of support and part of a larger grave object. The decoration consists of broad abstract bands against a ground of threadlike spirals, combining elements from both late Shang (c. 1300–1046 BCE) and Western Zhou casting.",
