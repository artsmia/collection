  "text": "While the earliest Chinese blue-and-white ware was made for the fourteenth century Persian market, this classic dish exemplifies the transition in early Ming towards the true recognition and wide appreciation of blue-and-white porcelain by the Chinese court and scholar class. The aesthetic preference in early fifteenth century ceramics was for a pure white, fine porcelain body acting as a bright ground to brilliant cobalt blue designs protected under a hard, clear glaze. The painted designs were continuous around the form; wave patterns on the rim, with twining flowers around the cavetto, the exterior, and in the center creating a beautifully elegant, unified composition. \r\n<P>The high level of craftsmanship here contrasts dramatically with the dish shown to the right which was made specifically for export to foreign markets. The shape is uneven, the ground a greyish-white, the blue designs pale and sketchy. The design also lacks the continuity of the imperial example with eight panels evenly placed around the cavetto crating a static effect. These panels were, however, very popular motifs in blue-and-white intended for the European markets. The Chinese dominated world trade in porcelain for nearly 800 years.",
