  "text": "Andrea Carlson’s Untitled presents sweeping lines of strong colors that melt into each other, creating a flowing, dynamic painting resembling the movement of water. While most of Carlson’s work is monumental in scale and addresses important issues of representation, history, and identity by incorporating figures, words, and repeating designs, Untitled is a smaller, intimate painting for the artist.",
