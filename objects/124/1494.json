  "text": "It’s cold outside, but indoors things are heating up. The occupants of this room pass their time drinking, playing cards, and flirting. By the fireplace, two young women tempt an old man with wine and caresses. At the table, two young men cheat an old woman at cards. One pretends to offer advice while holding up a mirror that reveals her cards to her opponent. Youth and old age, honesty and deceit, prompt action and relentless time, are all present here. A sober ancestor portrait of a woman dressed in formal black introduces a moralizing tone. Gazing from her oval frame at this opulent scene of corruption and temptation, she makes a contrast to the foolish old man and woman.",
