  "text": "Born to Korean-American parents in Chicago, Lee has challenged expectations about culture and identity with his work. In 2004, he earned his Master of Fine Arts degree at the College of Ceramics, at Alfred University in Alfred, New York, and then participated in a cultural and educational exchange in Jingdezhen, China, a historic center for blue-and-white ceramics. This experience, along with further travels to Seoul, immersed him in the forms and techniques of the blue-and-white porcelain valued and traded throughout the world for centuries. His blue-and-white porcelain vase exhibits perfect technique—carved, biscuit-fired, then covered with slip to fill the carvings with the excess painstakingly scraped away—but unexpectedly introduces a partial collapse into non-functionality.",
