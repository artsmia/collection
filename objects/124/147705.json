  "text": "A white crane seems to be sleeping under a pine tree as waves break on the shore. This folding screen is believed to have been painted by Yamazaki Joryū who lived in Kyoto. Very few works by him and details about his life are known. Joryū learned the Kano school of painting from Tsuruzawa Tanzan (1655–1729) and later became the teacher of Katsuyama Takushū (died 1788).",
