  "text": "Boating excursions helped alleviate the heat of summer in pre-modern Japan. A red lacquered sake cup seen behind the man fishing from the bow suggests that there may be more revelers (not in the print) in the stern. Nagaharu, who lived and worked in Osaka, designed several surimono for Osaka-based poetry groups. The inscription in the upper right corner explains that the print was published after Nagaharu's death. Kagen, who may have been Nagaharu's friend or pupil, added the flowers on the riverbank to the original design.",
