The hand-colored etching is one of an ambitious series of intaglio prints Smith based on Lewis Carroll's own manuscript drawings for his classic children's book Alice's Adventures Under Ground (1864). &quot;His [drawings] are gorgeous...perfect, Smith observes. &quot;Victorian is out of fashion, but I thought it was just this remarkable inventive period.&quot; In this and other works based on fairy tales, Smith depicts herself as a young-girl heroine, who navigates the tension between childhood innocence and budding maturity. </span><b>\n</b></font></span></p><p><span style=font-family: &quot;Mia Post Grotesk&quot;;><font size=3><span style=font-family: &quot;Mia Post Grotesk&quot;; font-size: 16pt;><span style=font-family: &quot;Mia Post Grotesk&quot;; font-size: 16pt;><span style=line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Mia Post Grotesk&quot;; font-size: 16pt;>The scene illustrates the chapter in Carroll's dreamlike story that describes Alice, who has shrunk to the size of a mouse, swimming in a pool of her own enormous tears, surrounded by animals and birds that have fallen in as well. Facing peril, the young Alice swims toward an unseen shoreline, leading her clutch of curious companions to safety. By these actions, Alice faces and subdues her fears amid the anxiety and vulnerability of childhood. </span></span></span><b>\n</b></font></span><b>\n</b></p><b>\n<font face=Times New Roman size=3>  </font>\n</b><p><b>\n\n\n\t<span style=font-family: &quot;Mia Post Grotesk&quot;;><font size=3></font></span></b><span style=line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Mia Post Grotesk&quot;; font-size: 16pt;><font face=Times New Roman size=3><span style=line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Mia Post Grotesk&quot;; font-size: 16pt;>For this collaboration, Smith used the largest copper etching plate ULAE's press could accommodate, drawing free-hand to produce near-life-size depictions of her covey of furred and feathered creatures. At the artist's request, ULAE printers transported the immense plate to the dining room of Smith's New York City residence, where she worked in private, often sitting on one section of the plate while drawing on another. Smith retained the unintentional scratches and marks she had left in the soft metal as evidence of her unconventional printmaking process.</span> </font> <font face=Times New Roman size=3> <b> </b></font></span><b>\n</b></p>\n<font face=Times New Roman size=3>  </font>\n<p></p><p></p><p> </p><p><font face=Arial size=3></font></p>\n<font face=Times New Roman size=3>  </font>\n<p>\n\t</p>\n<font face=Times New Roman size=3>  </font>\n<p>\n\t</p><p>\n<font face=Times New Roman size=3>  </font>\n </p>",
