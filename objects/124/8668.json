  "text": "Tomimoto Toyohina was a much sought-after geisha (entertainer) who performed narrative ballads accompanied by the <I>shamisen</I>. She was one of several non-prostitute beauties, including teahouse waitresses, whom Utamaro depicted repeatedly in the early to mid 1790s. Here she wears a headdress called <I>agebōshi</I>, used by fashionable women to protect their oiled coiffures from dust and wind when they went out. For this image, the printer rendered the <I>agebōshi</I> in pale pink mica to suggest the texture of silk.\r\n\r\nThis composition is from a six-print series comprising half-length portraits of famous beauties. The women are not identified directly, but their names are given in <I>hanji-e</I>, or picture riddles, adjoining the title cartouche. Utamaro may have used this device to circumvent an edict issued in 1793 that prohibited the naming of women in ukiyo-e prints unless they were prostitutes. Here, a lottery box (<I>tomi</I>), duckweed (<I>mo</I>), and a whetstone (<I>to</I>) serve to “spell” Tomimoto; a door (<I>to</I>), a lantern to suggest night (<I>yo</I>), and a doll (<I>hina</I>) signify Toyohina. This practice ceased in 1796 when a new proclamation specifically forbade the use of picture riddles.",
