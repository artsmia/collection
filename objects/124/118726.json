  "text": "Hattori’s poem describes the seasonal festivities of spring and autumn, and makes a number of references to Chinese court culture to create an air of sumptuousness. The references include the “Five-Horse Prefect”—a high ranking official allowed to retain a fleet of horses; Mount Li, where the first Chinese emperor was entombed; and the “pearl studded slippers” worn by the prostitutes of an infamously extravagant lord.  \r\n\r\n<i>The Five-Horse Prefect rides the spring wind, flowers seem to fly, Mount Li in the Second Month, vying in perfumed fragrance!\r\nIf he should spend the next ten days getting really drunk, No need to ask for friendship from men of cotton clothes!\r\nA noble feast among autumn colors, rain densely falling;\r\nAmber cups so frozen we simply can’t get drunk.\r\nIn days of old, we’ve heard of Orchid Terrace ladies, lovely as jade, And now we turn to view pearl slippers, guests numerous as clouds!</i>",
