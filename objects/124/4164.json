  "text": "Ferne Jacobs was born in Chicago to Jewish parents. She references her heritage by including Hebrew letters on the cascading tabs of this work which fuses coiled basketry with woven cloth.   Jacobs was a mentor to Minnesota artist Mary Giles.\r\n\r\nJacobs explains her process: “When I begin a piece, I create a line by wrapping thread around a cord, with a color that has been on my mind. From then on, I live in a mystery, creating each cell (wrap) and connection of what I hope is a living form. The cells make up a body, and I have no idea about what it will become until it is finished. Even then, I don’t understand the piece, and only know what went into the making of it. It is a very intimate experience.”",
