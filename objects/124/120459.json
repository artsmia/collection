  "text": "In the 1600s, the Dutch viewed indigents with mercy, derision, or intolerance. What Rembrandt saw was their humanity. This couple clearly has an important goal, as we see from the woman’s purposeful look and the sense of motion on the man’s foot. Rembrandt had one idea for the man’s hat but then made it taller, increasing his stature. He then used the etching needle like a quill pen, darkening the contours of the hat and other areas.",
