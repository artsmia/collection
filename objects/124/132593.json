  "text": "Meadow Muska’s visually impactful photography represents a significant and productive disruption into the narrative presented by Mia’s current photography collection. This narrative—dominated by Euro-American white male artists—fails to include the work of activist-artists like Muska, and all but ignores the significant cultural contributions of gay women across urban and rural areas of the United States. These beautifully composed print photographs act as a powerful counter-archive, relating a history ignored by prior generations and restoring the vital presence of queer women to American history.",
