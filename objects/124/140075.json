  "text": "Ever attentive to the relationship between form and surface decoration, Kamoda elongated his red ribbon-like shapes here so they swell toward the center and taper at the ends. This pattern is echoed by the overall shape of the vase, with its gently swelling belly and smaller mouth and foot. And rather than abruptly ending the pattern at the visible surface, he continues it onto the bottom and into the mouth.",
