  "text": "Specializing in wood-fired kilns, Lee In-chin harnesses the natural qualities of wood ash, sprinkling it onto surfaces where it melts to form glaze-like coatings. Born in Seoul and raised in Southern California, Lee began his formal training at California State University, Fullerton, before returning to Korea to complete his BA and MFA at Hongik University in Seoul, where he now serves as a professor in the Ceramics and Glass department. His experience extends across major ceramic centers in Japan, China, and the United States, where he has been deeply engaged in both studio practice and teaching.",
