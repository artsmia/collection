  "text": "Intended for sugar or sweetmeats, these boat-shaped baskets are typical of the silver produced by the famous Bateman family shop under Peter and Ann Bateman.  Peter Bateman, the second son of silversmiths Jonathan and Hester Bateman (whose work is featured in the adjacent case), worked under his father's, then mother's mark, until he and his brother Jonathan took over the family firm in 1790.  Jonathan Bateman died the next year, leaving his widow Ann to take his place.",
