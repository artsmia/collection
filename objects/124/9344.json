  "text": "In the early 300s, Korean potters began constructing multichambered kilns in hillsides. These “climbing kilns, ” as they are now known, were capable of reaching temperatures around 2, 200˚F, which yielded highly durable stoneware. One of the most commonly produced ceramic forms was a pedestal decorated with pierced, geometric patterns and surmounted with a bowl or jar. Discovered during excavations of tombs and palaces, these vessels are believed to have been used both for utilitarian and ceremonial purposes.",
