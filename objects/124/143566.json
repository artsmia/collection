  "text": "Apparels were decorative, usually embroidered, components applied to the front or back of dalmatics: T-shaped robes worn by Catholic priests. These apparels are exceptional for their workmanship, no doubt completed by a group of professional embroiderers who specialized in different elements such as drapery, backgrounds, and human figures. Featured at the center of these apparels are the Evangelists, Matthew and Luke, both shown as if in the process of penning his Gospel. It is likely that these apparels once belonged to a set of four, wherein the two others would have depicted the remaining Evangelists, Mark and John.",
