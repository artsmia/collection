  "text": "An early exponent of Neoclassicism, the German artist Anton Raphael Mengs spent most of his career in Italy. In this sheet of rough sketches, he seems intent on working out a number of ideas. Despite its hasty execution and numerous changes, two interesting compositional studies take shape. In the lower right-hand corner, Mary is lifting the infant Christ from a cradle. In the framed central sketch the Holy Family includes the young Saint John the Baptist and perhaps his mother, Saint Elizabeth. The less complete sketches reflect the fleeting thoughts of feverish creativity.",
