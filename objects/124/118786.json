  "text": "Gustaf Fjaestad made the Swedish winter landscape his hallmark. In hundreds of paintings, he explored the myriad effects of light upon snow. In <I>Winter Landscape</I>, he depicts a magical atmosphere, where a pair of ski tracks lead into the distant forest, suggesting the solitary enjoyment of a sunny, winter afternoon. He employs a personal form of Pointillism, using a pattern of dots and lines to create a snowscape of calm natural beauty.",
