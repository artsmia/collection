  "text": "Around 1768, Josiah Wedgwood perfected a black stoneware ceramic that he called black basalt, after a type of hard black volcanic rock that forms when lava cools. Black basalt was used for Wedgwoodâ€™s first strictly ornamental pieces, such as busts, plaques, and vases, and eventually also for functional domestic objects like this teapot, cup, and saucer.",
