  "text": "Op Art came into fashion in the 1960s as the public became wowed with optical effects such as spatial ambiguity, reversible perspective, linear interference, and chromatic vibration. Such visual amusements had been around since antiquity—think of mosaic floors—but the artists of the '60s exploited them to ever more vibrant effect, entering into the realm of psychedelia. Victor Vasarely explored the effect of curvilinear parallel stripes as early as the 1930s, but the '60s brought increasing intensity to his work and led to knockoff posters in head shops around the world.",
