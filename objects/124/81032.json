  "text": "A Venetian by birth, Giovanni Piranesi gained fame for his printed portfolios of Rome and its surroundings. Sixteen miles northeast of Rome, Tivoli is situated on a chain of hills near Mount Gennaro and was a favorite summer residence for Roman nobles. The Anio River runs through the town and descends about 300 feet into the Grand Cascade near the Gregorian Ridge. The Cascades were a major attraction for tourists on their Grand Tour of Europe. This etching is a fine impression from Piranesi's second version of the scene.",
