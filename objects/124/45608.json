  "text": "This is production yardage of the casement developed at Jack Lenor Larsen Fabrics from Laura Foster Nicholson's espaliered tree motif. It is one of two color ways which were put on the market in the 2000 Larsen collection. The other color way is on the opposite wall.\r\n<P>Notice how the edge of the clipped warp threads on the surface of the fabric add a subtle definition to the quality of the tree design, whereas the clipped weft threads on the reverse of the cloth surrounding the apple produce a shadow effect.",
