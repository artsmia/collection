  "text": "Du Dazhong, a Ming official, was a noted Suzhou calligrapher and a member of the Wu school group of writers associated with Wang Zhiteng (1535-1612). This calligraphy fan, carefully written in Xiao Kai Shu (small regular script), is the recreation of an extraordinarily dense prose poem composed by the Tang poet Yang Jiong (650-c. 694) titled Prose Poem While Leaning on the Study Desk, which the poet wrote on a paper fan in a moment of inspiration after gazing upon mountain peaks shrouded in mist and rain. The verse recounts the serious rigor of true scholarship. \r\n\r\nA few lines read:\r\n\r\n<I>Scholars have transmitted the classics and are involved in extending knowledge to the utmost...\r\nThey have exerted themselves in study questing after improvement...\r\nHow can a scholar sleep in peaceful withdrawal...\r\nLet him emulate the national craftsmen and develop their skill. \r\nMay he model himself on mountains and forests, taking them as his pattern...</I>",
