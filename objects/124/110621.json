  "text": "Nishihata Daibi came from a long line of Tanba potters. His father is the celebrated artist Nishihata Tadashi (born 1948), in whose kiln he worked until his untimely death in 2010 at age thirty-four. Like his father before him, Daibi used only clay from the region in his works, which feature age-old techniques applied to innovative, contemporary forms like this ovoid flower vase with dramatic deposits of natural ash glaze.",
