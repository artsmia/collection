  "text": "As a highly skilled woman artist in the 17th century, Elisabetta Sirani was a phenomenon. People came from great distances to see her in her hometown of Bologna. As a girl she was already considered a prodigy due to her fine drawings and paintings. Her father was a principal assistant to Guido Reni, the town’s leading artist; so, she had early exposure to serious artistic endeavor. \r\n\r\nIn this sober scene of the Holy Family, several elements foreshadow the fate of Mary and her son. She sits on a bed, a piece of furniture closely associated with images of her death. Joseph’s woodworking may allude to the cross, and the cloth being rolled by Elizabeth to Christ’s entombment.",
