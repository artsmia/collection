  "text": "The inscription on this jug poses a challenge: “Here Gentlemen come try your Skill../Ill hold a Wager if you Will…./That you don’t Drink this Liquor all../Without you Spill or let Some fall…” The perforated neck made it impossible to tilt the jug without spilling its contents. However, the hollow rim connects to the bottom of the cup through the hollow handle; together they form an internal conduit. The winner knew to cover all but one of the four holes in the rim, plus one at the bottom of the handle, then suck the remaining uncovered spout. The result?  A boozy, premodern “sippy cup.”",
