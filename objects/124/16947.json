  "text": "This robe is crafted from rust-rose satin embroidered with auspicious symbols. The back and shoulders feature an intricate network of tendrils worked in couched gold thread (couching involves laying metallic thread on the fabric and sewing it down with small stitches). Prominent butterfly medallions—emblems of transformation and immortality—adorn the back, while the front displays dragon medallions and two large dragons, all executed in colorful couched twist stitching. The black satin borders are decorated with additional dragons and lotus blossoms, signifying cosmic power and spiritual purity. Though now faded, the robe’s rose-red silk lining has a woven design of dragon medallions, reinforcing its ritual and symbolic function.",
