  "text": "Isezaki Jun is one of the most famous Bizen potters—in 2004, he was designated a Living National Treasure by Japan’s Agency for Cultural Affairs. Jun’s father, Yōzan, was also a potter, working independently since 1933. Jun eventually became more famous and successful than his father and his older brother, Mitsuru, whose work is also displayed here along with that of Jun’s son Kōichiro.",
