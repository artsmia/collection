  "text": "This bedding cover (futonji) consists of four large and eight smaller rectangular cotton panels. It is decorated with a vertical pattern of cherry blossoms carried by flowing water, a metaphor for the fleeting nature of life. Different types of shibori, a tie-dyeing technique, created the motifs: ori-nui shibori (folded and stitched tie-dyeing) for the water and makiage shibori (winding tie-dyeing) for the cherry blossoms.",
