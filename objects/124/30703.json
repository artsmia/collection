  "text": "Louise Nevelson is widely known for her sculptural assemblages, especially those made of wood colored to appear charred. Much less familiar are her drawings of nude figures made during and after her studies with Kimon Nicolaides at the Art Students League in New York. Nicolaides, author of the classic text The Natural Way to Draw (still in print after 75 years) made contour drawing the cornerstone of his curriculum and used Matisse’s work to clarify his lessons.",
