  "text": "Instead of incorporating pockets into their clothing, Diné (Navajo) men carried a leather pouch with a long strap that hung across the chest.  Most pouches were decorated with buttons that were secured along the entire length of the strap and the perimeter of the bag.  Some have a cast ornament attached to the center, as in this example.  These bags are often called medicine pouches because medicine people would sometimes use them to store and transport ceremonial items.",
