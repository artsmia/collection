The city area is divided in 17 wards consisting of 730 blocks.The streets are crowded with so many houses and people coming and going all the time. The number of houses is about 30, 000 with the 60, 000 population. According to an old saying, Frenches are like Spanish horses, which means that they are admirable, because there are many of them(?). Generally, French people are smart and hard workers. French women are virtuous and physically attractive.)",
