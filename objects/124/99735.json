  "text": "Shallow, elliptical wine cups in bronze and earthenware were popular during the Eastern Zhou (771–256 BCE) and Han (206 BCE–220 CE) dynasties, but lacquer cups of this distinctive form with wing-shaped handles were produced only during the Warring States period in the state of Chu, in present-day Hubei and Hunan provinces. The rims are decorated inside and out with a wide border of wing-and-scroll motifs in a repeating pattern. The tops of the handles are decorated with detached scroll motifs, with a running deer on one handle and a long-tailed bird on the other.",
