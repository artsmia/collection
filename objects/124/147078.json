  "text": "Produced in the 1980s, Jack Perlmutter's unconventional self-portrait is characteristic of the artist's penchant for blending elements of naturalistic realism and abstraction. Likely based on a photograph, Perlmutter depicts himself wearing a black Greek fisherman's cap and sunglasses. To heighten the work's visual punch, he cropped the original image to emphasize his eyes, mustache, and facial expression, while replacing naturalistic color with dazzling tones of red, orange, and blue. Perlmutter would have been in his sixties when he created this print, and reveals how he wished to be perceived.",
