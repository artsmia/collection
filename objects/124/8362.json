  "text": "This pair of neoclassical vases is beautifully decorated with gilt bronze mounts and painted Chinoiserie scenes, probably influenced by the work of Jean Pillement (1728-1808) or Francois Boucher (1703-70).  The objects illustrate a collaboration between painters, gilders, and bronze makers at the famous Sèvres porcelain factory.  A similar pair of vases, originally owned by Marie Antoinette at Versailles, are now in the English royal collection.",
