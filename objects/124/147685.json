  "text": "Manuel Carrillo came to photography later in life, at the age of forty-nine. From that moment onwards he set out to photograph throughout the country of Mexico, focusing mainly on its people. Children to adults, in groups and as individuals, appear posed or going about their days. Photographs such as this one are a hallmark of Carrillo's documentary style, one filled with respect for his sitters and their lives.",
