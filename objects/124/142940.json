  "text": "Ultimately photography is about who you are. It's the seeking of truth in relation to yourself. And seeking truth becomes a habit... My photos convey what I believe is my truth, expressed through my ability as an artist... The photographer has to discover and capture what is unique in each and every person... I am not particularly interested in being up-to-date on the latest technological developments. I'm more involved with the people in the world around me and their relationship to the world around them. I use technology simply as a tool to penetrate this world. After all, the photos I take don't come from the camera but from me.\r\n\r\n-  Leonard Freed",
