  "text": "Unlike many of Morrison’s earlier drawings and paintings that began with observations and abstractions from nature, this tempera painting has no discernable subject matter. Exuberant and spontaneous, it is an example of Morrison’s take on the abstract expressionist need to reveal the evocative power of the subconscious as a material entity. Here, Morrison’s vigorously brushed patches of rich color emphasize the spontaneous gestures and process of painting. They also form a richly textured and layered surface that invites close inspection. Sometimes called “action painting, ” Morrison’s approach was both intuitive and subjective, generating meaning through gesture, color, and spatial effects. In his typically low-key manner, he noted: “My involvement with the painterly tangibles of color, form and texture is my primary concern.”",
