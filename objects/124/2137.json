  "text": "Before Mozambique won its independence from Portuguese colonialism in 1975, Makonde men and women significantly modified their bodies in the name of beauty, as shown on this mask. The modification began at puberty as an important step toward maturity and cultural belonging, enlivening the face and framing the features with tattoos, chipped teeth, and a shaved hairline. Men wore wooden masks like this one at public dance performances, accompanied by drummers and a chorus. The carved hair comb and barrette on the mask show that not all the facial decoration was permanent.",
