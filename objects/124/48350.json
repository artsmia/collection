  "text": "The prolific printmaker Charles-Émile Jacque was renowned for rural scenes featuring cows, horses, and other farm animals. Here, the horses of guests arriving after dark at a country inn are brought to the stable. Accentuating the shadowy atmosphere, the figures are illuminated only by light from a single lantern held by a laborer. Jacque greatly admired the etchings and drypoints of Rembrandt, whose dramatic night scenes likely served as the model for this print.",
