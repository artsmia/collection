  "text": "His signature pieces are organic, sculptural forms made with tiger bamboo (torachiku). This piece is made of yadake and madake, materials that recall the work of Chikuunsai III, in a parallel arrangement that combines many different weaving techniques. “Warrior” (Mononofu) resembles a suit of armor with light shoulder guards and a reinforced breast plate in the center. According to the artist, it represents the strong spirit of Bushido.\r\nSimilar work illustrated in Tanabe Chikuunsai III, and Tanabe Shōchiku. “Tanabe Chikuunsai rekidai ni miru: Sakai no bunka to takekago shi.” Me no me, no. 8 (2007): p. 41.",
