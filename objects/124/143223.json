  "text": "Ecuadorian-born, New York based artist Ronny Quevedo draws inspiration for his multidisciplinary practice from the historically marginalized indigenous cultures of South and Central America, exploring questions about lineage, migration, and the socio-political implications of contemporary identities. In the collage inti – killa, which translates from the Quechua language into English as Sun – Moon, Quevedo incorporates pre-Columbian iconographies and languages of abstraction to form a geometric image that evokes the duality of sun and moon, day and night, and warmth and coolness. Astral bodies and the observed movements of the sun, moon, and stars were integral to many pre-Columbian beliefs, rituals, and calendars. Using meticulously cut sections of silver and gold leaf adhered to carbon paper, Quevedo merges the formal, material and conceptual into a symbolic abstraction that both honors and acknowledges his ancestral heritage and Ecuadorian-American identity.",
