  "text": "This is a manta, a textile often worn over the shoulders by men and women. The garment most likely came from the Aymara region of present-day Bolivia and appears to be woven in a warp-faced pattern in which tightly spun warp yarns create small designs and stripes. This mantleâ€™s central band has small geometric designs of repeating straight lines and crosses and features small birds, either representations of the animal or symbols with magical associations, perhaps referring to a sky deity.",
