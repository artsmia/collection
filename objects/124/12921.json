Celebrated Minnesota author and poet Robert Bly contributed 15 poems to the project. Each of the poems is accompanied by an original wood engraving or woodcut by one of 15 artists who were invited to visually interpret Bly's poetry. Designed by Amy Brooks Kirkpatrick, this deluxe copy of the book was bound by Minneapolis bookbinder Dennis Ruud, who also fabricated the barn wood box.",
