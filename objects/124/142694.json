It was commissioned for the exhibition “Designing Women II: Masters, Mavericks, Mavens” held at the Egg Collective showroom in New York City in 2018. It is one of only two large-scale wall-mounted works created throughout her career. The other was the similarly titled “Totem Field, ” which she created for the 10th International Triennial of Tapestry, Lodz Poland, now held in a private collection.",
