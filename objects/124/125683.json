  "text": "For 45 years, Austrian artist Susanne Wenger lived in the African nation of Nigeria, where she honed her artistic practice and served as a priest in Yoruba religious ceremonies. This journal-like artist’s book presents a dynamic visual account of Wenger’s inner thoughts during her spiritual practice of meditation. The combination of calligraphic text and gestural drawings lends the book a sense of spontaneity, immediacy, and mystery.",
