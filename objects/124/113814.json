Transformed by the Romans into a luxury resort around 200-100 BCE, Tivoli has subsequently experienced warfare and rebuilding, resulting in a remarkable array of villas, churches, temples, and tombs. The spectacular site and monuments have attracted visitors for hundreds of years.\r\n\r\nArthur Fripp went there during his 1834 trip to Europe and used his sketches for years after his return to England.",
