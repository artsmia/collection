  "text": "After receiving his training in Edinburgh and Paris, Scotland born artist Paul Binnie moved to Japan in 1993 to study woodblock printing. His work is greatly informed by modern Japanese print artists in the shin-hanga movement—artists such as Kawase Hasui, Ito Shinsui, and Natori Shunsen—and his work has taken up subjects often found therein, including actors, beautiful women, and landscapes. The present landscape print is Binnie’s largest to date and was inspired by the work of Yoshida Hiroshi (1876–1950). It is intended to be the first of a series of prints that will revisit locations pictured by Yoshida in the 1920s and 30s.",
