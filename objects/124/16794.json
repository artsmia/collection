  "text": "The prominent use of lantern motifs on this robe suggests that it was made to be worn during the lantern festival, celebrated during the middle of the first month of the lunar year. Nearly every Chinese family participated in lantern lighting, New Year’s vow taking, and lantern processions. Lanterns used in the decoration of chair covers, altar frontals, and outer coats likewise indicate that objects are to be used during the New Year festivities.",
