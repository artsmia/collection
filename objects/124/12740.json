  "text": "LEF was a group initiated by Vladimir Mayakovsky and Osip Brik late in 1922 as a publisher of books and journals. Not a Fellow Traveler was among its first publications; its text was first published in the LEF Journal in 1923 and in book form the same year.\r\n\r\nAnton Lavinsky's cover for the book was inspired by an idea of Mayakovsky. The bold lettering of the title is set at a diagonal paralleling the compositional format of the image of a speeding train.\r\n\r\nThe image was intended to demonstrate Brik's unwavering commitment to the Revolution in contrast to the uncertainty of a fellow traveler-a term invented by the militant Marxist Leon Trotsky to characterize writers who are not the artists of the proletarian revolution but its artistic fellow travelers.",
