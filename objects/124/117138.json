  "text": "Here, Aoki produced a work that is hung from the ceiling to hover slightly above the floor, which she believes suggests loneliness and anxiety. She cut polystyrene foam to a scale that accorded with the shape of her own body and then covered this core with layers of hemp cloth, polishing the outer layers to achieve a glossy, mirror-like surface. The upward extension is meant to suggest ceaseless pondering, while the red left leg renders the body at once beautiful and frightening.",
