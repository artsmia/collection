  "text": "While on a pilgrimage at Joshua Tree National Park, where she was “seeing [her] father through the end of his life, ” Cara Romero also considered the importance of the Joshua tree (known as tsawarümp (tsah-wah-ROOMP) in the Chemehuevi language). They appear as if animated within the landscape, in a photograph that also addresses the trees’ importance to the Chemehuevi. Romero is actively working to protect the trees, bringing into view their importance as “ancient spirit beings in our shared ancestral homelands of the California desert.”",
