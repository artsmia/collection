  "text": "For Kamoda, the early 1970s were a period of intense artistic activity and experimentation. No sooner would he receive acclaim for a new way of embellishing his vessels than he would move on to develop yet another approach. Here, he modified his wave patterns by carving them as overlapping scales. Though this jar is unglazed, he pigmented other works featuring the scale-like waves with colored glazes.",
