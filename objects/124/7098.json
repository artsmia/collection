As a showpiece, it was intended to forcefully demonstrate that French silverwork was beyond compare. Its strong sculptural form, immaculate surface and ivory accents epitomize the spirit and elegance, the very essence, of La Mode Parisian. It was made by Tétard Frères and retailed through Fouguet-Lapar of Paris.",
