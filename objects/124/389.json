  "text": "The Lung-ch'uan district in Chekiang province was an important center of celadon production from the Five Dynasties (907-960) through the Ming period (1368-1644). Celadon is merely a descriptive term applied to ceramic wares falling within a broad range of blue-green to gray-green colors. A chief glory of far eastern ceramics, celadon was eventually produced in Korea, Japan, Thailand and exported from China to India, Persia, Turkey, Egypt and Southeast Asia. Accordingly, a characteristic of many post-Sung Lung-ch'uan celadons is that they are large, heavily potted bowls and dishes such as this one, which could withstand the rigors of transit over great distances. This piece, exceptional in its scale and quality, typifies Ming taste in its opulent scrolled rim, incised floral decor and thick olive-green glaze.",
