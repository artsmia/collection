  "text": "The Hmong have long prized beautiful textiles, often made to mark special occasions. Here, within an appliquéd triangular border—which symbolizes the protective nature of the mountains—we see a “story cloth” depicting the clothing and customs of a Hmong New Year celebration. Such embroidered hangings and blankets represent a relatively new art form, developed in the mid-1970s in refugee camps as women found new markets for their traditional craft. In this vibrant panel we see activities ranging from harvesting and horse racing to feasting, highlighting the good fortune of the past year and signaling prosperity to come.",
