  "text": "This painting depicts people watching a hunt in Sendai in Tohoku province. It has been suggested that Rinkoku himself witnessed such scene on his travels. The phrase watching the hunt comes from a poem by Chinese poet Wang Wei (699-759), indicating Rinkoku's deep appreciation of Chinese culture. RInkoku outlines the mountain with simple lines then adds quick brush strokes and light colors to the mountains. Many people watch the hunting from the tops of the mountains. In the foreground, three men are about to catch an animal. According to the inscription, this is the moment when the leader of the hunt announces that the beast has been captured. Red flags fluttering in the blustery mountain heights intensify the drama of the scene.",
