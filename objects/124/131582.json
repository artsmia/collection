  "text": "Only royalty during the Ryūkyū Kingdom could wear bingata with yellow ground; after annexation by Japan in 1879, such restrictions were lifted. Still, these special garments were worn only for festive or ceremonial occasions. This garment has a kimono structure, visible in the detached sleeves and shorter, overlapping lapel. It has an intricate pattern of interconnected little flowers with accent colors in red, blue, and purple.",
