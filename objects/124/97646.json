  "text": "By the middle of the Warring States period (475â€“221 BCE), the finest tableware was lacquer. Thinly carved wooden objects were protected with several coats of lacquer, creating a light, durable vessel. This rare wine cup, with its crescent-shaped handles, has, remarkably, survived intact. It is displayed here with a gilt-bronze cup stand of the same period.",
