  "text": "Drescher's idiosyncratic artist's book is an intoxicating visual feast of riotous color, animated themes, and innovative designs. The Danish-born painter, illustrator, and author characterized the book's autobiographical content as a compilation of scars, tattoos, memories, impressions, flashback, forgotten instructions. \r\n\r\nGranary Books, an independent press and bookseller founded in Minneapolis, but which relocated to New York in 1989, published the book. Minneapolis printer and publisher Philip Gallo, who collaborated on many Granary projects over the years, printed the book.",
