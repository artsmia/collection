  "text": "In the summer of 2020, artists Cody Edison and Christine Wood initiated their Postcards for John project to honor the life of civil rights giant John Lewis, generate money for nonprofits, and support the U.S. Postal Service. For her contributions to the series, Eve-Lauryn LaFountain wove together strips of found film and scratched the words “You Are on Native Land” into the emulsion. For those who purchased her work, LaFountain researched the Indigenous histories of each recipient’s address and wrote a short narrative of the Indigenous peoples of that place. Here, the postcards acknowledge the original caretakers of the land where this exhibition takes place (the Dakota); the land where the artist lives in Santa Fe (the Tewa); and the land where the works were made in Los Angeles (the Tongva, Chumash, and Kizh).",
