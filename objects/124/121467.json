  "text": "Placing Jesus in a familiar domestic setting emphasized his humanity, and let Sebald Beham indulge the northern love of specificity. The tall cup held by the standing figure is a Stangenglass (pole glass), and the short cup on the table is a Krautstrunk (cabbage stalk). Other vessels chill in a basin. A repentant sinner nearby bathes Christ’s feet and dries them with her hair (Luke 7:36-50).",
