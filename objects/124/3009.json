The urn's stem outlines the faces of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette of France, and the willow trees profile their son the dauphin (left) and Madame Royale, the king's mother (upper right). This porcelain design was ordered by French émigrés in England after all four were executed in the French Revolution.",
