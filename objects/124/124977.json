  "text": "For each print in his “Black Dada” portfolio (Mia 2018.123.4.1-.14), German artist and musician Thomas Zipp began with an existing photograph of Otto Hahn, a German scientist whose research helped lead to the development of the atomic bomb. \r\n\r\nZipp altered Hahn’s portrait by introducing additional photographic images and some hand-drawn passages to create a deep web of associations regarding the social and political consequences of this historic scientific advancement. In ffw, which stands for “fast-forward,” X-ray photographs of radioactivity are superimposed over an image of Hahn.",
