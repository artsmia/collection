  "text": "Initially trained as an academic painter, Moret’s style evolved under the influence of Paul Gauguin and the Pont-Aven artists. The hatched brushstrokes of brilliant, pure color in <I>The Cove of Goulineau</I> evidence this influence. Gradually his landscape paintings became increasingly Impressionistic in their naturalism and concentration on transient light effects.",
