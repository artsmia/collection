  "text": "Initially trained as an academic painter, Moret’s style evolved under the influence of Paul Gauguin and the Pont-Aven artists. The hatched brushstrokes of brilliant, pure color in The Cove of Goulineau evidence this influence. Gradually his landscape paintings became increasingly Impressionistic in their naturalism and concentration on transient light effects.",
