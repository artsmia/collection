  "text": "Large, extensively decorated burial jars like this have been recovered in recent decades. Limited to the area south of the river in the Northern Zhejiang and Southern Jiangsu province, they represent a vessel type and burial practices specific to this region. Made without lids, the jars display an extremely rich assortment of molded figures, animals, and architecture in a tiered arrangement comprising their upper portions.\r\n<P>The jars were most likely placed in the tomb so the soul of the deceased would have a place to reside. This accounts for a palace-like structure with entrance gates facing the four directions. The various figures at the top most likely represent Daoist immortals who somehow aided in the afterlife.",
