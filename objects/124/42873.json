  "text": "Reginald Marsh's fascination with Coney Island extended to its amusement area with its merry-go-rounds, roller coasters and sideshows. In 1940 Marsh studied engraving with British printmaker Stanley William Hayter (1901-1988). The nervous line so suited to Marsh's earlier dancehalls and burlesques now became more angular and elegant. The diagonal, elongated central figure and surging horses show the influence of the Baroque compositions Marsh had seen at the Louvre Museum.",
