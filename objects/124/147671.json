  "text": "Aminah Robinson routinely chose themes and subjects drawn from Black culture and experience. In this watercolor and collage from 1989, Robinson alludes to the tradition of formerly enslaved Africans and their decendants engaged in entrepreneurial trades and pursuits as means of survival. Here, Robinson depicts a architypcial &quot;Pepper Pot Woman, &quot; who from colonial times until the late 1940s, sold hot pepper soup from a pushcart on the streets of Philadelphia. In handwritten text Robinson inserted across the top of the drawing, she notes that early street vendors like the Philadelphia pepper pot woman, represented the historical origins of African American cooking.",
