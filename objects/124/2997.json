  "text": "In Bhutanese homes large, firm cushions or low box-frame couches provide comfortable places to take one's rest. Colorful textiles called <I>denkheb</I> function as a type of mattress cover that both protects and embellishes the sleeping surface. The most prestigious form of <I>denkheb</I> originates in central Bhutan and consists of two panels of <I>yathra</I> cloth stitched together lengthwise. \r\n\r\n<I>Yathra</I> cloth is a heavy, woolen fabric that features wide bands of weft patterns alternating with colorful stripes. During the reign of Bhutan's second king (1926-52), however, a new style of yathra cloth became fashionable that imitated the designs used in Tibetan rugs. Small, geometric designs cover the surface of the cloth, and the piece is unified with a meander border the encloses the patterning.",
