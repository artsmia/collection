The Buckingham Vase, a 46-inch high marble urn acquired by the first Marquess of Buckingham, was portayed in engravings published by  Italian artist Giovanni Battista Piranesi.  While not exact copies of the original vase, the wine coolers retain the classical urn shape and feature the same cavorting Erotes (winged gods of love) cavorting among twining grape vines and leaves.",
