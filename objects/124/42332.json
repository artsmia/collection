  "text": "Dating back to the thirteen century, the night fair at Sakai Beach in Osaka is held in late summer. It follows a ritual in which local fishermen offer their catch of the day to Sumiyoshi, the god of the sea, at a nearby shrine.  After praying for a bountiful season and safety at sea, the fishermen auction off the fish used as offerings to raise money for the shrine.  The fair attracts as many spectators as buyers, who enjoy watching the spirited bidding. The design of this print well conveys the liveliness of the festivity that marks the end of summer and thus serves as an appropriate image to accompany poems that evoke the arrival of autumn.",
