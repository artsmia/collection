  "provenance": "Church of San Marco, Florence (high altar, from c. 1440; moved to hallway to the sacristy, by 1758; dispersed in 19th century).[1] ? Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington (d. 1852), London (given to Peregrine?); Dr. Thomas Peregrine, London [2]; by descent to his grandson, E. F. Peregrine, Wellington, Shropshire, England (until 1960, sale, Sotheby's, London, June 22, 1960, no. 10, as St. Benedict, for £9, 500 GBP, to Put); Put collection, England (from 1960). Dr. Heinemann, New York.[3] Walter Bareiss, New York; [Richard H. Zinser acting for Bareiss, Forest Hills, New York, 1962; sold to Mia] \r\nNOTES\r\n[1] This work was part of a polyptych intended for the high altar at San Marco, which was disassembled in the 19th century. Several of the dispersed panels are in museums, including the Museo di San Marco, Art Institute of Chicago, National Gallery of Art, Washington D.C. Fra Angelico's altarpiece is recorded in the hallway to the sacristy by Giuseppe Richa, Notizie istoriche delle chiese fiorentine (Florence 1758), vol. 7, p. 123.   \r\n\r\n[2] Sotheby's 1960 sale catalogue states it came from the collection of Dr. Thomas Peregrine, physician of the Duke of Wellington and descended to Peregrine's grandson. Ellis Waterhouse (1979 letter) refutes this, stating there is no possible way the painting was in the Wellington collection.\r\n\r\n[3] Note in curatorial file indicates a verbal communication from John Pope-Hennessy, confirming this ownership.",

  "text": "Saint Romuald, born in 950, founded the strict Camaldolese order of monks who valued austerity and meditation. His white robe shows that his order was a reformed movement of  the better-known Benedictines, and his book and staff, made from reeds, speak to his wisdom and commitment to living simply. The fine details of his expression and subtle shadows on his robe are hallmarks of the painter Fra Angelico, who was himself a devout friar.",
