  "text": "During the Han dynasty, food became both abundant and varied. Even the common people enjoyed great improvements in their standard of living. Han tombs nearly always included storage jars (<I>hu</I>) full of cereals and wine for the afterlife. This large, lidded jar painted in red, white and purple pigments with spiral patterns can be seen as a less expensive substitute for the similarly decorated lacquer containers that likely inspired its decor.",
