  "text": "Larry Bell’s provocative series of screenprints are based on photographs of nude female models he made in the late 1960s using a motorized panoramic camera that shoots in 360 degrees. The open shutter of the moving camera coupled with the motion of the women resulted in distorted photographic stills that resemble the effect of looking into a fun-house mirror. The garish pink color and cheesy flocking enhance the “sixties psychedelic” feel of the prints, something Bell intended to emphasize. “I smoked a lot of pot and did some acid in my younger days,” explains Bell, “and when I saw the 1970 film Performance with Mick Jagger it reminded me of the images I was working on. I thought they would make good posters for the culture that liked that kind of stuff. On a more serious note, the images demonstrate Bell’s longstanding interest in exploring the nature of visual and mental perception.",
