This pitcher was designed for the Boucheron line in the 1900 Exposition Universelle de Paris. The artist won the gold medal for his commissioned designs including this exceptional work. It provides surface for naturaliste elements -- a lizard and a bumble bee -- as well as suggesting in form a seed pod or plant husk.",
