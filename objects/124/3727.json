  "text": "Intended as an experiment, few of these chairs were ever produced.  The back and seat consist of a single bent plywood panel, the front edge covered with a protective rod to prevent the edge from being broken.  A second plywood pane, its edge similarly protected, serves as a rear support that can be locked at two different heights.  It is reinforced by a third, thicker piece of plywood which is braced between the seat and the rod in back.  Because the material is relatively weak, it is doubtful whether Thaden's construction could have withstood normal daily use.  Even so, its aesthetic appeal is undeniable.",
