  "text": "During the Ming and Qing period, the production of cultural accoutrements rose along with literati culture. The objects for scholars’ desks were increasingly produced in various materials. Although the religious connotation had weakened, dragons were still largely auspicious motifs, as in this case. The two dragons here are fighting. Their sinuous bodies form the shape of a brush rest, where a scholar could place his brush when not in use.",
