  "text": "A ritual staff, or <i>khatamka</i> (<i>khaṭvāṅga</i> in Sanskrit), is held in the crook of the left arm of Vajrayana Buddhist practitioners during ceremonies. It symbolizes the triumph of wisdom over illusion. The shaft is topped by a <i>vajra</i>, the thunderbolt of instant enlightenment. Below are three impaled heads in varying states of decay: a skull, or “dry” head, signals the conquest of ignorance; the “damp” head signals the victory over hate; and the “fresh-cut” head signals the stopping of desire. The arrangement also symbolizes the life cycle and the attainment of pure body, speech, and mind. Below the three heads is a <i>vajra</i>-cross, representing the four purified elements: earth, water, fire, and air.",
