  "text": "This is a typical stacked food box (jūbako) as it has been used for presentation especially at important occasions like new year’s celebrations. Each compartment is of equal height and interchangeable if there wouldn’t be a continuous design on the outside. In this case, all four sides as well as the lid are decorated with stylized streams of water and autumnal elements of persimmons, pumpkins, chestnuts, and all kinds of leaves.",
