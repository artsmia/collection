  "text": "poem by Zhang Xiaobiao 章孝標 (fl. c. 830)\r\n\r\nThe branches of a plum tree loaded with embroidered or tie-dyed blossoms of red, gold, and black dominate both the front and back of this <i>kosode</i>, a type of robe with narrow sleeve openings. The seven Chinese characters that float across the upper part of the robe can be read from the back of the right sleeve, moving left across the back, then picking up on the front of the left sleeve, and moving left across the chest: “Plum blossoms swathed in snow flutter over the zither.” This is the first line of a well-known couplet by the Tang-dynasty Chinese poet Zhang Xiaobiao (mid-9th c.) that describes an outdoor gathering in early spring.",
