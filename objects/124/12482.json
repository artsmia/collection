  "text": "Raku tea bowls were first created by Chōjirō (d.1589), a maker of earthenware tiles, under the direction of the great tea master Sen no Rikyū (1522–1591). The light clay, thick black or red glaze, and hand-built forms combined to suggest the simplicity and rustic quality desired by Rikyū. The slightly exaggerated surface treatment of this bowl, as well as the roughly incised image of a fisherman trolling his boat, suggests that it was created later in the Edo period when tea enthusiasts and potters began to venture beyond the conservative and somber <I>wabi</I> aesthetic preferred by Rikyū.",
