  "text": "Picasso discovered the arts of antiquity as a young man visiting the Louvre, and in 1917 he traveled to Italy for the first time. Afterward, he began to create paintings, drawings, and pottery inspired by works from the ancient Mediterranean world and incorporating themes from Greek and Roman mythology. This woman’s serene expression, languid pose, and draped dress reflect classical influences, but she sits alone, without any clear setting or narrative.",
