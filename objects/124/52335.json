  "text": "Inspired from life and his own fertile imagination, Domenico Tiepolo etched 24 scenes of the Flight into Egypt. Their romantic and pastoral landscapes are indebted to the paintings and prints of Venetian artists such as Marco Ricci (1676-1730) and Canaletto (1697-1768). In the spirit of Venice, Domenico also created several scenes that depict the Holy Family traveling in a small boat, fancifully steered by an angelic gondolier. Further, his vibrant treatment of the scenes, with sparkling waters and vast skies, is particularly Venetian.",
