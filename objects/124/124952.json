  "text": "Georg Baselitz was a prominent painter, sculptor, and printmaker in postwar Germany. He rejected gestural abstraction, which dominated avant-garde painting during the 1950s and early 1960s, in favor of a distinctive style modeled after the figurative motifs of German expressionist painters and printmakers, who had helped cultivate modernism in Europe. In his two-dimensional work, Baselitz emphasized the inherent surface and textural properties of his chosen medium—woodcut, in this example—which allowed his works to function both as objects and images. Published in four variant color schemes, Baselitz’s “Remix” woodcuts are meditations on time, memory, failure, and possibilities. His subjects, fleeting and fragmentary, blend abstracted figures and objects drawn from his personal experiences growing up in communist-controlled East Germany.",
