  "text": "Moki Cherry made painting, posters, sculpture and fiber art within a family and extended community dedicated to music and performance. She often made work to accompany music or to be featured as the visual gateway for music, especialy for her partner, the innovative jazz trumpeter Don Cherry. Moki's painting is filled with the forms and imagery that originated in her visions but also coincide with the development of Don Cherry's free improvised music and incorporation of many musical world traditions. The paintings show that same sensibility and integration while being free.",
