  "text": "The temple complex of Cambodia’s Angkor Wat, originally built in 1150 CE, has been a site of fascination for many. Its stone structures stand as a testament to Cambodia’s long and complex history, ranging from its Hindu and Buddhist practices, as well as to the splendor of the site of the ancient Khmer capital of Angkor. Kenro Izu’s photographs carefully depict the complex, ranging from details to broader views. Whether through the delicate bas-reliefs to the trunks of trees emerging from passageways, Izu’s photographs bring us closer to the artistry behind each temple.",
