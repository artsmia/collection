  "text": "Jubilee’s stripes are deceptively simple. Many were created from a variety of woven braids introduced into the warp sequence, necessitating alterations that resulted in slowing down power loom production. Beginning in the early 1950s, Dick Bolan was the first power weaver to work with the Larsen company. Over the years, Bolan’s engineering skills were tested again and again in order to accommodate Larsen designers’ special concepts.",
