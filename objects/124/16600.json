  "text": "During the Qing Dynasty, men played both male and female roles in plays and operas. Stage decoration and scenery were kept to a minimum, so the audienceâ€™s attention needed to be captured by dramatic, exaggerated costumes and stage makeup to ensure the characters were recognizable. This robe would almost certainly have been over-the-top as everyday wear, but on stage its bright pink color and butterfly design were necessary for dramatic effect.",
