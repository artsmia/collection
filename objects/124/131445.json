  "text": "Toyokuni's Drawings: A Magic Contest features kabuki actors juxtaposed to people, good or evil, that have supernatural powers. The motifs derive from popular legends, kabuki plays, or adventure novels that were well-liked in the mid-19th century. As this series was one-of-a-kind each print was published on thick paper with expensive pigments and special printing features like embossing and lacquer printing.",
