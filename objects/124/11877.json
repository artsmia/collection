  "text": "The Age of Enlightenment venerated its “Grands Hommes” (Great Men). These were not rulers and religious figures as in the past, but writers, scientists, philosophers, artists, and statesmen—public intellectuals—celebrated for their ideas, character, and virtue. In France, the portraits of grands hommes proliferated, in newspaper and print, in marble portraits and oil paintings at the Salon, and in newly erected monuments in the Pantheon. Capitalizing on this trend, wax artists and miniaturists produced portraits and dioramas of famous figures for displays in their Paris shops.  Voltaire, Franklin, and Rousseau were frequently grouped together as “Fathers of the French Revolution” (see Mia 23.117 and 23.119). Their progressive beliefs on liberty, equality, separation of church and state, tolerance, and other issues had laid the foundation for the era's radical changes.\r\n\r\nVoltaire (1694-1778), a generation older than his fellow philosophers Franklin and Rousseau (Mia 23.117 and 23.119), wears the more formal dress of the ancien regime, with a wig, long embroidered coat, and silk stockings. The essayist, playwright, and satirist was controversial and world-famous for his polemical critiques of royalty, the Church, government, and so much more. He is depicted composing a missive on justice, and a two-volume compendium of his writings sits on his desk. Voltaire was prolific: the 1775 complete edition of his writings numbered 40 tomes, and 15, 000 of the estimated 40, 000 letter he wrote survive today. \r\n\r\nIdentical versions of Mia's Franklin and Voltaire portraits in Warsaw were attributed to Philippe Curtius (1737-1794), a physician and artist who trained Madame Tussaud in the art of wax modeling. His cabinets of wax works in Paris drew large crowds in the 1770s and 1780s. But he is not known to have worked in plaster, making it more likely that this group was made by a contemporary in his circle.",
