  "text": "Clarence K. Bros, who spent his entire life in Minneapolis, was an active member of the Minneapolis Camera Club, a local group of photographers. He also worked as a building contractor, and many of his images include architectural elements from private homes, public buildings, and world’s fair pavilions. His interest in pictorialism, an aesthetic style of photography characterized by its painterly quality and lack of sharp focus, might at first seem contradictory to modernist abstraction, but when combined with nontraditional angles and close cropping as in Light Pattern, it became a unique approach for capturing the effects of light and shadow.",
