  "text": "Furukawa’s work is characterized by asymmetrical yet harmonious compositions, often featuring irregular bands\n\nof alternating solid colors enlivened with subtle decorative motifs. Her fluid, delicate brushwork and sensitive\n\nuse of color create a lyrical counterpoint to the angular, functional forms of her ceramics, with her designs\nflowing seamlessly across every surface of the vessel. This rectangular platter with slightly curved edges, is\n\ndecorated with red grasses over a white field.",
