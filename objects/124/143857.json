  "text": "Libertà al Cile (Freedom for Chile) was a weekly publication that appeared five times during the 1974 Biennale di Venezia, on Oct. 5, 12, 19, and 26, and November 2, and was composed and edited by Chilean journalists and scholars.  Included in each issue was a poster created by artists Diego Birelli, Roberto Sebastian Matta, Emilio Vedova, Giò Pomodoro and Andrea Cascella, respectively. The purpose of the publication was to express solidarity with the plight of Chile and its people under the miulitary junta of Augusto Pinochet (1915-2006), who in 1973 led the violent overthrowing of the democratically-elected President Salvador Allende (1908-1973). The project was directed by Carlo Ripa di Meana, president of the Biennale di Venezià.",
