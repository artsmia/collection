  "text": "The subtle, low-relief carvings of leafy vegetation on the sides of the vase conspire with the light-green ridges framing them to accentuate the verticality of the vase. William H. Grueby’s rich, matte green glaze was a leading innovation in the ceramic world in the late 1800s. The understated hue quietly evokes nature indoors while successfully representing a leafy surface.",
