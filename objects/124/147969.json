  "text": "This book contains a haunting series of seven woodcuts reflecting Ernst Barlach’s spiritual crisis in the wake of World War I and the death of his mother. Stripping traditional Christian imagery of triumph, Barlach presents God as broken, grotesque, or absent—appearing as a beggar, a corpse, or a distorted idol. With bold, expressive carving, these prints confront themes of suffering, alienation, and the search for meaning. Created during the fragile years of the Weimar Republic, &quot;Die Wandlungen Gottes&quot; invites viewers to grapple with divinity not as certainty, but as struggle—a deeply human force shaped by loss, doubt, and transformation.",
