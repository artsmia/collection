  "text": "The Big Ben is a classic Dreyfuss design, a stylish reworking of an inexpensive alarm clock by creating a smooth rounded shell and tapering base, and removing the bells from the top of the clock.  Although Dreyfuss began redesigning the clock in the early 1930s, by 1939, when this one was made, the Big Ben had reached its elegant height. It is the Big Ben Loud Alarm clock, described as an alarm for the heavy sleeper. The clock came in a box with strong linear graphics, also designed by Dreyfuss's firm, as an integral part of marketing the clock.",
