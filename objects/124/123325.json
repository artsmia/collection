  "text": "This double-weave coverlet comprises two layers of interwoven cloth. Its complex weave structure required the use of a newly developed machine—the French-invented Jacquard loom, now regarded as a precursor to the modern computer. This coverlet was made in Bergen County, New Jersey, for Sarah Durie, whose name has been woven into the design. When Western European weavers emigrated to the United States, they brought design preferences with them, and pockets of regionally distinct coverlet styles soon developed. The three-leaved rose woven into the four corners of this coverlet may indicate it was made by I. Christie, who worked in the tradition of master weaver David Daniel Haring.",
