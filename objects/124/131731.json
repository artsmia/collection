  "text": "Okinawan textiles sometimes incorporated design motifs from mainland Japan, a tradition that probably grew out of the maritime trade. Here, stylized depictions of pine, bamboo, and plum blossoms are arranged in a circle. Together they make a common motif in the arts of Japan, known as the “Three Friends of Winter” (shōchikubai), which symbolizes longevity, perseverance, and renewal. Both symbols of longevity, a crane and a tortoise decorate the center, thus suggesting that this uchikui was used to cover or wrap gifts for ceremonies such as weddings.",
