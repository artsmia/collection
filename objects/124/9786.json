  "text": "This round <I>tzu-t'an</I> tube with its screw-on fu-dog top could have been used to store exotic incense sticks, a favorite writing brush, special chopsticks, or more likely cricket-tickling sticks. Unfortunately, the long, carefully inlaid inscription provides no clue as to the container's exact purpose. It reads in part:\r\n\r\n<P><I>In the distance is a misty grove -- viewing the spring colors in Chiang-nan\r\n<P>Everything here is worth remembering.\r\n<P>The sorrows of rivers and mountains have not been thoroughly tasted...\r\n<P>In the sunset under the willow trees, in whose courtyard am I in tying up the      <P>horse's reigns?</I>\r\n\r\n<P>It is signed Tsun-chiang <I>mo-ku</I> (in imitation of the ancient) with a cyclical date of <I>keng-hsu</I> corresponding to either 1670 or 1730. While very few inlayers of wood are recorded, silver-wire inlay is a characteristically Chinese art practice. This exquisitely crafted tube is a rare signed and dated literati object, however, and is thought to be unique.",
