  "text": "With vases such as this, English potteries copied the height of French Rococo style—so called because the ornament suggests broken shells or rockwork (rocaille in French). In the most extreme examples, the decoration dictated the vessel’s shape. You can see that happening here. Constructed from molded leaf forms that sweep up and down, the asymmetrical vase seems almost to be moving or swaying in the breeze.",
