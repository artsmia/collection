  "text": "Trained as a painter and sculptor, Claire Zeisler became interested in woven structures in the 1950s. She created sculpture from a variety of fibers—jute, sisal, raffia, silk, wool—and in the mid‑1970s began working with leather. Leather did not require weaving, knotting, or joining but could instead be cut and folded. This piece consists of a freestanding metal armature supporting hundreds of strips of cut leather that cascade in a shifting series of red and gray planes.",
