  "text": "The term Yueh is associated with a large body of celadon-glazed stoneware produced from the Eastern Han dynasty (25-220) into the Song (thirteenth century) in numerous kilns in northern Chekiang and southern Jiangsu provinces. An important form of early celadon, it's high-fired glazes were refined over the centuries but, around 1200 the production of Chekiang Yueh ware came to an end. This elegant wine ewer, retaining its original lid, represents the end of the long and venerable tradition of Yueh ware celadon production.",
