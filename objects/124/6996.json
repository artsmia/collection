  "text": "Possessing the genius and skills to render a seemingly crude medium -- ironwork -- with a sense of grace and dignity, Brandt's supremacy in the field of ironsmithing stems from his innate feel for materials and a rigorous discipline. Unlike many other ironworkers of his time, Brandt understood the delicate balance between the monumental and the decorative, carefully balancing these two elements with considerable style. This fireplace screen is one of his many designs featuring a stylized fountain motif. Representing the eternal source of life, it became a favorite Art Deco theme in the '20s.",
