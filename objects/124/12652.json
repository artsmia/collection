  "text": "The stalls are from the chancel of a Gothic church at Olmedo, Spain (in the northern province of Valladolid). They were intended for the canons of the church. The arms are those of Manrique, counts of Osorno. The rich patterns in the panels present delightful expressions of Gothic design, clearly derived from the pointed arches of the windows of the period, with their flamboyant tracery. The carner purposely left the mark of each cut of chisel or gouge, thes giving to the surface and lines the charm of varied light.",
