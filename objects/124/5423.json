  "text": "Moses Kimball, a dry-goods merchant in Newburyport, Massachusetts, was a typical sitter for William Jennys, an itinerant portrait painter who traveled around New England depicting members of the merchant class. Jennys, born in Boston, trained with his father, also a portraitist. His style is characterized by a realistic rendering and heavy shading of the sitter's face.\r\n\r\nConservation of this painting was made possible by a generous contribution through the Art Champions program in honor of Sam and Patty McCullough.",
