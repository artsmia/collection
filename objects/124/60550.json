  "text": "With renewed antiquarian studies during the Northern Song dynasty (960-1127), ancient bronze shapes including Ding tripods began to be appropriated as incense burners. Furthermore, new censers in bronze and glazed ceramic, were now commissioned in the ancient styles.\r\n<P>Appearing black, the dark-brown glaze covering the interior and exterior of this cauldron is suffused throughout with silvery oil-spot markings. The oil-spot effect was achieved by the application of iron-rich solutions to the glaze in a way that resulted in super-saturated iron compounds collecting into the desired silvery spots.\r\n<P>This rare oil-spot censer is apparently unique. Technical characteristics indicate that it probably comes from kilns near Zibo in Shandong province. Its dating has been confirmed with a thermoluminescent test.",
