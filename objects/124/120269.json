  "text": "Portraiture and figurative art are fundamental to Jim Dine’s printmaking practice. A consummate draftsman and etcher, Dine is adept at interpreting his subject’s physicality, emotions, and state of mind in highly expressive portrayals that frequently retain a mysterious ambiguity. In the present example, Dine captures an otherwise unidentified Asian woman in a private moment of anguish. Seated alone with eyes closed, the woman has turned inward with her feelings, as the viewer is left to speculate as to the source of her grief.",
