  "text": "<p>Jimi Hendrix was an American icon of the Rock era. His trailblazing guitar work led the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame to call him “arguably the greatest instrumentalist in the history of rock music.” In 1969, his rendition of the “Star-Spangled Banner” at the Woodstock music festival became a symbol of America’s Vietnam War culture clash. He died of a drug overdose at age 27. </p><p>Patrick Procktor similarly had tremendous youthful success. He was at the center of the gay artistic scene of 1960s London and became known especially for his brilliance as a watercolorist. In this memorial portrait of Hendrix, Procktor perfectly balanced freedom and control—the loft of the musician’s hair in contrast with the sharp contour of his cheek, the black military jacket setting off the bright and frilly shirt.\n</p>",
