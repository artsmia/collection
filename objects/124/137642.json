  "text": "Traditional Zulu earthenware vessels function as potent connectors between ancestors and the living. Most are made for either brewing or serving mild beer, which is communally consumed at important occasions. Even though Zulu potters work within a traditional artistic canon of process, form, and surface treatment, there is considerable opportunity for individual expression. Indeed, distinguishing’s one’s pottery is a primary vehicle for women to assert and increase their prestige within Zulu society. Mncane Nzuza’s pots, remarkably accomplished both technically and aesthetically, are a testament to this dynamic.",
