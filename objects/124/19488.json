  "text": "This type of chair was widely popular in the Delaware Valley from the 1730s through the 1850s.  The design is actually a blend of New England and Germanic furniture traditions formed through the simultaneous immigration of Germans.  The turned and tapered front and back legs with cone shaped feet are found on rural German chairs while the turned ring-and-urn shaped front stretcher is a variation found on Boston and eastern Massachusetts chairs.",
