  "text": "Hamada Shōji was a major figure in the mingei (folk art) movement that originated in the 1920s. After extensive travels to Okinawa, Korea, China, and Europe, he settled in Mashiko, north of Tokyo, where he decided to use only local materials. His works are inspired by the folk-craft techniques and simplicity he admired in the works he saw in his travels.",
