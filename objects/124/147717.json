  "text": "David L. Parker first became interested in photographing leprosy patients through his interest in child labor. As he recalled in a 2024, while visiting Kathmandu he was staying close to a hospital that treated Hansen’s Disease patients. He was invited to come in and was granted permission to photograph at the hospital. Since then, he has visited at least four times, further expanding his documentation of the patients and their treatment. Here, he presents a patient at the Anandaban Hospital, considered by some a refuge for those recovering from Hansen’s who are often stigmatized for their condition.",
