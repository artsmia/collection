  "text": "Minimalist painter, sculptor, and printmaker Robert Mangold rose to prominence in the 1960s with the exhibition of highly restrained geometric paintings and constructivist-influenced sculpture. Mangold's work typically centers on the relationships between time, space, and motion, but also explores purely formal concerns, particularly asymmetry and the interaction of image and ground in sequential or progressive arrangements of forms. His two-dimensional abstractions commonly exhibit a sense of architectural construction, appearing more as objects in space than as images. Mangold produced this accordion-fold portfolio of screenprints as both a record and reiteration of a series of geometric panel paintings he completed in the mid 1970s.",
