  "text": "A leading figure of the Ming-dynasty Wu School, Wen Zhengming united poetry, painting, and calligraphy as expressions of cultivated life. Here, he records waking from a summer nap, savoring cool shade, a Duan inkstone, and fragrant Guzhu tea. The flowing running script reflects calm introspection, its rhythm echoing the poem’s unhurried mood. Wen’s refined brushwork and spacious composition embody the literati ideal of withdrawal from court life into scholarship, friendship, and quiet self-cultivation—values that shaped Chinese artistic identity for centuries.",
