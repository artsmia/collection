  "text": "Francis Seymour Haden’s vantage point is in the town of Putney. He looks north across the River Thames to Fulham. In 1859, Fulham was still a suburb of London, but real estate developers and speculators saw its potential. Today, it lies near the center of Greater London. The massive tower toward the right was built in the 1400s as part of All Saints, the ancient parish church of Fulham.",
