  "text": "This tiny woodcut stands in for countless small, crudely made prints that were nevertheless treasured for their depictions of religious subjects. Since such prints are vanishingly rare today, we lack complete understanding of their use. Most were probably glued into or onto prayer books, boxes for keepsakes, and other personal possessions, where they could help the faithful visualize the subjects of their prayers.",
