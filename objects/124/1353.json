  "text": "Harlequin is a character in the Commedia dell’arte, a form of Italian theater in which masked actors perform broad, humorous sketches. Most figures in commedia are based on social stereotypes of 1500s Italy. Harlequin is a mischievous servant dressed in a diamond-patterned costume who vies against the clown character Pierrot for the love of Colombina, a servant girl.\r\n\r\nGris and other modern artists—including Picasso—commonly used Harlequin and other Commedia dell’arte figures as subject matter. The layered meanings of Harlequin fit well with the Cubist configuration of the figure from different viewpoints, where no one fixed perspective is shown.\r\n\r\nConservation of this picture was made possible by a generous contribution from Al and Dena Naylor through the Art Champions program.",
