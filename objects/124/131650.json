  "text": "A sodenashi is a sleeveless jacket designed to leave the wearer’s arms free while working or to provide additional padding when carrying loads on the back. They were common among the working class, as much a piece of equipment as a garment. The weft of this one is of a particularly fine koyori, a handspun mulberry-paper cordage, whose long fibers give it strength. The warp is of handspun cotton thread. The fabric features vertical stripes dyed with various shades of indigo, showing the wide range of blues, from nearly black to slightly green, that can be achieved with this natural dye.",
