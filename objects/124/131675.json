  "text": "Technique: Double ikat (tate-yoko gasuri)\r\nThis is an example of a mihonchō, or sample book, that shows variations of textile patterns. In urban areas, cloth merchants kept sample books to show potential customers available patterns. In rural areas they also served as a record of the work of individual weavers, from whom merchants ordered cloth. The collection contains rectangular swatches of cotton featuring various patterns woven with resist-dyed threads on both the warp and weft, known as tate-yoko gasuri (double ikat). Double ikat is an extremely complex technique, requiring exacting eyes and hands of both dyer and weaver. This sample is likely a specific variable of kasuri called Yamato-gasuri, which was made in the Yamato area within Nara Prefecture.",
