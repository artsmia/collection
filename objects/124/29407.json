  "text": "Rebecca Cauman was a member of the Society of Arts and Crafts in Boston, where she achieved Master Craftsman status in 1924. She created this unusual pair of hand-hammered bookends featuring stylized orange trees by using metal foil and enamel in a medley of bright colors. Her images recall children's book illustrations, which were much in favor with artists during the Arts and Crafts movement. From 1928 into the 1940s, Cauman and her sister ran a retail shop on Madison Avenue in New York. It featured handcrafted silver, pewter, and copper objects, including her own designs, for which she received national and international recognition.",
