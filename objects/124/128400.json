  "text": "The Sloop Inn was the artist hangout in St. Ives, an English fishing village that became a popular artist colony in the 1880s. The pub even let artists use its walls as a gallery. Sydney Lee, a regular visitor to St. Ives, gave us an unusual take on this watering hole. Instead of showing the interior filled with people, we see the building in the moonlight, its clientele long since in bed. This place could be any building in an English village.",
