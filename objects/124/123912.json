  "text": "The title of Tom Huck’s print—Scuds—refers to a type of tactical ballistic missile developed by the Soviet Union during the Cold War after a design originally conceived by the Nazis. Notoriously inaccurate, scuds served mainly as terror weapons. In Huck’s satirical presentation, an assortment of scuds soar through an interplanetary soup of communication satellites and comically oddball characters that includes a mitre-crowned cleric, a one-eyed astronaut, a gun-toting cowboy, several female nudes, and the prominent figure of Death. Each pilots a missile as it streaks toward its earth-bound target. In the scene’s dark absurdity, Huck exposes the folly of modern warfare.",
