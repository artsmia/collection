  "text": "Kondō Takahiro was born into a family of traditional blue-and-white porcelain artists. Takahiro, however, has not been stymied by the weight of his family's past accomplishments. While still working with porcelain and cobalt, he has established his own reputation by creating works that he coats with “silver mist, ” a metallic amalgam of silver, gold, and platinum. In the final firing, this amalgam beads up on the surface, creating thousands of shiny droplets against the underlying color.",
