  "text": "In this sculpture by Native artist Douglas Hyde, a woman stands beside cacti alongside a road with her thumb pointed up, needing to catch a ride into town. The figure is one frequently seen within the Navajo nation, elder women dressed in their very best traditional Navajo attire, including a long velveteen skirt, belted tunic, and squash blossom necklace, and their hair in a tsii-yeel, or bun. The woman is Going North to Shiprock, as the title suggests, to likely visit relatives and participate in activities, including the annual Shiprock Fair.",
