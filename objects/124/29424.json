  "text": "This circular box was used to contain seal paste, an essential element in Chinese calligraphy and painting for stamping personal or official seals. The lid depicts an elegant lady seated in a garden beneath a tree, evoking serenity and poetic reflection. The delicate blue painting contrasts with the subtly beaded white surface, showcasing refined craftsmanship. Such boxes combined utility with beauty, reflecting the harmony of art, intellect, and daily life. Their graceful designs appealed to scholars and collectors who valued refinement in both aesthetic taste and practical objects.",
