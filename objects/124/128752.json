  "text": "This miniature landscape is by an artist know known only by his initials, N.T, whom we think worked in Italy during the 1700s. Its size and horizontal format suggest that it may have been intended as a decoration in a book, possibly of pastoral stories or poetry. In any case it manages to evoke in a small space the grandeur that one would encounter by traversing the Italian countryside on foot.",
