  "text": "<I>Conquistador</I>, introduced as part of the 1967 Andean Collection, was particularly successful and soon became one of the signature cloths of the company.  In a note in the company archive Larsen writes that “<I>Conquistador</I> is my concept of how an Inca might handle a baroque motif.  That is, flatly and without the robust movement typical in Europe. More like the stone walls of Peru.” For some of the colorways the cloth was dyed twice for a contrapuntal vibration of close value colors such as bronze and amethyst, or amber and brown to suggest a tortoise shell.  The Spanish Colonial motif was scaled to fit upholstery cushioning and the total impact is one of great antiquitiy. <P>\r\nIn addition to the initial four colorways (wild honey, tortoise, crimson and bronzed amethyst) Topaz, Blue Blood and Pigeon Blood were added at a later date.  In 1977 Wild Honey was discontinued, but Tortoise and Pigeon Blood remained in production until 1985 when the company ceased batik production.",
