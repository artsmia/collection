  "text": "In Japan, firefighters were lionized as protectors of the city and its residents, and audiences never tired of dramatic portrayals of firefighters and their adventures. These are the rightmost two sheets of a set of seven portraying Kabuki actors dressed as firemen. Their exposed arms show tattoos, popular among firemen during the Edo period (1603–1868). In the background are standards (matoi), a form of placard, representing the various brigades that protected the city of Edo, today’s Tokyo. On the left is Mo portrayed by the actor Bandō Hikosaburō V (1832–1877), and on the right Se by Nakamura Shikan IV (1830–1899).",
