  "text": "This is a study for the head of Truth in the large painting Time Discovering Truth on the ceiling of the Palazzo Barbarigo in Venice painted in 1744-45. Giambattista Tiepolo was, along with Caneletto and Francesco Guardi, one of the leading Venetian painters of the era, and among them he was the only one to paint works of enormous scale. He was a versatile draftsman, able in various media. He often used black and white chalk on blue paper to work out the details of his compositions.",
