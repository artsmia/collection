  "text": "In the early 1990s NUNO designers began to experiment with velvet fabrics.  Traditionally a fabric associated with smooth, controlled elegance, Reiko Sudo and her team wanted to expand on the fabric's emotional message.  By cutting the pile unevenly and heat setting the surface in a counter-grain texture the resulting fabric communicates a somewhat edgy, 'let it happen' message.",
