  "text": "These two porringers demonstrate how little this form changed over half a century in New York. Shallow dishes or cups meant for everyday use, porringers commonly held foods such as soup or porridge. Typically, the body of a porringer would be raised and the handle would be cast and soldered on. Many times, molds for popular elements such as handles or spouts were shared among silversmith shops. For example, a Myer Myers porringer with a handle similar to the Parisien porringer (shown here at right) is currently on view in the exhibition A Handsome Cupboard of Plate in the Cargill Gallery, first floor.",
