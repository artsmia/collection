  "text": "At the turn of the 20th century, French ceramists working in the eastern city of Nancy adopted the naturalistic idiom which they faithfully rendered in a wide variety of media. Ernest Bussière studied at the Ecole des Beaux Arts, first in Nancy and then Paris, before returning to Nancy as a modeling instructor.\r\n\r\nWorking with the Lunèville ceramic firm of Keller and Guérin, Bussière produced a series of vases with organic forms in metal-tinted stoneware, first exhibited in the grand 1900 Paris Universal Exposition. Inspired by his surrounding countryside, Bussière applied motifs of local foliage to his highly sculptural forms. This iridescent pitcher is clothed in a naturalism that subtly disguises its function as a pouring vessel.",
