  "text": "Layport took up woodworking after spending forty years in advertising.  In the 1980s, he designed and built custom furniture, which was featured in many woodworking publications.  David Ellsworth introduced Layport to woodturning in 1992, and by 2000, he was turning wood professionally.  <I>Spawners Bowl</I> is representative of Layport's animal-figure works as well as his interest in ancient cultures.  He writes, animal effigy figures have inspired utilitarian vessels and ceremonial objects since the earliest forms of human expression.  My efforts are directed toward bringing my own voice to this ongoing dialogue.",
