  "text": "Agatha Wojciechowsky, a healer and Spiritualist minister, was prolific and versatile in her drawings. They ranged from kaleidoscopic, color-bursting spirit landscapes to densely packed webs of faces in clouds executed in pencil or ink. The artist made the work in a trance, guided by at least 11 spirits, whose proclivities seem to manifest in the range of styles she enacted. \r\n\r\nThe process always unfolded in the same manner. The spirits always began in the lower left-hand corner of a sheet and worked across the bottom from left to right in a band. Often, as in this case, they manifest as fantastic fields of nature from which tiny faces peer out. When fascinated reporters asked about her training or the source of her inspiration, she asserted consistently that she was “an instrument of the spirit world…I really have nothing to do with it. This is the work of different entities who take over and step into my body, directing my hand.”",
