  "text": "Around 1900, leading artists in Vienna picked up on the Arts and Crafts idea that art should touch every aspect of a citizen’s life. The Viennese magazine Die Graphischen Künste (The Graphic Arts) did its part by sending subscribers a yearly album (1898–1931) of original prints. The 1908 issue contained this woodcut. A native of Karlsbad, Bohemia (now part of the Czech Republic), Carl Thiemann worked near Prague before moving to an art colony in Dachau, Germany.",
