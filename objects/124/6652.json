  "text": "Buncheong ware, a high-fired, gray stoneware often boldly decorated with designs in white slip, was a direct descendent of the earlier celadon wares of the Goryeo dynasty. Yet Buncheong also represents a departure from these earlier wares inspired by Chinese porcelain. Although the clay and technology are similar, Buncheong glaze has less iron and the clay is less refined, resulting in the more earthy appearance of this covered box. The cover and body are decorated with designs of wavy lines and stylized chrysanthemums that were stamped onto the clay with white slip.",
