  "text": "This fabric produced by the Dutch firm of De Ploegstoffen shows how designers were embracing the advancements of the textile industry as well as reflecting new technology in the 1970s. By the end of the previous decade, rotary screen printers had become more sophisticated, and designers created patterns that took advantage of the precision and even color saturation that was then possible. Here, the bright pinks and reds create a bold, upbeat statement inspired by Pop Art.\r\n\r\nThe worldwide fascination with computers at the time is also evident here. The layering of identical petal shapes across the piece gives the impression of a computer-created design. In contrast to the quirky cartoon-like figures of the Stig Lindberg fabric also shown in this gallery, it showcases not the artist's hand but the computer-like precision of the design as executed by a highly-developed machine.",
