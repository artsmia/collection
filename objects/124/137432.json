  "text": "New York–based artist Sarah Crowner revels in the materials and processes of artmaking. Crowner’s multidisciplinary practice reimagines and repurposes raw materials—often canvas—in a collage-like process that generates dynamic geometric and biomorphic abstractions inspired by art history, fashion, graphic design, theater, and the decorative arts. For her collaboration with Highpoint Editions, a two-sheet diptych, Crowner explored abstraction through variations in scale, color, and texture. Untitled (Spotlights) features a simple arrangement of shapes formed from overlapping circles of unmodulated color. The two formations of “spotlights” appear in mirror-image symmetry but were printed in different colors. Each formation floats over a different background of color-printed wood grain derived from ready-made building materials.",
