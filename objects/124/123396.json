  "text": "Tappers are commonly used in Yoruba divination practices to greet and summon Orunmila, the god of fate who is associated with knowledge and wisdom. This example is made of ivory, a material treasured for its durability, scarcity, and association with the elephant—a symbol of sovereignty. Its pointed end is used to tap the divination tray. The handle is formed by a kneeling female figure holding her breasts, a common motif in Yoruba art that refers to humanity receiving spiritual nourishment.",
