  "text": "The Manhattan cocktail service, with its chromium column of a shaker, capitalized on the popularity of skyscrapers in New York such as the Chrysler Building and the Empire State Building, both completed in 1931.  It also capitalized on the popularity of the cocktail party, which came into vogue on the heels of Prohibition (which extened from 1920 to 1933).  Norman Bel Geddes was given credit for the design in Revere's 1935 catalogue.",
