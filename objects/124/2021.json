  "text": "Training predatory birds for hunting was a significant pastime of the Japanese aristocracy and a favorite painting subject. Master falconers (takajō) received a special rank within the samurai hierarchy during the Edo period (1603-1868). In this visual parody, Suzuki Harunobu depicts a falconer as an urban dandy (wakashu) with elegant green jacket, purple-and-pink striped kimono, and red-and-white striped sash. The raptor is probably a Northern Goshawk.",
