  "text": "This artwork is part of the series COVID-19: Labor Camp Report.   \r\n\r\nArtist's statement on this artwork originally published on the @laborcamp Instagram account: \r\n\r\n<i>Do you feel the constant sense of urgency, combined with a diffused, fractured and undirected purpose? Either not knowing what to do, or being unable to prioritize among the litany of issues that demand instant attention? A stunted emergency that requires immediate action, or no action at all, where even doing nothing feels like an act of vigilant awareness? I give you FONDE: Fear Of Not Doing Enough. (This classic finger pointing theme in propaganda designs typically gives you a concrete actionable directive. I emptied it of specific purpose, leaving only the ambiguous, anxiety laden tension. I feel it all the time.)</i>",
