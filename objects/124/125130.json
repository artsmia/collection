  "text": "Mr. Eddy Mumma was a self-taught artist who began to make paintings late in life. He took to it naturally and produced hundreds of images drawn from art history and his imagination. Mia’s collection includes eight works by Mumma including many that show his preference for big bold forms and wide-eyed anonymous portraits. More unusual are the nude–based on a reproduction he saw of a painting by Amedio Modigliani–and the little painting of the goat. Mumma had a difficult life with many personal challenges and artmaking seems to have been a great joy to him in his later years.",
