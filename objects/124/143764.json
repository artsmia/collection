  "text": "The children in this painting have been let loose in an attic to discover what has been hidden away. They play with dress up clothes, an old record player, and many other items that they have found. Emily Lunde, the artist, loved to paint her memories of growing up in Minnesota in the 1910s and 1920s and had an escially good feel for tapping into childhood and a sense of play.",
