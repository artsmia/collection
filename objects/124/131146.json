  "text": "Along with her contemporaries active in the field of wearable fiber art in the 1970s and 1980s, Linda Mendelson wrested marginalized techniques from the domestic sphere and placed them within the public realm of “fine art.” Mendelson’s preferred technique is knitting, and she is also known for incorporating phrases from songs and poems into her signature scarves and tunics. This coat features words and imagery (stars) from the popular 1934 song “Don’t Fence Me In, ” which begins: “Oh, give me land, lots of land under starry skies above.” The song was written by Cole Porter, based on an original poem by Robert Fletcher, a poet and highway official from Montana.",
