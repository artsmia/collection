  "text": "Pietro Testa's large complex print represents the golden age that will flourish in Rome following the election of Pope Innocent X in 1644. God the Father, in the celestial sphere above, reigns over the lush landscape filled with classizing figures, along with the pope, who is represented as a portrait bust the the coat of arms of his family, the Pamphili (three fleur-de-lys and a dove with an olive branch). Nymphs pick the fruits of a bountiful harvest, while allegories of avarice (the hungy wolf), and fear (crouching man with the rabbit) flee the city, along with vices, shown driven across the bridge by Hercules. This is a pointed critique of the former pope, Urban VIII Barberini (reign 1623-44), infamous for his nepotism.",
