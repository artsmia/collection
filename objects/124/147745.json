  "text": "Alexis Vollon was a versatile and respected painter and printmaker working in Paris. His prolific output of landscapes, still-lifes, portraits, and scenes of actors and everyday life clearly catered to public demand. But this exceptionally sensitive image is different. It is a portrait of his son Pierre and is dedicated to his wife, Mathilde. Pierre seems to have disappeared from the documentary record at a young age. His strict profile and solemn demeanor, plus the dedication to Mathilde, lead one to think that this could well be a memorial portrait of a recently deceased child given to a grieving mother.",
