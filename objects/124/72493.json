  "text": "The mythological Pygmalion was a sculptor who carved a woman of such perfection that he fell in love with it. The sculptor offered his creation gifts, dressed it, and prayed to Venus that he might be loved in return. In due course the love goddess answered his prayers by turning his statue into flesh. In Daumier's interpretation of this myth, a shocked Pygmalion gasps as his statue comes to life and immediately reaches down to take a pinch of snuff.",
