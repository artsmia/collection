  "text": "Kariginu is everyday wear for Shintō priests. Literally meaning “hunting wear, ” the garment is based on the hunting clothes of aristocrats in the Heian period (794-1185). Priests usually wear the kariginu over an underlayer called hitoe and sashinuki balloon pants, and an eboshi hat on their heads. The garment has a round collar and the sleeves are only sewn onto the back panel, leaving the front detached to allow for movement.",
