  "provenance": "(Possibly sale, London, March 3, 1908, lot 122); Fischoff[1]. [Galerie Charles Sedelmeyer, Paris, by 1911)[2]. Edward Rathbone Bacon (1846-1915), New York and Netherdale House, Turriff, Aberdeenshire (before d. 1915); by descent to his brother, Walter Rathbone Bacon, and his sister-in-law, Mrs. Virginia Purdy Bacon, New York (1915-19) [3]; by descent to the Bacon heirs (1919-23, Bacon sale, Christie's, London, July 13, 1923, no. 29, for 680 guineas, to Tooth); [Arthur Tooth and Sons, Ltd., London]. [Paul Cassirer, Berlin]. Dr. Paul Kempner, Berlin, Germany, before 1925, and possibly still in 1938 [3]. [Pinakos, Inc. (Rudolf Heinemann), New York, by 1944, sold, 1/3 share, ?May 18, 1944?, to Knoedler ]; [M. Knoedler and Co., Inc., New York, 1944-45; stock no. A2773, sold, January 3, 1945, for $21, 000, Mia].\r\n\r\n[1] According to Art Sales III, p. 331, Fischoff purchased the painting for £504. It has not been proven that this work is our painting. A second, smaller version exists which may conflict with provenance and exhibition history. [Neither Scipio nor the Frick have a sale catalogue for March 3, 1908 auction in London] \r\n\r\n[2] The work was referred to in a 1925 Sedelmeyer exhibition.\r\n\r\n[3] Kempner was a partner in the firm of Bankhaus Mendelssohn & Co. This fact is also stated on the invoice from Knoedler. The aryanization of the bank forced him to emigrate first to England and then the US in 1939.\r\n\r\n[4] Knoedler stock book (Getty Provenance Index) indicates that the painting was owned jointly between Pinakos, Inc. (2/3 share) and Knoedler (1/3 share). Mia purchased a smaller Ruysdael from Knoedler in December 1944, for $5, 000 (Knoedler stock no. A3002; Mia L43.2055, River Scene with Boats, 22 1/2 x 17 1/2 in.]; then exchanged this picture with Knoedler for larger Ruysdael (L44.1816; 45.9, River Scene 53 x 41 1/2 in.) in January 1945.",

  "text": "Nothing could be more Dutch than boats on a wide river under a cloudy sky: a ferry approaching shore, a rowboat out for a joy ride, a sailboat heading to the horizon. Water was crucial to Holland’s flourishing economy, with rivers and canals serving as its main commercial arteries. To the Dutch, such images of serene rivers and boats were emotionally resonant, underscoring the peacefulness and affluence of their newly independent country.",
