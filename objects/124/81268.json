  "text": "With his distinctive almond eyes and full lips as seen here, Sawamura Tanosuke II was a rising onnagata (female impersonator) star when this print was made. Based on a play staged in the third lunar month of 1816, this fan print shows one of the last portraits of this promising actor, who died prematurely during the following year. He is shown in the role of the woman Yae. A pattern of cherry blossoms (sakura in Japanese) adorning his kimono's collar alludes to Yae's husband, Sakuramaru.",
