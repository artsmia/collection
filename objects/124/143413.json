  "text": "June Leaf has quietly developed a body of work that crosses genres and incorporates a wide range of materials. She refers to herself as an “inventor” rather than an artist. Drawing is an essential part of her thinking and has consistently fed into her various projects, whether kinetic sculpture, painting, assemblages, theater sets, and other kinds of constructions. She was born in Chicago and attended the Institute of Design, but for many decades now she has divided her time between New York and Mabou, Nova Scotia.\r\n\r\nLeaf based this fluid watercolor and ink drawing on actual birds she had observed, but she has reimagined them with a surreal twist. The birds stand taller than human beings, and people gather to admire them from a safe distance.",
