  "text": "The Berber women of Morocco have long been admired for their elaborate weaving. Like cloth in many parts of the Islamic world, a mantel such as this is often multifunctional. When worn as a wraparound winter cloak, the fabric is held in place by a pin inserted through the overlapping corners under the chin. With its glass beads and sequins, the cloth can also serve as a decorative bedcovering for an honored guest.\r\n\r\nThese textiles are labor-intensive and made from expensive materials, including silk, and therefore signify the wealth of the owner. The also can express a personal aesthetic, ethnic identity through specific patterning and designs, or professional pride.",
