  "text": "This liberated being (Jina) is one of 24 teachers that Jain devotees worship.  Standing on a lotus petal base in a meditative symmetrical posture, his nudity links him to the <i>digambara</i> (sky-clad) sect of Jainism. This small sculpture might have been part of a larger assemblage of 24 Jina sculptures, expressing the same concept as the devotional plaque currently installed next to it. Just like any other ritual bronze, this sculpture would have been rubbed with sandal paste and received regular lustrations of water, milk, curds, and clarified butter.",
