  "text": "At first glance, this work lacks refinement and displays somewhat exhibitionist brushwork, but it is noteworthy because of the artist's creativity in handling rather traditional subject matter. Zhang manipulated the ink with great dexterity and spontaneity to create stimulating visual structures. The artist imbued his forms with exceptional vitality, which augments the visual tension between his relatively abstract natural images.",
