  "text": "Tsukioka Yoshitoshi, like Kawanabe Kyōsai, whose painting Wisteria Maiden and Demon Priest is hanging nearby, was a student of Utagawa Kuniyoshi (1798–1861), the foremost designer of warrior prints in the mid-19th century. Yoshitoshi captured Shōki standing firm in a substantial breeze that makes his robe flow and long hair and beard swirl. A subjugated demon is holding the scabbard of Shōki’s drawn sword.",
