  "text": "<span>This striking sculpture represents Ryūjin, the Dragon King of the Sea and a revered deity in Japanese mythology. With his fierce red visage, elongated limbs, and elaborate crown of swirling sea forms, Ryūjin is shown in anthropomorphic form—both human and divine. He holds a sacred jewel at his center, symbolizing his power to control the tides and weather. On his back is a dragon that grasps the lotus flower which tops Ryūjin’s crown. The flower can be opened to reveal a hidden meditating Buddha, suggesting that this sculpture was created at a time when the Meiji government tried to break the century-long tradition of Shintō-Buddhist syncretism in favor of Shintō.</span>",
