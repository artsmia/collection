  "text": "Fukami Sueharu uses a signature combination of bluish-white glaze and high-pressure slip-casting technique for porcelain to create his bluish-green porcelain sculptures. Fukami was inspired by qingbai wares, a type of porcelain produced in Jingdezhen and other kiln sites in China during the Song (960–1279) and Yuan (1280–1368) dynasties, that was characterized by a blue-green tint on a white body. \r\nFukami uses the same mold to produce multiple objects, just as a printer can create several nearly identical prints from the same plate, but he limits his forms to editions of seven.",
