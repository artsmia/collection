  "text": "In Sources of Strength, Jaune Quick-to-See Smith blends traditional and present day styles in depicting cultural symbols that she finds meaningful. Some, like the Thunderbird and bear on the left, are depicted in petroglyph form. Others, like the horse on the right, are shown in a more modern style. Tying the whole painting together are strong zigzag lines, which recall symbols used in historical Plains Indian art to depict lightning, thunder, and spiritual power. By combining the imagery of historical Native American beliefs with more current symbols, Jaune Quick-to-See Smith brings traditional art into the present.",
