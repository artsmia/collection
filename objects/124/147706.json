  "text": "This work is part of Wada Morihiro’s series titled “Watashigaraki, ” a playful neologism and wordplay that could be read as “Watashigara vessel, ” “Wada’s Shigaraki (Wada [no] shigaraki), ” “My Shigaraki (Watashi no Shigaraki), ” or “I am lucky (Watashi ga rakkī).” In this series, he experimented with the clay type and placement within the kiln. He used blended Shinohara clay with filtered yellow clay for its texture and fired the work in the back of the tunnel kiln to maximize the ash effects on the vessel. Speaking of this series, Wada wrote, “By creating vessels with many irregular sides, I hoped to highlight the characteristics of Shigaraki firing techniques, as portions of the vessel would display strong kiln effects while others remained unchanged; but I could not be certain that I would succeed. Wood-burning kilns are unpredictable and impossible to control. It felt as though I was in a high-stakes competition where everything would be decided in a single match.”",
