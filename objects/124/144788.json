  "text": "Miwa Kazuhiko is now the 13th in his family, after his father and brother, to assume the name Kyūsetsu. Yet Kazuhiko deviated in one way from the family tradition, by studying in San Francisco, where he pursued greater artistic freedom. In his works, he sometimes uses gold embellishments, a dramatic contrast to the typical creamy white Hagi glaze.",
