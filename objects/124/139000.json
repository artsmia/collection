  "text": "Joel Robinson was a talented New York graphic artist who in 1951, at the young age of 28, won the distinction of being the first Black artist to ever win MoMA’s coveted Good Design award. He remains the only known Black designer to have obtained this achievement. Robinson’s winning design was Ovals, which featured black ovals of various sizes printed on white linen. Alongside five other textile designs by Robinson, Ovals was featured at the Museum of Modern Art’s annual Good Design exhibition from November 28, 1951, to January 27, 1952 in a display designed by leading Danish architect, Finn Juhl.",
