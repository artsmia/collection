  "text": "During the first quarter of the 20th century, Saitō Bishū’s grandfather founded a production group of carvers that was continued by Bishū’s father, who once employed more than forty carvers. Bishū himself learned carving from his father when he was 17, and at a young age he began reproducing antique netsuke (small carved toggles used to fasten objects to a kimono sash). His modern carvings are very imaginative and innovative, bordering on the abstract. He created this selection in the 1970s and 1980s.",
