  "text": "Despite the title, the subject of this print is not the Tale of Genji itself but rather a nineteenth century takeoff of it, the novel Nise Murasaki inaka Genji (False Murasaki and Rustic Genji) written by Ryñtei Tanehiko. Featuring action and adventure, Ryñtei's adaptation of the classical courtly romance became popular among the masses, which prompted ukiyo-e artists to design prints illustrating scenes from the novel. For this print, Hiroshige depicts Mitsuuji, the hero of the novel, visiting a shrine on Akashi beach with his attendants. Hiroshige exercised artistic license by setting the scene in snow, thus creating a fan with a cool image for use during Japan's hot summer months.",
