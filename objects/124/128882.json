  "text": "McArthur Binion is a prominent American artist whose paintings, drawings, and prints explore a range of subjects associated with identity, personal history, Black experience, geometric abstraction, and the creative process. Re: Mine is part of an extended series of editioned prints Binion produced during a seven-year collaboration with Paulson Fontaine Press in Berkeley, California, that began in 2015. In this print, Binion asserts his presense by repurposing a 1971 black-and-white photograph of himself taken while he lived and worked in the Soho district of New York City. For Binion and other Black artists of his generation, asserting artistic presence and personal experience was often met with indifference by the mainstream art world. For this reason, self-portrature was a common feature of Binion's work. Reproduced both horitzontally and vertically within a grid-like geometric abstraction, the serial image of the artist blends personal and emotional content into the language of Minimalism.",
