  "text": "Elizabeth Christie Austen Brown specialized in the saturated colors of early evening, when it’s time to lead the cows back home. She was skilled at distilling her compositions, jigsaw-like, to their essential forms. This is probably a view of the French countryside; Austen Brown and her artist husband, Thomas Austen Brown (1857–1924), had a studio in the artist colony of Camiers, a village in northern France.",
