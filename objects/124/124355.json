The classical subject matter is rendered here in a combination of different materials following the practice of sculptors in ancient times. Although Gerome was one of the most famous academic painters of the 1800s, in 1878 he renounced his paintings as inferior and devoted himself to sculpture for the rest of his career, becoming equally well known in this area",
