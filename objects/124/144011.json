  "text": "Paule Marrot was a leading French textile designer and artist in the mid twentieth century. Her work was coveted by decorators and socialites throughout her long career. Marrot also made inroads for women designers in the automotive industry when she was contracted by Renault to design textiles for car interiors. “Tulipes” was created during a particularly fruitful period of Marrot’s career when she not only produced a large quantity of designs but earned national and international recognition by winning multiple prestigious design awards.",
