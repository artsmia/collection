  "text": "This coffeepot and the red example nearby are both made of stoneware, but with decidely different results.  Here the body of the coffepot retains the more typical orange-peel texture associated with 17th- and 18th-century white and brown English stonewares.  The jewel-like enamel colors provide a refined floral adornment, similar to that seen on the French <I>faience</I> or tin-glazed earthenware plate.",
