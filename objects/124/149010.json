Their custom designs adhered to the same unified design philosophy as progressive architects in the Midwest such as Frank Lloyd Wright and Purcell and Elmslie. Greene and Greene strove to design a home, its interiors, furniture, lighting, and even landscape, together. </span></p><p>The table and sideboard from the William T. Bolton house in Pasadena are fine examples of the <span>Greenes' luxurious work for their clients, inspired by their admiration of Asian art and architecture. The pieces are crafted of Honduran mahogany, a hardwood rarely used in Arts and Crafts furniture; the Bolton dining room was paneled with the same wood. The sinuous curves of the table and sideboard reference classical Chinese furniture, and the overhanging elements recall Japanese architecture. The edges of the table and sideboard feature square ebony pegs that cover connecting dowels, a clever device used to decorative effect by Peter and John Hall, the Greenes' cabinetmakers. </span></p><p><span></span></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<font face=Times New Roman size=3> </font>\n\t\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t</tbody>\n\t</table>\n\t<font face=Times New Roman size=3>  </font>\n</div>\n<font face=Times New Roman size=3>  </font>",
