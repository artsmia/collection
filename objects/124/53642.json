  "text": "An inscription that accompanied later editions of this image attests to this creature's predations: The beast, born in the burning sands of Africa, lived in the ruined palace once belonging to Masinissa (ca. 240-148 B.C.), the former ruler of Numidia, a retreat which the chimera left only to devour animals and unwary travelers. Neither land nor sea could contain the monster, who moved ceaselessly over both in his unending hunt. Here, a blazing sun and an arch describe the chimera's African habitat; the ground is crawling with reptiles and strewn with the remains of victims.",
