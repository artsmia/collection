  "text": "John Tunnard was one of a group of abstract artists who brought a new energy to British modern art of the 1930s and '40s. With a mixture of Surrealist and Constructivist influences, his paintings and gouaches depict worlds where technology and nature merge in mysterious, dreamlike landscapes. Lunar Synthesis depicts a moon shrouded behind a cloud within a contrapuntal interplay of transparent planes and forms. With its tense, wire-like lines and masterful range of textures, it embodies what one critic described as romantic abstraction and persuasive poetry.",
