  "text": "It is rare for an ancient inkstone to survive with its fitted box, and this example, with its silver pedestal base and cover, is a testament to the high status accorded writing implements by China’s scholar class. The stone used here for the grinding palette is the fine-grained, purplish-gray Duan stone from Guangdong province in south China. It is carved in the shape of the Chinese character for wind (<i>feng</i> 风), and its flat grinding surface slopes down to a water well enclosed by a raised border. The lidded pedestal base is pierced on all four sides with wide oval openings and is fashioned entirely from sheet silver. Silver and gold utensils were popular among Tang and Liao aristocracy, particularly for special items.",
