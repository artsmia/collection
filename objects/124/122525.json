  "text": "Rubbing incense (<I>zukō</I>)—powdered incense mixed with liquid to form a thick paste—has several ritual uses in Buddhism. It is applied to the body and also to icons to remove any uncleanness. It is also offered to the Buddha as one of the Five Types of Offerings (<I>go-kuyō</I>), along with incense, foodstuff, candles, and adornments. Containers for rubbing incense, like this gilt bronze example, are thus essential implements in Buddhist ritual.",
