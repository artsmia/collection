  "text": "Since all the poems included in this print refer to things associated with autumn, it must have commemorated a sumo match held that season. The large wrestler is getting dressed in a red and white ceremonial apron, which is worn for a ritual performed by ranking wrestlers before the day's bouts begin. Another wrestler of lower rank helps him secure the apron. Wrestlers are ranked by their achievements in a tournament and could lose their rank if they underperform.",
