  "text": "The Nuremburg Chronicle proved to be one of the supreme achievements in book publishing during the16th century. Using 652 clocks, publisher Anton Koberger printed 1804 illustrations in the tome, which you may see in a nearby display case. The designs were made by and under the supervision of Michael Wolgemut and his stepson Wilhelm Pleydenwurff. Many of the images are lively, charming, and complex. As is often the case in medieval art, two moments in time are shown in a single image. To the right, we see Adam and Eve, who appear to have already eaten the forbidden fruit of the Tree of Knowledge, for they cover themselves-at least in modesty if not shame; at left, a sword wielding angel expels them from the lush paradise, driving them into a barren landscape.",
