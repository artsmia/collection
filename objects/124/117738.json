  "text": "Yamamoto Baiitsu is best known for his large-scale paintings of birds and flowers, characterized by delicate brushwork. However, this painting is typical of Baiitsu’s work in the style of Chinese scholar-painters: a clump of bamboo painted with a wet inky brush, behind a rough rock rendered with a much drier brush. \r\n In his youth, Baiitsu learned a number of different painting styles from artists in his native Nagoya before earning the patronage of a local merchant and collector of old Chinese paintings and calligraphy. This relationship gave Baiitsu access to Chinese paintings he could copy and painting manuals he could use to study ink and brush techniques. With the death of his patron in 1802, Baiitsu headed to Edo (modern-day Tokyo) and Kyoto, where he eventually rose to prominence in the cities’ literati painting circles.",
