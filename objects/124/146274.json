  "text": "This teabowl is from Wada Morihiro’s series Brilliance and Mystery. Wada graduated in 1967 from Kyoto City College of Fine Arts. The seminal ceramicist Tomimoto Kenkichi was one of his instructors and a significant influence on Wada in his early years but while he was at university he also became acquainted with Hamada Shōji and Kamoda Shōji. Wada had his first single artist show in 1968 and seven years later he moved to the region of Kasama in Ibaraki Prefecture. Kasama was a ceramic center not far from Tokyo. After the move, he began creating more sculptural pieces, switching from the wheel to hand building process. Throughout his career Wada won many notable prizes, both in Japan and at international venues.",
