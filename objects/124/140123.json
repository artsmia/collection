  "text": "Today, the Palazzo Madama in Rome is the seat of Italy's senate. The building first went up in the late 1400s and was finished in 1505. Generations of the famous Florentine Medici lived there. Their coat-of-arms appears over the door leading to the center balcony. The present etching shows a then-new replacement facade. The print attributes the architectural design to Paolo Maroscelli--Paolo Marucelli (1594-1649)--who is otherwise known primarily for church architecture. It is unclear whether the construction was even complete when this print was made, since it omits the decorative urns that were spaced along the roof.",
