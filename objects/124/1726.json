  "text": "François Rude studied in Paris and Dijon, France before being exiled to Brussels for his ardent support of Napoleon Bonaparte.  He did not return to France until twelve years after the fall of the Empire.  Although inspired by the poses of antique sculpture, Rude depicted his subjects with delicacy and emotion rather than with classical restraint.  He is best known for his figure of The Genius of Liberty, called The Marseillaise, which is the central figure of the Arc de Triomphe in Paris that he completed in 1836.",
