  "text": "Silk <i>kashaya</i>, usually belonging to high-ranking abbots and senior monks, are more sumptuous than the cotton and hemp robes worn by the general priesthood. The elaborate design of this vestment includes several five-clawed dragons depicted with gold thread, cavorting within a celestial landscape. This imperial imagery indicates that the robe belonged to a court-sponsored temple. The rectangular shape was designed to be draped over the left shoulder, under the right arm, and fastened under the left shoulder with ties.",
