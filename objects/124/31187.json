  "text": "Daybeds of all types are commonly depicted in paintings and other illustrations of scholars’ studios. During the day such furniture served as a sitting or reclining platform, work area or storage surface while during the night, a bed for sleeping. As a standard form, the daybed retained the antique elegance of the raise dais or platform that a respected nobleman, scholar, or priest might occupy. This waisted bed of corner-leg construction reflects the more massive proportions and simplicity associated with Ming scholars' taste.",
