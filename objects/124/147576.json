  "text": "Okuda Kōdō trained as a painter before turning to carving which he learned from his father. His modern netsuke, which were traditionally used to affix objects like tobacco pouches to the sash of the kimono, are all original designs taken from contemporary Japanese life or from folklore. His training as a painter shows in his distinctive carvings that serve as his canvas. Using a meticulously controlled palette of lacquer colors, dyes, gold leaf, platinum, and mother-of-pearl inlays—applied with masterful technique—he combines intricate carving with a deep understanding of form and an almost microscopic knowledge of anatomy. At times, his work creates a striking illusion of realism, yet it is the deliberately subtle elements of stylization that truly showcase his mastery of the medium.",
