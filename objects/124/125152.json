  "text": "The earthquake and tsunami of 2011 in the Tōhoku region of Japan had a profound impact on Futamura Yoshimi. This is reflected in her recent work, in which she explores the notions of impermanence and natural disaster. She has described her post-2011 work as “represent[ing] a fear of the uncertain, a force beyond our control which threatens to extinguish everything, even the desire for rebirth. The Tōhoku earthquake reminded me of how grateful I am to have grown up in Japan, as I could not be where I am today without its cultural influence.”",
