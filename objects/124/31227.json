  "text": "With a handle cast to simulate bamboo, the openwork pattern in the bowl of this spoon, as well as its overall design, are characteristic of the style of the Chu kingdom during the late Eastern Zhou era. This southern region also developed polychrome lacquer designs that undoubtedly influenced the complex decorative motifs found on textiles, inlaid bronzes, and cast bronzes that have been exhumed from numerous ancient Chu tombs.",
