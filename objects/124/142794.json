  "text": "This vibrant painting on paper owes its brightness to the intense color combinations and heightened tones that the artist used. Bright thin yellow paint covers most but not all of the background, letting the cream color of the paper shine through. The volatile, vibrating oranges that seem slashed over the surface contrast with thin black lines. Together these elements make for an exciting abstract image. While the artist's process might have been quick, he was careful to plan each of the elements so they do not turn into a muddied mess. Such eye-dazzling images were inspired by nature, although Morrison chose not to refer directly to that source.",
