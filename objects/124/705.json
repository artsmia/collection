  "text": "One of the most famous dinner services produced by Sèvres was commissioned for Louis Renè Edouard, Prince of Rohan, Cardinal de Rohan, and bishop of Strasbourg (1734-1803).  Before Rohan was lured into a fraudulent scheme involving a diamond necklace, he enjoyed a very privileged status in the royal court of Marie Antoinette and King Louis XVI.  Rohan's initials, PLR, for Prince Louis Rohan, form the central design on each plate. The decoration of the service featured Rohan's monogram (PLR for Prince Louis Rohan), three white ovals with Kakiemon (Japanese-inspired) scenes, birds, gilded foliage, and the bleu céleste color made famous by Sèvres.",
