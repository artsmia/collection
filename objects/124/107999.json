  "text": "Charles Red Grooms is a contemporary American artist best known for his large-scale mixed-media, self-named sculpto-pictoramas, and installations depicting dynamic scenes of modern urban life populated with an array of colorful characters. Much of his work chronicles American life with a comic style that is characterized by wit, humor, and appreciation of human nature. In addition to his images of American culture, Grooms has produced several series inspired by his travels abroad, including trips to Japan, Morocco, and Russia.  Such work is informed by the artist's memories, interactions with other cultures, and thoughts on globalization.  Leningrad Circus is part of a group of works based on his trip to Russia in May 1989 and is an excellent example of Grooms' intense compositions and bright, bold color palettes.",
