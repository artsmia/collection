  "text": "Art dealer Ambrose Vollard was a powerful figure in Picasso’s life. He gave him his first exhibition, and in 1930, he commissioned the production of 100 etchings that became known as the Suite Vollard. Picasso showed his respect by producing several portraits of his patron: a cubist painting, and three etchings, which belonged to the Suite. In this likeness, one senses the toughness and determination that Vollard brought to his business.",
