  "text": "Small square or rectangular high tables were generally used in wealthy households as incense stands. This sixteenth-century example has an inlaid marble top that provided a durable, fire-retardant surface for the burning of rare fragrances. Incense stands were typically fitted with floor-stretchers (horizontal leg braces) creating, in effect, a space-frame of well-balanced proportions and minimalist form. All edges and corners of the wooden members are rounded including the foot of each leg. This softens an otherwise rigid box-like shape into a more aesthetically pleasing one. Such stands were used individually indoors and out, in pairs flanking thrones, and as stands in front of ancestral shrines or large altar tables.\r\n<P>Illustrated Ming books suggest that both round and square incense stands were common in upper-class households, but due to fragility of construction remarkably few have survived. Burning of aromatic incense was undertaken in ceremonial worship, as a connoisseur's pastime, and for the general perfuming of interior spaces.",
