  "text": "This head of a buddha once belonged to a large sculpture that was probably located on the wall of a cave temple. The idea of carving temples and monastic complexes into living rock comes from India, but it became a favorite type of religious architecture in China as well. Often the back wall of a cave was devoted to a large buddha, like this one, flanked by attendant bodhisattvas.",
