  "text": "Minnesota artist Theodore Richardson fell in love with Alaska and made numerous trips to the state to depict its environment and geography. This watercolor depicts a tidewater glacier that is recognized as the deepest, thickest (4, 845 feet) alpine temperate glacier in the world. It has been in retreat since 2019 because of climate change. Richardson adored hiking through Alaskan forests and along the coast and often made his watercolors outdoors and right on the spot. That is likely the case with this watercolor.",
