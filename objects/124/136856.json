  "text": "Technically not a textile, since it is not woven, tapa barkcloth is predominantly manufactured from the soft inner bark of the paper mulberry tree, strips of which are soaked, pounded, and then glued or felted together to produce large sheets. Traditionally, barkcloth was used for clothing, bedding, as gifts in rites of passage, and as a form of currency. Barkcloth continues to play a vital role in ceremonial life in many areas of Polynesia, and for many decades has also been made for the international market.",
