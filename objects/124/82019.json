  "text": "The Torah pointer is used for reading the Torah (biblical) scroll, to avoid touching the sacred manuscript with the hand. The flat form of this pointer is typical of Morocco. Although primarily a Muslim country since the 7th century CE, Morocco has had Jewish communities for over two thousand years. The first Jewish Diaspora to that country dates back to the 4th century BCE, while the second large-scale immigration followed the expulsion of Spanish Jewry in 1492. Over the centuries, Jews in Morocco benefitted from official protection. They performed services for the sovereigns, including the collection of customs duty and diplomacy, and they were engaged in commerce and crafts, especially jewel-making for themselves and their Berber and Arab fellow-countrymen.",
