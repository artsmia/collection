  "text": "The origin of Oribe ware is unknown, but it is associated with the rise of tea culture, around 1600. Simple underglaze paintings, green glaze, and asymmetrical or deformed shapes are characteristics of Oribe ware. Suzuki Gorō revives traditional Oribe by modernizing the painted elements, further increasing the playfulness to heights of unrivaled inventiveness.",
