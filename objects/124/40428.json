  "text": "American dancer Loie Fuller (1863–1928) developed her own modern dance in Paris in the 1890s, becoming famous for her “Serpentine Dance, ” which created its effect from the swirling motion of her fluid garments. On November 5, 1892, Fuller made her debut at the Paris music hall the Folies Bèrgere. She designed a special podium with movable mirrors and rows of colored lightbulbs. She overwhelmed the audience with this kaleidoscopic combination of light, color, and motion. The French sculptor François-Raoul Larche designed several Fuller lamps, including this one, to capture the spirit of her famous dance.",
