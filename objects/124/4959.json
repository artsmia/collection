  "text": "The Lakota had a complex system of societies that were associated with animals, sacred power, and battle exploits.  Members of the Elk Dreamer's Society had to have a vision involving elk in order to be a member.  Participants usually wore and used items with elk imagery, like this pouch.  During their ceremonies, some members wore masks that symbolized elk and carried a decorated hoop.  One of the powers that Elk Dreamer's had was the ability to control love.",
