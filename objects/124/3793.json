  "text": "Worn by both men and women, mantles have a long history of providing extra warmth in the Andean highlands. Still popular today among Quechua women, mantles continue to convey long-standing symbols of gender and rank. Women wear the mantle across their back, draping it over their shoulders like a shawl. They fasten it together in the front using a pin called a <I>tupu</I>â€”itself a symbol of status and prestige. While mantle sizes typically vary by region, their construction is fairly consistent. Mantles are woven in two separate pieces, and when joined together, the completed garment contains wide patterned stripes across a solid-color background. When draped across the back, the stripes appear horizontally, a distinctly feminine style.",
