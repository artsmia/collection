  "text": "How might you picture a corner of your yard? If you have a pet, would you include them? Artist Sarah McEneaney painted a small corner of her yard in Philadelphia placing us near the vantage point of her orange tabby cat, Stanley at bottom right. Roaming free in the yard, at the edge of a raised garden bed sprouting new flowers, he appears to pause, enraptured by the pale sun and its showering rays on a Spring day. Yet, this is a cat, and it might be more likely that he is eyeing the birds perched high in the tree. Either way, Stanley is memoralized by McEneaney here in what the title tells us was his last Spring.",
