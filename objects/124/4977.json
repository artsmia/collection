  "text": "Comprised of only eleven pieces of wood, this beautifully proportioned side table consists of a solid plank top to which the four corner legs have been attached without the usual reinforcing with stretchers or giant's arm braces. The result is an exceptionally simple and minimalist frame called four-sides-square. The epitome of restraint, it is made possible by unusually complicated joins that at once secure each leg to two aprons and the top at the corner.",
