  "text": "A hallmark of Suzuki Harunobu’s artistic vision is his charming, if somewhat unlikely, depiction of young lovers. Here, a couple gives sake to a rooster in hopes the bird will become too intoxicated to crow, thus prolonging their time together before the household awakens. Seen through the open sliding door, a lantern in the adjoining room indicates it is still early morning, before the previous evening’s accoutrements have been stowed away. However, beyond the woven fence at lower right, an <I>unohana</I> flower, which blossoms in summer, hints that dawn will come early, adding urgency to the lovers’ antics.",
