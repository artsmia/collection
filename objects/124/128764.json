  "text": "This dapper, bespectacled toad wears a cutaway morning coat, vest, and shirt. His trousers are short, perhaps rolled up to avoid the morning dew. He reaches out in a gesture of warm greeting and offers a toothless smile. Could he be Mr. Toad from The Wind in the Willows? Or, Toad of Toad Hall? We wish we knew who made this charming lithograph.",
