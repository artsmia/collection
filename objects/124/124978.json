  "text": "Using photomontage, a collage technique first developed by avant-garde artists associated with the anti-establishment European Dada movement of the 1910s and 1920s, German artist and musician Thomas Zipp confronts a dark chapter in world history in his “Black Dada” portfolio (Mia 2018.123.4.1-.14). Each composition starts with a photograph of Otto Hahn, a German scientist whose pioneering work in nuclear fission led to the development of the atomic bomb, a weapon of mass destruction leading to over 120, 000 Japanese civilian deaths in World War II (1939–1945).\r\n\r\nZipp altered Hahn’s portrait by introducing additional photographic images and some hand-drawn passages to create a deep web of associations regarding the social and political consequences of this historic scientific advancement. Several prints in the series, including snow and o.4, allude to the horrific after-effects of atomic tests in the South Pacific.",
