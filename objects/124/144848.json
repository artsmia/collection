  "text": "In his youth, Wada Morihiro went to Kyoto to study under Tomimoto Kenkichi (also represented in this exhibition), a master of modern porcelain decoration. Wada built his own kiln in Ibaraki Prefecture, and his subsequent work became more closely related to the confident designs of Kamoda Shōji (1933–1983), who lived in that area. Wada\ndeveloped his own decorative styles using a broad range of surface patterning.",
