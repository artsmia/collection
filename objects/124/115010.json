  "text": "Describing the site where he built his summer home in Brittany, France, Henri Rivière wrote about a seaside cliff covered with pines and heather. One could imagine this print following from his dreamy prose. “You could believe yourself at the end of the world there, in the still virgin countryside, ” he wrote, “where the noise of the winds and the sea, the cries of the birds … were the only sounds which enlivened the harmonious landscape which changed in itself and its color according to the effects and the hours.”",
