  "text": "Greely Myatt’s sculptural installation, Roomrug, harkens back to the history of American Art. The work is comprised of four separate sections. Each section is comprised of two mirrors that frame a grouping of found broom handles which are laid out in the shape of a braided rug. Threaded across his broad body of work is the theme of communication and the use of light. Roomrug uses light through the illusion created by the juxtaposition of mirrors to create an infinite room filled with rugs created from found broom handles and mirrors. The broom handles are layered into a rainbow of colors---another direct reference to light. Myatt’s work uses light to implement the idea of 'closure'; an idea that takes advantage of the placement of seemingly absent forms within an artwork so that the viewer mentally completes the work.",
