  "text": "Judith is so opulently dressed, it is tempting to see Holofernes' head as another accessory. Indeed, the frame can barely contain her commanding presence, punctuated with the symbols of power: heavy chain, fur collar, and frontal pose. Collectors of Barthel Beham's engravings craved such minute, virtuosic details. Even more entertaining for connoisseurs, however, may have been the look of terror on Holofernes' disembodied head, apparently reacting to Judith's weapon even in death.",
