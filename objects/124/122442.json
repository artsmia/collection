  "text": "丹波 Tanba ware\r\n\r\nThis is an example of Tanba ware, named for the old province of Tanba, the area northwest of Kyoto where the kilns were traditionally located. Tanba ware has been produced there since the 1100s. Tanba jars and vases are often dark in color, due to the high iron content of the local clay. Vessels made before the late 1500s are either unglazed or enhanced only by natural ash glaze. The firing process for Tanba ware can take up to two weeks. Layers of wood ash that settled on this large storage jar during its long firing formed an irregular pattern of yellow-brown glaze over a portion of the neck, shoulder, and body.",
