  "text": "Rouault’s early training as a maker of stained-glass windows left a permanent mark on his art. Often sections of color are divided by strong outlines akin to the leading on church windows. In 'Circus Performer', such heavy divisions are seen particularly along the contours of the woman’s shoulders and legs, as well as on her chest and around her head. Though the scene is in the undefined space of some klieg-lit arena, the color recalls the play of light in the shadowy aisles of a medieval church—glorious transparent blues, rosy pinks, and shimmering yellows amid looming, mysterious surroundings.",
