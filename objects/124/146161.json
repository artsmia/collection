  "text": "This storage jar, of the type often referred to as proto-celadon, is shaped after an archaic bronze vessel type known as bu (also known as pou). The high-fired lime glaze of thin olive-green, which usually is slightly mottled, is restricted to the upper areas. On the lower half of the vessel, the exposed body has turned a distinctive reddish brown. Its greenish color is due to the presence of iron and titanium oxides. On opposing sides are two sturdy and elaborate lugs each decorated with a human-mask, a pattern evolved from early bronze vessel forms. On its upper body there are three raised bands. Archaeological evidence suggests that most of such “proto-celadon” wares were manufactured in the vicinity of northern Zhejiang and southern Jiangsu provinces. The jar serves as an excellent example demonstrating the works at a transitional stage from pottery to porcelain which begins to appear during the Eastern Han dynasty (25–220) in present-day Zhejiang province.",
