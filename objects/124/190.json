  "text": "This chair is termed “Greek” because its legs recall those on Greek furniture, which Godwin sketched from classical marble sculptures in the British Museum. The overall angularity and lack of ornament were an inspiration to the modern design movement of the late 1800s. Though Godwin was not alone in introducing the slant back, his dramatic chair is a link to later designers like Frank Lloyd Wright.",
