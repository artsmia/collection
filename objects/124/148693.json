  "text": "This finely modeled pair of painted earthenware figures represents female court musicians from the Song dynasty. One plays a three-stringed lute (sanxian), while the other claps in rhythmic accompaniment. With animated gestures, expressive faces, and flowing robes tinted in red, purple, and black, the figures capture the elegance of courtly performance and the artistic refinement of the era. Beyond their funerary function, these musicians reflect the Song dynastyâ€™s humanistic ideals and the cultural importance of music. Such figures were placed in tombs to delight and serve the deceased in the afterlife. Their lively presence and careful detail offer a poignant glimpse into the performative, emotional, and aesthetic dimensions of Song elite life.",
