  "text": "During the Meji period, Japanese artisans like Echigo-no Kami, the creator of this vase, shifted their work to meet the tastes of an international market. John Scott Bradstreet, who bought this vase, was exactly the type of foreign consumer they hoped to reach. A Minneapolis-based designer and interior decorator, Bradstreet influenced local tastes by importing Asian goods to adorn the homes of Minnesota’s wealthiest families. To some extent these artisans were victims of their own success, as Bradstreet also developed his own designs and manufacturing processes in response to the growing appreciation for Japanese decorative arts—often bypassing Japanese artisans entirely. Examples of Bradstreet’s Japanese-inspired design can be seen in the living room from the circa 1906 William and Mina Prindle House, on view on the third floor at Mia.",
