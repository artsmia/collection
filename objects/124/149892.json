  "text": "This large, formal outer robe or uchikake served as costume for a Kagura dance of Tsuchigumo (lit. earth spider) when the monstrous spider is disguised as the maid Kochō who tries to poison Minamoto Yorimitsu. Dominating the upper section of the back is a gigantic golden spider rendered in dynamic, expressive detail—its legs splayed wide across a background of radiating spiderweb motifs stitched in metallic thread. The creature’s exaggerated glass eyes and fangs give it a striking, supernatural presence. Below the spider, the design transitions into a contrasting motif: a bamboo lattice interwoven with flowers.",
