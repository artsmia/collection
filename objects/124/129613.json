  "text": "This shirt combines a technique that is very popular in African couture, the Dutch wax print technique, with imagery that refers to the Yoruba religion. For the Nigerian Yoruba people and their descendants in the African Diaspora, the pumpkin represents a mystic bowl that plays a role in the creation myth. In her work, Ruby Jay-Pang Somerson pays tribute to the cultural heritage of the Raizals, an Afro-Caribbean group, descendants of enslaved Africans who speak a Creole language and live mainly on a Colombian archipelago off the coast of Nicaragua.",
