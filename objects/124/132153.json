  "text": "In this 1966 Alton Kelley and Stanley Mouse collaboration, the poster’s central motif features a sinuous young woman with exaggerated swirls of abundant green hair who holds a lighted cigarette in her hand. Designed in 1896 by the Czech art nouveau painter and illustrator, Alphonse Mucha (1860-1939), the motif originally appeared in a series of advertising posters for Job, a French brand of cigarette rolling papers (see Mia P.91.1.8). Kelley and Mouse’s adaption of “Mucha woman” for their Avalon Ballroom concert poster was a not-so-subtle endorsement of recreational drug use. The designers understood that the image was already well known among the era’s counterculture youth, who favored Job cigarette papers to roll their marijuana joints.",
