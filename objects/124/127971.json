  "text": "The Kabuki actor Ichikawa Danjūrō IX (1838–1903) is portrayed as Kezori Kuemon, a real smuggler who became the subject of puppet and Kabuki plays. Kezori is the captain of a Japanese pirate ship and typically wears a Chinese-inspired costume decorated with dragons and jewels. He is depicted here in the moonlight waiting for a boat with illicit goods. Yoshitoshi emphasizes his power by setting his extravagant appearance on a plain background alongside a simple moon disk.",
