  "text": "Yoshida Chizuko positioned the three stars in this print in a vertical column and then colored them. Moving from the lightest value (on the left side of the top star) to the darkest value (on the right side of the bottom star), the eye can feel as though it is weaving in and out around the axis. The colors, although different, are complementary and seem to send out waves of light and energy. This simple, yet sophisticated print won a prize at the 1969 International Print Triennial.",
