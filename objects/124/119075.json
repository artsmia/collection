  "text": "Masayuki began his artistic career in the oil-painting department at Tama Art University in western Tokyo in the early 1980s. But after two years in the painting program, he felt like he didn't have his own sense of expression and turned toward the ceramics program instead. His abstract forms include sky-high monoliths and massive sculptures that span many feet. This work is part of a series from 2013 that somewhat resembles the extraterrestrial creature in the science-fiction horror movie Alien. Prometheus, the fifth installment of this movie franchise, was released the year before Inoue created this work.",
