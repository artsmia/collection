  "text": "Born in Argentina, Santiago Cucullu now lives and works in Milwaukee. He is best known for his vibrant—and sometimes disruptive—murals and multimedia installations that combine historical, political, and cultural references with evocations of the personal and autobiographical. Each of the twelve panels of Architectonic vs. H.R. suggests flashes of memory or historical snapshots, all linked together in a maze of rainbow color. The fragmented imagery is based on Cucullu’s own sketches and photography, which he uses to document things he finds inexplicable or bizarre in everyday life. Cucullu refers to his own work as a “visual mix tape.” For him, autobiography is filtered through collective experience, and memory becomes collage.",
