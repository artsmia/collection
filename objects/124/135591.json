  "text": "Byron Randall was a noted 20th-century American painter, printmaker, and muralist best known for his expressionist figurative paintings and editioned prints. Born and raised in the Pacific Northwest, Randall lived and worked in San Francisco for much of his career. Left wing politics and social activism were central to Randall’s life and practice, though he also produced landscapes, interiors, still lifes, and figurative compositions that were non-political in theme. Reflecting on his lifelong engagement in progressive politics, he once stated: “I think that in time, my (and your) creative effort will overcome the forces of evil that menace peace-loving mankind.”",
