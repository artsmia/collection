  "text": "Wada Akira creates remarkably precise works. At the age of 27, he established his own studio in Chiba, north of Tokyo. Wada uses white porcelain, which he first throws and then meticulously carves to achieve the desired form. The razor-sharp precision he employs is painstaking, resulting in clean lines that make his work appear machine-made. This coolness is further emphasized by the application of a clear glaze. While his works are functional, they read more as sculpture.",
