  "text": "Two boats float on a sea reflecting a darkening sky. The glow of the lowering sun illuminates one, while the shadow of a cloud falls across the other. With powerful brushwork, the artist merges water and clouds in a rhythmic whole, where sea and sky converge in a blur. The sea was a recurring theme for Nolde, who always lived near the water. Nearly ten years before painting <i>Evening Glow</i>, he survived a storm at sea in a small boat and his later paintings reflect his memories of the violent sea and sky.",
