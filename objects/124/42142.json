  "text": "Around 1900, leading artists in Vienna picked up on the Arts and Crafts idea that art should touch every aspect of a citizen’s life. The Viennese magazine Die Graphischen Künste (The Graphic Arts) did its part by sending subscribers a yearly album (1898–1931) of original prints. The 1908 issue contained this woodcut. A native of Karlsbad, Bohemia (now part of the Czech Republic), Walther Klemm worked near Prague before moving to an art colony in Dachau, Germany. He created art from memory to avoid reproducing things too literally.",
