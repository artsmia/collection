  "text": "This is perhaps the most popular design in the series, and one that Vincent van Gogh (1853–1890) admired enough to copy in oils in 1887. It shows people rushing across Ōhashi Bridge to escape a sudden shower. Spanning the Sumida River about a half mile downstream from Ryōgoku Bridge (seen in several prints in this gallery), the Ōhashi Bridge crosses Nakaumi Lake to Ofunagura, which was the shogun’s shipyard. It became known as Atake because the Atake-maru, a pleasure boat for nobles, was moored there until it was dismantled in 1682.",
