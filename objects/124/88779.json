  "text": "On a number of occasions Jack immediately appreciated and understood the potential of a textile already developed by a manufacturer.  When a Japanese mill showed him a light-weight textile with an unusual double-sided pile surface, he realized that with the proper coloring it would add a new dimension to the 1997 collection of Larsen casement fabrics.  Not only was it reversible, but the synthetic fiber was less susceptible to light damage than silk, and the pile surface would help to control extremes of temperature and sound.",
