  "text": "This instrument is properly called a lamellophone, but most people call it something much more evocative: a thumb piano, as its metal keys (the lamelles) are played with the thumbs. Very popular and widespread in traditional Africa, it has been reinvented in urban settings as a large, electronically amplified instrument.",
