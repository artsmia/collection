  "text": "Fired in the open at around 1500°F, Haji ware is unglazed, and so it oxidizes and typically has a reddish-brown tint. The black splotches on this jar occurred during the firing process. Haji ware was in use from around 300 to 900 and is believed to have developed from the wares of the prehistoric Yayoi period.",
