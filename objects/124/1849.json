  "text": "As painter at the papal court, Ghezzi specialized in religious themes, decorative frescoes, landscapes, and theatrical displays. His talents in all these genres are on view in this painting of the New Testament parable of the prodigal son.  The celebration of the errant son’s return home has begun. Instead of dwelling on the story’s moral of repentance and forgiveness, Ghezzi has created a festive genre scene, combining rich colors, warm tonalities, and theatrical lighting with the airy, fresh colors of the landscape and the musicians.",
