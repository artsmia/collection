  "text": "Four men dressed as Moors cower in the corner before a massive elephant. One of the men holds up a book and extends a collar studded with bells in his other hand. This image is part of Goya’s Disperates or Proverbios, dreamlike images that resist firm interpretation. One thought on this image is that the elephant represents the large and powerful public and that the Moors represent the elite who try to control the masses with their laws.",
