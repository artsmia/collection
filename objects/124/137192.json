  "text": "Martin Weinstein has had an extraordinary impact upon the quality and scope of Mia’s photography collection. Possessed of a keenly informed eye and mind, and never without a sense of humor, Martin has offered yet another collection of works to delight and inspire another generation of photography enthusiasts at Mia. Each work could stand alone as a point of departure for research and display; together, they reveal the idiosyncratic discernment of a mind entranced by the long history of a generous medium.",
