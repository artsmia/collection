  "text": "This <I>jue</I> is typical of the late Shang dynasty. The vessel’s large bowl counterbalances the slender, spreading legs. Unusually, the <I>taotie</I> (composite animal) mask around the bowl’s waist is blown open, that is, the mask’s principal components are disconnected, its horns, shield, and C-shaped mouth line are so filled with spirals that they almost merge with the similarly decorated background. The deconstructed <I>taotie</I> was a new fashion, just beginning to appear in the late period of the Shang dynasty. A cow-like animal head decorates the top of the handle, and whorls appear on the tops of the two small posts standing on the rim.",
