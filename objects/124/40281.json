  "text": "As the virtual reality of its day, radio offered a real-time experience of national events, beginning with broadcasts from NBC and CBS in 1926. Families gathered in the evening for news, music, and other entertainment, and adults held “radio parties” to share the excitement of popular shows.\r\n\r\nThe Columaire fit in well with the growing radio culture. Advertised as taking up “only one square foot of floor space, ” Westinghouse’s vertical design captured the energy of skyscrapers while providing superior tonal reception. Flipping on the discreet side controls, listeners were captivated by radio signals traveling through the air as if by magic.",
