  "text": "The agile, curved bodies and long, vertical necks of these ornamental dragons give them a sculptural, dynamic quality. The comma-shaped tails, curling tendrils, and chevron patterns on their moustaches are typical elements of dragon depictions from the Warring States period. The objects would have been attached to a vessel, serving as a kind of stand, so the reverse side of each body has two holes and less decoration—left almost plain since it would have been unseen.",
