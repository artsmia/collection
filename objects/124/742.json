  "text": "Jaguar effigy jars are a classic form of ancient Costa Rican art.  Shaped into the representation of a sun-devouring feline god, the vessel is covered with colorful painted designs that refer not only to the jaguar, but also to celestial elements such as the sun and stars. The legs of these jars were usually hollow, with clay balls inserted to make them rattle.",
