  "text": "The production capabilities of individual workshops sometimes limited Larsen’s ability to maintain stock of a particular pattern. The Italian weavers who first fabricated <I>Diagonal Stripe</I> soon ceased to produce this challenging weave with angled weft alignment. Only after several decades did Larsen find another dependable source, Thai silk weavers, whom the company persuaded to use linen threads because they were more durable for casement fabric construction. The company was able to reintroduce the fabric with a new name, <I>Onward</I>, in 2000.",
