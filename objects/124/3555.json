  "text": "The Eames Storage Units, or ESUs, were a low-cost system of storage and display, available in various combinations of drawers, shelves, or sliding panels. Industrial materials conveyed a modern aesthetic, while brightly colored Masonite, a building material made of pressure-molded wood fibers, added a touch of playfulness to the products. The easily movable ESUs were perfect for modern open-plan homes without built-in storage. However, the delicate steel-angle legs seen on this early example were easily bent—something the manufacturer Herman Miller soon addressed in a redesign.",
