  "text": "Mark, on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you have gathered in the yield of your land…You shall live in booths seven days.\r\n(Leviticus 23:39, 42)\r\n\r\nThe sukkah forms the makeshift harvest dwelling.  Plain on the outside and within, bejeweled with decorations, fruits and the glow of sun during the day and the moon at night.  The family celebrates with lulav, willow, myrtle and ethrog.  A meal of fish is a foretaste of the Great Fish promised in Gan Eden to all the righteous of this world.  Sharing the sukkah are the ancient guests (ushpizin).\r\n\r\nText from The Seven Festivals portfolio",
