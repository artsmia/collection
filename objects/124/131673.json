  "text": "A woman wore this type of garment as a middle layer between her undergarments and her outer kimono. As the collar and sleeves remained visible, these clothes could offer some visual complement or counterpoint to the exterior garment. The tiger-and-bamboo pattern was created using a paper stencil and starch-paste resist technique called katazome. To accomplish it, starch was pushed through the stencil and allowed to dry. When the garment was placed in an indigo bath, those covered areas would remain white.",
