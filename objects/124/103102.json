  "text": "After the Bible, De Imitatione Christi (The Imitation of Christ) ranks among the most popular Christian devotional works ever produced. It offers detailed instructions on spiritual devotion and explanations about Christian doctrine. Although the book was written anonymously between 1418 and 1420, Thomas a Kempis, an Augustinian monk living in the Netherlands, has long been credited as the author. It circulated in manuscript form for some 50 years before being published in Germany in 1471. Since then, well over 2, 000 editions have appeared across the globe. \r\n\r\nThis rare copy was published in Flanders in 1616 for the English market, with the slightly amended title The Following of Christ. The pocket-sized scale made it convenient to carry around. The binding, luxuriously adorned in silver-embroidered red velvet has worn thin from frequent and fervent use, indicating how much its previous owner treasured it.",
