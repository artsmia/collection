  "text": "German artist Moje was the founding director and instructor at the Glass Workshop, Canberra School of Art in Canberra, Australia.  He helped revive murrine (mosaic) glass on a large, painterly scale. Instead of creating vessels, he has concentrated on shallow dish forms or square panels with vivid juxtapositions of color, taking fused glass to another, bolder level, and influencing younger generations working with glass fusing. The saturation of orange and purple secondary colors on a black ground is a fine example of the saturation of color and movement of glass as part of Moje's exploration of fusing, as an open composition spilling off a shallow square dish form.",
