  "text": "The Tale of Usugumo follows a young nobleman who paid frequent visits to the courtesan Usugumo in the New Yoshiwara pleasure quarter. According to the postscript, the scroll once included a note and signature by the courtesan Usugumo herself, hinting at a close connection between her and the scroll owner. This handscroll was significantly damaged in a fire, which resulted in the loss of about one third of the tale’s text and illustrations. The burnt scroll was remounted on a handscroll and decorated with gold flecks.",
