  "text": "Qingbai (bluish-white) is an apt term for a thin, translucent glaze of a faint, bluish tone that deepens where it thickens or collects in intaglio designs. Qingbai porcelains are indigenous to southern China; Jiangxi province was the major source and it is likely that kilns in the vicinity of Jingde Zhen produced the greatest number and best quality.\r\n<P>This eight-paneled ewer is a fine example of Qingbai. The refined, delicacy of potting, subtle blue glaze, provide great aesthetic merit. An ewer of nearly identical size and shape was excavated from a Liao tomb in Zhaoyong city, Liaoning province, dated to about 1004.",
