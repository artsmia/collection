  "text": "As the son of a samurai, Kaioku received a proper Confucian education, but his physical frailty prevented him from becoming a warrior. His aptitude for Chinese studies was so great that he became a central figure in a circle of sinophile literary and artistic scholars in Kyoto during the second quarter of the nineteenth century. Ultimately, Kaioku is more famous for his calligraphy, but he also produced a large number of notable landscape paintings, of which this is one example. Like his other works, it reflects a studied, conservative approach to the Chinese tradition, as well as a reaction against the undisciplined approach of earlier Japanese masters. In the inscription, Kaioku credits the style of Chiang Chai-pu, a visiting Chinese artist, as the source of his inspiration.",
