  "text": "The issue of size has frequently been a factor of how we view art. Historically, large pieces have been created to impress on the viewer the importance of the work as well as the significance of the artist and patron who were responsible for its creation. Mary Bero's work shows that the communication of power is not limited to size. As we see here, within a few square inches meticulously applied embroidery stitches have been made to speak of the bold and dramatic in a most forceful manner.",
