  "text": "This print represents a second method that Rauschenberg devised for transferring existing images onto lithographic stones. In this case, commercial photoscreenprints were prepared from Rauschenberg's own photographs and other images. Lithographic tusche, a liquefied inky substance, was screened directly onto the printing stone, which was then prepared in the normal manner. Front Roll is one of four editioned lithographs that Rauschenberg completed at U.L.A.E. during May-June, 1964.",
