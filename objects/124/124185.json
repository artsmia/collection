  "text": "Pablo Picasso began producing ceramics in 1947 at the Madoura pottery near Nice. There, he discovered a way to create original ceramics in limited editions. Using Picasso's prototypes, Madoura potters would make plaster models. Into these molds, they would press sheets of clay, carefully pull them out, and then form them into vessels of various kinds. The potters would then use glazes to decorate the forms to duplicate Picasso's originals",
