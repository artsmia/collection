  "text": "<span><b>Frank Brangwyn was renowned for the muscular vigor of his etchings, which celebrated industry, architecture, and labor. He approached etching with painterly force, rejecting fin-de-siècle delicacy in favor of broad, energetic lines and rich tonal contrasts. His plates, including <i>Cannon Street Station, Exterior, </i> portray modern London and maritime with monumental grandeur and imperial might. His etchings helped define early-twentieth-century British graphic art, uniting craftsmanship, social consciousness, and the modern city’s dynamic power.</b></span>",
