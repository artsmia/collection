  "text": "During the Edo period, a mania for morning glories emerged that led\r\nenthusiasts to develop many new varieties. Fairs were held throughout\r\nJapan with the most famous at Shingenji Temple in Iriya, northeast of\r\nUeno Park. The depiction of flora and fauna is a classic theme in the\r\nJapanese arts but was relatively rare in Japanese woodblock prints until\r\nthe 1830s, when the market became flooded with designs in various\r\nsizes, mostly by Hokusai and Hiroshige. This print is part of an untitled\r\nseries known as Large Flowers. Seven of the ten designs show animalplant\r\ncombinations like the one seen here, where a small tree frog is\r\nhiding amongst the plants, escaping detection because of his green color\r\nand bent legs that seem to mimic the unique features of the vines.",
