  "text": "Hayashi, a Neo-Confucian teacher and scholar, brushed this composition at a poetry gathering in which participants were assigned a single character on which to base\r\ntheir poem. In this case, Hayashi had the character kyo (emptiness, the same character featured in the work by Suda Kokuta nearby), which appears as the final word of the poem in the lower left corner. Hayashi wrote his characters in clear standard script, attaining a regularity of size and spacing that contrasts with the more condensed and irregular composition of the characters on the right.\r\n\r\n一片晚秋月\r\n四邊殘菊居\r\n時調渾不似\r\n聲裡塵心虛\r\n賦對月彈渾不似\r\n詩 分韻得虛\r\n道春\r\n聲裡塵心虛\r\n\r\nComposed Facing the Moon and Playing a Different Tune\r\nAssigned Xu (emptiness) in the poem rhyme assignment\r\nDōshun\r\nOne sliver of autumn evening moon, The house surrounded by withered chrysanthemums—\r\nSimply unlike the popular melodies of today, An inner voice empties my heart of dust.",
