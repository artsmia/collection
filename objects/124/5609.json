  "text": "Redware decorated with slip patterns was an important part of the English and American folk tradition in ceramics during the 18th and 19th centuries. Light-colored slip (watered-down clay) was painted directly on the red clay body. Feathers and other tools were dragged through the slip to create animated patterns. A resurgence of interest in the slipware tradition occurred during the mid-20th century with ceramists such as the English potter Michael Cardew and the American Ken Ferguson.",
