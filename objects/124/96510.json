  "text": "This rare, imperial bowl is embellished inside and out with auspicious decoration in brilliant underglaze cobalt blue. The exterior is painted with three large carp and a perch among nine other fish and aquatic plants. Fish are an emblem of wealth and abundance because of the similarity in the pronunciation <I>yu</I> meaning fish and another character pronounced <I>yu</I> meaning abundance. The carp is also a symbol of perseverance, a scholarly virtue. The interior of the vessel is decorated with cloud and crane motifs in the bottom and around the rim. These are standard Daoist emblems for long life.",
