  "text": "Painter Siji Krishnan (b. 1983) creates intimate vistas re-imagined from childhood memories, influenced by her village upbringing. ‘Family Portrait- 1’ is a sweeping landscape, with a palpable atmosphere created on layers of paper. As the eye leaps from vignette to vignette, one comes to appreciate the rewards of looking closely. We are confronted with ideas of interdependent relationships--between man, beast, and tree--which define life in rural India, and also re-remember the joys of childhood.",
