  "text": "New Moon Construction, Number 10, is a meditation upon photographic possibility, and the power of the medium to seemingly transform two dimensional spaces into three.  Using vividly colored photographic prints to be mounted, cut, manipulated, and staged for framing, Shirreff creates a photographic montage rooted in abstraction both materially and conceptually.  The play of surfaces, light, and color heighten the object’s material ambiguity—is it a photograph or a sculpture?—while underscoring the elemental allure of its forms.",
