  "text": "Peter van Laer was active in Rome and nicknamed Il Bamboccio or clumsy doll due to his unusual build. Van Laer invented a popular new artistic genre—bambocciata—representing, on a small scale, lowlife scenes set in taverns and on the street of soldiers and blacksmiths fighting or playing cards. Van Laer had many followers in Italy and his prints, of which Two Fighting Horseman is representative, are relatively rare.",
