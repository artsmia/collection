  "text": "Rembrandt used the whiteness of his paper in radical ways, content to suggest form with a simple line or two and let the blank paper do the rest. Here the sketchiness of Christ's face is meant to suggest divine revelation. After he rose from the dead, Christ appeared alongside two disciples who were heading to Emmaus. They didn't recognize him but invited him to supper at an inn. When he broke the bread-in the fashion of the Last Supper-recognition dawned on the disciples. In that instant Christ supposedly vanished, which in Rembrandt's conception has already begun.",
