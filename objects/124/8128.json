In the 15th century, a court painter made the first known painting of this subject. By the early 18th century, a more humorous take on the phrase began to appear in Ōtsu-e, the simple folk paintings that originated in the town of Ōtsu, on Lake Biwa—a monkey hopelessly trying to achieve the impossible.",
