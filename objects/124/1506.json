  "text": "This pair of candelabra were either bought by Frank Totton Heffelfinger of Minneapolis, an avid collector of silver, as a gift for his wife, or given to the couple as a wedding present. They are in the Chrysanthemum pattern, first introduced by Tiffany & Co. in the 1880s from designs by Charles T. Grosjean, superintendent of the silverware production for the firm. This pattern was extremely popular and included flatware as well as monumental pieces such as these candelabra.",
