  "text": "Sally Mann’s photographs are primarily of the landscapes and the people of Virginia, where she was born and still lives today. Her images have been described as a sort of “Southern Gothic,” presenting a melancholic, and troubled aura to many of her landscapes. Influenced by the history of the southern United States, Sally Mann’s photographs aim to capture the past through a contemporary mindset.\r\nThis image is part of her series Deep South (1998). It was made using the Civil War (1861-1865) era technique of a wet-plate collodion process, causing this series to look weathered by time and substance. The photographer also used tea to tone the print. Throughout the series Mann embraced the scrapes and fogged negatives, resulting in a photographic narrative that feels haunted by its past.",
