  "text": "<I>Pomegranate</I> captured the essence of dramatic and highly valued 19th-century Central Asian <I>ikats</I> (fabrics whose yarns are resist-dyed before weaving), which were beginning to appear in Western art galleries. This pattern was introduced as part of the Afghan collection, along with several textiles that Jack Larsen’s visit to Afghanistan in the early 1970s inspired. <I>Pomegranate</I> was discontinued in 1994.",
