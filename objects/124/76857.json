  "text": "The artist Zhang Yin was from Dandu in Jiangsu province. His father, Zhang Qikun, was a well-known collector and painter of birds and flowers. Although Zhang passed his first level exam, he never held office. He was a precocious artist, especially drawn to landscape painting. Zhang modeled himself after Shen Zhou (1427-1509), the founder of the Wu School, and he eventually studied the Song and Yuan masters (10th-14th century) who had inspired Shen Zhou.\r\n<P>Zhang Yin was unwilling to follow the Qing orthodox literati style perpetuated by the Four Wangs. Zhang created his own pictorial style: heavy, dense, and substantial brushwork with themes and motifs derived from the great Song masters. This is particularly fine painting by Zhang, the scholars enjoying the surrounding landscape from a rustic pavilion carries strong Song overtones in both composition and brushwork.",
