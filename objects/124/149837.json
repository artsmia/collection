This painting is the first of a small series of three paintings of the Place de la Bourse. All three are thought to have been preparatory studies for a planned submission to the 1877 Salon, which ultimately did not materialize. Buhot renders the square’s architecture with careful precision, layering washes of muted color to evoke a misty, atmospheric day. The canvas is unfinished and the grid the artist used to map the composition is left visible. The work demonstrates Buhot’s interest in capturing the interplay of urban life and weather, emphasizing line, tone, and mood. Mia has over 150 prints and drawings by Buhot but this is the first painting to enter the collection. </span></b>",
