  "text": "Carlo Sacchi was a prolific painter, working mostly in Pavia, a town just south of Milan. He also tried his hand at printmaking. This image, based on a painting by the great Venetian artist Paolo Veronese, may be his first effort as an etcher. Veronese completed his painting in 1573 as a commission for the Venetian parish church of San Silvestro. The painting was still there when Sacchi studied it, but in the 19th century, the church sold the painting to a dealer who in turn sold it to the National Gallery, London, where it remains today.\r\n\r\nThe Adoration of the Magi is skillfully drawn, but the copper plate was lightly bitten, producing a low-contrast image. Sacchi amplified the delicacy of the image by using a burnishing tool to create the heavenly ray of light beaming down on the scene. The print is dedicated to Giovanni Donato Correggio, a Venetian merchant and significant art patron.",
