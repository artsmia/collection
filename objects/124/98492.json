  "text": "The blue and white geometric design on this large, sleeveless tunic is distinctive of Bamileke ndop cloth. Ndop cloth is a well-known textile in Cameroon with many traditional uses, including men's shirts and skirts, costumes worn by masked dancers, and royal cloths.\r\n\r\nThe red trim and fur (likely goat hair) decorating this tunic may indicate that it was worn by a dancer of the Kuosi, or Elephant Mask Society, an association of powerful men who checked the ruler's authority.",
