  "text": "In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, innovations such as copper plates and metal rollers made it possible to print finely detailed fabric designs that could not be reproduced with the older, block-printing techniques. Printed textiles with imagery ranging from the classical monuments on this bed valance to modern-day heroes became very popular. Besides offering novelty, these new cloths were considerably lighter weight than weave-patterned fabrics and, being made entirely of cotton, were relatively easy to clean.",
