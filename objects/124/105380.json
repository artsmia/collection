  "text": "Conservation was generously funded by Cynthia S. Larsen\r\n\r\nAmong the many highlights of Bruce Dayton's generous 2016 bequest is this painting by Camille Pissarro, the French Impressionist and Post-Impressionist painter. In 1872, the date of this painting, Pissarro established a collective society of fifteen younger artists, becoming the pivotal figure in holding the Impressionist group together. Pissarro is the only artist to have shown his work at all eight Paris Impressionist exhibitions, from 1874 to 1886, and he further acted as a father figure not only to the Impressionists, but to all four of the major Post-Impressionists, including Georges Seurat, Paul Cézanne, Vincent van Gogh and Paul Gauguin.",
