  "text": "Carrie Mae Weems’ visual reckoning with police brutality is staged through the appropriation of Charles Moore’s widely recognized photographs depicting the violence against protestors at the Children’s Crusade of 1963 in Birmingham, Alabama. Reconfiguring several of scenes of violence against Black children and youths engaged in peaceful protest through a dynamic repatterning, Weems’ composition is overlaid with tones of blue and pink to signal her care for the protestors, some of whom were as young as six. The metaphorical content of her titling is equally evocative, carrying associations of bruised skin as well as the color of law enforcement’s uniforms.",
