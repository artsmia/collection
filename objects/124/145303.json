  "text": "Todd Gray’s photographic and sculpture-like collage offers two views, one from a European garden and the other of an African marsh. To Gray, the orderliness of the European setting, with its gridded trellis, is indicative of the supposed orderliness that colonial powers wished to impose upon the areas they conquered. In contrast, the African grassy landscape resists this control.",
