  "text": "Manuel López’s drawings and paintings are informed by a careful examination of elements found in his immediate environment--his home, his studio, his neighborhood--thus capturing the vitality and beauty of the everyday. López relies on observation, memories, materiality, and presence to evoke a feeling of familiarity in his compositions. Here, Lopez reveals a glimpse of his Los Angeles studio, a personal space containing an assortment of furnishings that includes a bent wood chair draped with a Mexican-style blanket, a metal stepladder, art materials, and a low table on which rests two books, a beverage bottle, and other items. Though it appears informal, the scene functions as an elaborate still life composition, drawing the viewer's attention to details of form, color, contrast, texture, perspective, and design. By presenting familiar objects within a mundane setting, Lopez invites viewers to use their own perceptions, memories, and experiences to generate meaning.",
