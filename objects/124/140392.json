So the big reveal of the recordings that confirm a willful deception that lead to thousands of deaths is not terribly explosive. The new lie is that we were deceived “to prevent panic.” Meanwhile the wildfires set off by a gender reveal party rage in California. Is it too late to really panic?</i>",
