  "text": "Claire Zeisler used color selectively, preferring to work with natural undyed fibers and occasionally employing a signature red, as seen in Clove Lace nearby. With its vibrant hues of orange, yellow, and purple, Buddy Balls was a clear departure from Zeisler’s palette. The work also poses questions about the medium of fiber art, which often foregrounds technical skill in weaving. These nonwoven bundles of wool redirect the discussion to the importance of color and volume.",
