  "text": "A tightly arranged group of boxes and vases sit on a table top represented only by a single line. Giorgio Morandi experimented with light and shadow falling across simple, geometric forms to create an abstract pattern. This work is characteristic of the still-life subjects that Morandi produced obsessively for more than forty years in his apartment in Bologna, Italy. His is an art of calm restraint in contrast to the other more flamboyant developments of modern art.",
