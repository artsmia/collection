  "text": "This Daoist priest’s robe is embroidered with the Eight Precious Things, auspicious symbols representing wisdom, prosperity, and spiritual power. The motifs appear in eight large medallions—three on the front, three on the back, and one on each sleeve. The faded, rust-colored satin ground is enriched with a meandering gold-thread pattern. Additional decorative elements include bats and double peaches, symbols of longevity and good fortune, worked in satin stitch with shades of coral, peach, and blue. Rich in meaning and visual harmony, the robe embodies the ritual and cosmological ideals of late 18th- to early 19th-century Daoist practice.",
