  "text": "Tulip-shaped goblets came into fashion in the Netherlands without delay when these flowers were planted there systematically, and became fashionable to a degree that an investment-rally into tulips followed. The so-called Dutch 'Tulip mania' is the first recorded financial bubble documented in economic history—until it burst in 1637. Dutch glassblowers adapted the most sophistical and avant-garde glass techniques known from Murano, such as the white, vertical 'latticinio' threads, which together with the horizontal bulges create a sophisticated an highly abstract scheme.",
