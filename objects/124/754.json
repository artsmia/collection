  "text": "Although Nayarit sculptors are better known for their small-scale ceramics, they also created large hollow figures. This impressive example represents a woman. She is shown holding a vessel for food or drink and wears a patterned headband, skirt, and elaborate jewelry. It was likely produced as part of a pair depicting a man and a woman. Couple figures in Nayarit, Jalisco, and Colima art from West Mexico were likely more than just marriage pairs. Placed in deep shaft tombs, they may also have represented the ancestors of the deceased to watch over and care for the spirits of the departed. The living felt strong ties to their deceased relatives and wanted to make sure they were well cared for.",
