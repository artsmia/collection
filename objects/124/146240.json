  "text": "Fujikasa Satoko captured the airiness of clouds and wind in ceramic form in her most recent series inspired by the supercell, a type of severe thunderstorm that can lead to tornadoes. This work represents the core of the storm: a towering cumulonimbus cloud fanned by a deep, rotating updraft called a mesocyclone. Despite the variety in precipitation in Japan, supercells are relatively uncommon there. Fujikasa learned about them from television and was struck by their duality of serenity and destruction. To her, the variability of weather mirrored the turbulence of life, especially as she balanced her roles as artist and new mother amid the COVID-19 pandemic.",
