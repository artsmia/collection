  "text": "In the early 1900s, many Euro-American women traveling through the Southwest region of the United States became infatuated with miniature Native American baskets, and some became avid collectors. Native women basket makers responded to this demand by creating ever-smaller baskets, utilizing the same harvesting, processing, and coiling techniques as those for personal use. Creating tightly woven, tiny baskets in an expanding range of designs and styles for their new clientele required the same levels of expertise and knowledge—but perhaps even more dexterity and skill.",
