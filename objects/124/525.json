  "text": "Symbolic of good wishes to the Chinese, the <I>ruyi</I> (literally as you wish) is a scepter-like object first encountered in Buddhist art. Perhaps by virtue of its auspicious name, it became a favorite motif in the decorative arts of the Qing dynasty. Placed on a writing desk, display shelf, or held in the hand, most of these scepters display the auspicious symbols which were common to the 18th and 19th centuries. Also typical of the period is the variety of materials used including gold, jade, carved lacquer, cloisonné, porcelain, bronze, and boxwood.",
