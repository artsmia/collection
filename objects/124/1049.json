  "text": "During the Eastern Zhou period, jade dragons were highly stylized, with a focus on fluidity, symmetry, and balance. This example highlights an innovation in Eastern Zhou decorative techniques, as one end of the dragon’s body is carved in the same curved shape as the other. It is decorated with the so-called “grain pattern, ” composed of spiral shapes in relief. These spirals reference the shape of sprouting grains, a symbol of fertility and good harvest. This was a common decorative element in dragon ornaments of this time and the succeeding Han dynasty.",
