  "text": "Designers use many tools to develop initial ideas. Win Anderson and the Larsen Design Studio were well-known for their hands-on approach and willingness to experiment. While she was in Swaziland in South Africa, she visited a small weaving studio that worked with particularly lustrous mohair wool. She returned to New York with a variety of yarn samples. Dying the wool in colors that would harmonize with the Larsen palette she experimented with yarn textures and sizes in the simple structures that the Swazi weavers could produce. The archive contains many samples, some of which were not successful, but provided inspiration for future experimentation.  \r\n\r\nActivate the LCD screen under the gallery's didactic panel to learn more about the design tools and philosophy of the Larsen Design Studio.",
