  "text": "From the late 1940s until the 1960s, Cameron Booth worked as an abstract expressionist, creating colorful nonrepresentational paintings. He began and ended his career, however, with scenes of rural life based on his experiences living in Minnesota. Many of those works show his lifelong appreciation for the power and beauty of horses. In 1933, Booth made a series of drypoints on the sport of polo, including this dynamic horse and rider in mid-match, pursuing the ball as a synchronized unit.",
