  "text": "The photographer Cara Romero links “fun, fantasy and hope.” Here, the artist George Alexander (Mvskoke Creek) seems to float as if in space, suspended between ears of indigenous white corn and the stars. While playful, to Romero, the work also addresses the future of foodways. Though “life and culture is always changing, ” Romero notes, “we take our past with us.”",
