  "text": "Algernon Newton first achieved success in the 1920s with his uncanny paintings of the empty streets of London, which emphasize the alienation and anxiety that followed World War I. He also painted “portraits” of English country houses. Godmersham Park was once owned by Edward Austen, the brother of the writer Jane Austen (1775–1817), who traveled there often; her novel Mansfield Park is thought to be inspired by Godmersham. In this portrait, Newton pictures the house a distance beneath an expansive sky darkened by fast-moving clouds. One of the three figures appears in military uniform, alluding to the use of historic country houses as hospitals during the catastrophic bombing campaigns of World War II. A combat veteran himself, Newton’s paintings from this period are filled with foreboding and the sense of a world teetering on the edge of violence and dislocation.",
