  "text": "Kitaōji Rosanjin had already earned a reputation as a talented calligrapher when he became famous for his ceramics, which revived a variety of Japanese, Korean, and Chinese styles.  His versatility and ability to quote different styles without being derivative set him apart from other modern potters. A scholar of antique pottery and a gourmand, Rosanjin opened an art gallery and dining club in Tokyo, and in 1925 he built his own kiln in order to produce his own tableware. Rosanjin is one of the most influential and best known Japanese ceramicists of the early 20th century.",
