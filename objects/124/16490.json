  "text": "The exact role of this garment is unclear, but its colorful nature and lack of religious decoration suggest it may have been intended for a female character at a special occasion. In fact, as the collar is wider and more elaborate than more traditional collars on women’s robes at the time, the character wearing it may have been Tibetan or connected to Tibet in some way.",
