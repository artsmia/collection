  "text": "This youthful satyr, once part of a complex group, sits on a blocky base and turns his head and body sharply to his right. The remains of his right thigh show that the leg was extended for additional support.\r\n<P>The satyr's general pose, his expression, and the fragmentary hand at the back of his head recall elements of a Hellenistic <I>symplegma</I>, or erotic group. This type of sculptural group involved members of the Dionysian entourage in compositions of closely intertwined limbs and physical struggles.",
