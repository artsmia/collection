  "text": "Born in Jakarta, Indonesia, Diyan Achjadi (they/she) spent their formative years moving between various educational, political, and cultural systems in Jakarta, Hong Kong, London, and Washington, D.C., before moving to New York City for ten years. As a result, Achjadi has developed what she describes as an interest in “different perceptions of the world.” For the mixed media painting Back and Forth, part of the artist's series Creature Drawings (2015-16), Achjadi created a multilayered scene of vivid colors and patterns featuring fantastical non-human characters. Commenting on their approach, Achjadi explains: “I often start with a response to a story, a gesture, or an image, and I rarely know what the end result of the work will be. I come to the work with hope that the curiosity that propels my work, the evidence of the investment of time and labor, and open-endedness of my approach allows for multiple points of entry for someone encountering my work; that even if my specific references are not familiar to someone, the combination of images, patterns, marks, forms, titles, invite curiosity, questions, and engagement.”",
