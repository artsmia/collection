  "text": "These two chasubles, or outermost liturgical vestments, depict the wealth and importance of the Catholic church in Europe at this time, and by extension, the power of the clergy who wore them to celebrate the Eucharist. Just as the church spared no expense in the decoration of interiors with important paintings and sculpture, it outfitted celebrants with chasubles that would draw attention to the miracle of the Mass. This Italian chasuble is embroidered in gold and other colors with C-scrolls, trellis patterns, and reserves to contain images, all typical of high-style Rococo decoration found on contemporary furniture, ceramics, and silver. The French chasuble, shown nearby also features Rococo scrolls, flowers, grapes referring to the Eucharist, and trellis patterns in metallic thread, making it also an example of high-style (and heavy) textile decoration.",
