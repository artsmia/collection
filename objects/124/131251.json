  "text": "In this series, artist Kenji Nakahashi considers the fluid nature of time, defining it as a series of approximations or estimates made increasingly absurd by his efforts to measure it. Using scales, signs, and other comparative material to assert the “time” depicted on each clock, Nakahashi conveys the impossibility of capturing time, or even fixing a moment in memory.",
