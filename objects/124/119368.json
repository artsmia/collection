  "text": "For Steven Sorman, drawing demands an orchestration of diverse processes and media. His multifaceted approach blends rich color, sinuous lines, fluid shapes, and an instinctive sense of compositional rhythm to create abstractions that are unabashedly ornamental and visually alluring. He often employs collage techniques to emphasize the materiality and surface qualities of his mixed-media drawings, such as integrating fine Japanese and handmade papers as organizational elements. Despite their complexity, his drawings possess an aesthetic and compositional harmony that often expresses a sense of serenity, allowing the eye and mind to experience form, color, and material independent of narrative or representation.",
