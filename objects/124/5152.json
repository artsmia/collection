  "text": "Used to support a painter's or calligrapher's wrist while doing meticulous brushwork, wrist rests became popular in the 17th century as literati accoutrements. Though often made of bamboo, examples in boxwood, jade and ivory have also survived. The carved decoration here features herons in a lotus pond. The signature and seals at the end of the poem cite Ping Ts'un as the carver. The use of natural materials and the inclusion of a poem complementing the scene clearly reflect literati values.",
