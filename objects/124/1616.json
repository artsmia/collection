  "text": "Like their neighboring Nayarit and Colima cultures, the Jalisco had a tradition of sculpting male-female pairs. The exact nature of this couple's animated interaction is not certain but has been interpreted variously as singing, talking, or embracing. Their headdresses, earrings, nose ornaments, armbands, and the scarification on their cheeks are likely indicators of their elevated status in Jalisco society.",
