  "text": "This richly decorated special occasion gown features a scattered scheme of flowers and animals. Peonies, orchids, plum and peach blossoms, magnolia, lotus, chrysanthemum, and morning glory flowers combine with cicadas against a green background. The cuffs feature sprays of multicolored seasonal flowers while the inner cuff bands and borders display crane roundels alternating with bats (representing happiness) against a dark blue ground. This robe symbolizes the classic Chinese ideal of harmony with nature. The floral imagery represents seasonal change with the specific flowers signifying different months of the year. The cicada, which emerges in spring to complete its life cycle, suggests renewal and regeneration. Together, the insects and flower promote the ideal of a harmonious coexistence of all living things.",
