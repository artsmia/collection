  "text": "The Nivkh people were hunters and fishermen who lived on the northern half of Sakhalin and in the Amur River region in the Russian Far East. Harvesting materials available to them in the region, they turned to the skin of chum salmon or Amur carp to make clothing and shelter. The skin is removed in one piece and then dried, kneaded, and moistened in fish soup until supple. The result is a lightweight material that is also water and wind repellent and durable. These women’s festival coats (hukht) show a style reminiscent of neighboring Chinese and Manchu robes. Especially the backs are richly decorated with appliqué and embroidery of abstracted, animalistic designs that represent masks, birds, serpents, and dragons which design is also of Chinese origin.",
