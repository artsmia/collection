Johnson painted this seascape while living in Denmark with his wife, artist Holcha Krake. Born in South Carolina, Johnson studied in New York before traveling to France and later Denmark, where he eventually settled in the coastal town of Kerteminde. There, he created land and cityscapes in a dynamic expressionist style characterized by thick brushwork and saturated colors. Here, swirling waves crash against a curving shoreline beneath an overcast sky. The painting captures both the drama of the eastern Danish coast–a popular destination for many artists of the time–as well as Johnson’s emerging sensibility as an artist. Johnson eventually returned to the United States, where he played an important role as an instructor at the Harlem Community Art Center, a key center for African American artists working in New York City. </span></b>",
