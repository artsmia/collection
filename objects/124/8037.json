  "text": "The size of this mask is highly unusual. Unlikely to have been worn, it is probably a 'family mask' that was hung on the wall to protect the household. The four little pouches above the forehead are protective talismans. Characteristic of many Dan masks is the high forehead split by a vertical ridge, and the angle at eye level. The holes in the upper lip contained wooden or metal teeth.",
