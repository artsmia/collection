  "text": "Of typical Safavid (1502-1722) shape, this cylindrical, brass candlestick is embellished with geometric ground patterns, arabesques, and bands of poetic <I>nasta'liq</I> script in silver inlay. While the surface decoration of Safavid metalwork owes much to earlier Timurud (c. 1375-1500) styles, the shape of this tall, cylindrical candlestick was a Safavid development. Candleholders of this size were commonly used in mosques. Although they produced functional objects, the technical virtuosity and refined aesthetics of the Persian metalworkers have transformed the most useful items into works of art.",
