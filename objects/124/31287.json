  "text": "Qi Baishi, one of modern China’s most celebrated painters, was renowned for transforming everyday subjects into vivid, poetic imagery. This fan painting of a lotus captures his bold style: broad, expressive ink washes form dark leaves, while brilliant red blossoms burst forth. The contrast between dynamic brushwork and luminous color is a perfect example of Qi’s unique fusion of tradition and innovation. Rooted in literati (scholar-artist) painting yet infused with a fresh, relaxed spirit, his work embodies both simplicity and profound insight. In this fan, the lotus—long a symbol of purity—becomes a striking emblem of renewal, resilience, and artistic vitality.",
