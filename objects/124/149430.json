  "text": "<font face=Times New Roman size=3>  </font>\n<p>\n\t<font face=Arial><font size=3><span lang=EN>Albrecht Dürer’s ”Four books on human proportion” are the culmination of his long years of methodical study and became an important handbook for artists. With the support of many woodcut diagrams, </span>Dürer argues that correct form stems from primary mathematical figures—line, circle, conic—constructed arithmetically or geometrically and made beautiful by proportion. Yet beauty is relative, so his anthropometry lets artists delineate all human types by exact measurement. Books I–II set proportions for stout, medium, and lean adults, and for infants. Book III explains how to modify bodily and facial proportions by mathematical rules. Book IV treats the body’s movement in space and, with unusual rigor, advances descriptive spatial geometry. <span lang=EN>Dürer wrote, illustrated, and designed the work. This example is from the first edition, published in 1528, by his widow, Agnes Dürer (1475-1539), shortly after his death.</span></font></font>\n</p>",
