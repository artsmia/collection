They are now in the Museo di Capodimonte, Naples (A. Filangieri di Candida, ” in Venturi 1902, pp.249, 340n147). As the series remained intact until at least 1769, it is possible Oberto owned the whole Vouet series at some point, including the Mia paintings.",

  "text": "<p>This angel carries symbols of the Passion—the events associated with Jesus Christ’s suffering and death. The pitcher, basin, and cloth represent those used by Pontius Pilate to wash his hands of responsibility for Christ’s crucifixion.The painting belongs to a series of twelve angels carrying symbols of the Passion, which were painted for a private patron in Rome, Ascanio Filomarino, later appointed a cardinal of the Church and archbishop of Naples.</p><p>Simon Vouet was one of the most important painters of his generation in France, ultimately serving as First Painter to King Louis XIII. From 1612 to 1627, he worked in Rome. These angels were among the last works he painted there, completed just months before his return to France. In Paris, he helped introduce French artists to the Baroque style: high drama, rich color, intense light, and dark shadows.</p>",
