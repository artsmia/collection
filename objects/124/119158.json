  "text": "For this sculpture, Matsushima explored a coiling technique she learned in Myanmar that was originally used in crafting offering bowls and other vessels. She coiled split bamboo strips into the desired form and soaked the object in lacquer to bond the strips. She then cut and sanded it before applying thin layers of lacquer to the outside.",
