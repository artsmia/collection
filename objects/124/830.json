  "text": "Toward the mid–Western Zhou, two of the most noticeable changes that occurred in bronze casting involved the abandonment of the <I>taotie</I> (composite animal) mask motif and the adoption of long inscriptions. This <I>gui</I> displays elaborate birds, a popular motif, on its main decorative register. The birds’ flamboyant design, with their crests and peacock-like plumage, is unique. The lengthy inscription, neatly cast into the cauldron’s bottom, reads as follows: \r\n\r\n<P><I>Zhou King went out to attack Laiyu, then Naohei. Upon his return after victory, he held a liao sacrifice [burnt offering] at the capital Zongzhou [at present-day Xi’an]. He presented to me, X, Duke of Yong, ten strings of cowries [one hundred pieces]. In response, to extol the king’s grace, I have made this precious gui, dedicating it to ancestors. May sons and grandsons forever treasure and use it.</I>",
