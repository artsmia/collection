  "text": "The Man of Sorrows surrounded by instruments of the Passion was a \r\nparticularly potent stimulus to prayer. These instruments, called the arma \r\nChristi, were visual cues to help the beholder reconstruct the Passion from \r\nmemory. By the late 1400s, new symbols were added to the traditional cross, lance, nails, and crown of thorns to help people relive each torment. \r\nIncluded here are the pincers used to remove the nails from the cross, the \r\nvinegar-soaked sponge, the die used in casting lots for Christ's garment, and sixteen of the pieces of silver given to Judas for betraying Christ.",
