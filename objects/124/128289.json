  "text": "Abe Anjin, from Osaka, was not born into a potter family. He originally was a painter, and had his first exhibition in 1967. In the 1970s, he started to be engaged in ceramics and in 1989 built his own kiln in Okayama. Abe has a deep fascination with antiquity and traditional forms, and this uneven, asymmetrical water container (mizusashi) resembles Mia’s most celebrated antique ceramic, the “Burst Bag (yaburebukuro) water container from around 1600, on view in gallery 224.",
