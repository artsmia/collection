  "text": "Today, Vierthaler is best known for the extraordinary colorations found in his copperware which create an atmospheric backdrop for surface elements based on underwater plant and sealife forms. In this aquatic scene, a crab-like creature occupies one side while the arms of another curl around the opposite edge, leaving the center free for the artist's famous painterly effects. Winhardt & Co.'s patinations were sold under the registered trademark EOSIN, but it was Vierthaler who created them.",
