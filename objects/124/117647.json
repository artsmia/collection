  "text": "In 1970, Yoshida Hodaka began his landscape prints, drawing inspiration from pop art. In Japan, he was a pioneer of photo montages and had combined lithographs, silkscreen, and zinc relief with photo transfer techniques since 1966 in his mythology prints. His landscapes are intended to portray the devastating effects that pollution has on the environment. To achieve this, he cut pictures from magazines and assembled them as a collage, which he then photographed. The final image was created using a photoetched zinc plate inked in black for the detailed linework, while color was added through the use of woodblocks.",
