  "text": "In the prints from the “Black Dada” portfolio (Mia 2018.123.4.1-.14), German artist and musician Thomas Zipp uses photomontage to alter a photograph of Otto Hahn, a German scientist whose research led to the development of the atomic bomb. For the final print in the portfolio, Zipp portrays Hahn partially shrouded by fragments of text from the Aeneid, Virgil’s ancient epic poem concerning the founding of Rome by Aeneus, whose fate was governed both by free will and destiny. The image symbolizes the eclipsing of Hahn’s perceived scientific progress by unanticipated outcomes and the inevitable deterioration of society.",
