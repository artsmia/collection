  "text": "Georges Hugnet was a surrealist poet, playwright, art critic, and graphic artist who loved to create images from other images, clipping printed photographs and illustrations from magazines and newspapers of the day and reassembling them into photo-collages. But far from reinforcing each other, the images are corrupted and no longer describe reality: hats become heads, a doorway becomes a body. The towering termite mound is equally disconcerting. Like a dream, the assembled image thwarts any attempt at rational perception and understanding—a definition of surrealism.",
