  "text": "According to Catholic belief, performing the Eucharist – the sacrament of Holy Communion in the Christian faith – transforms the wine from the Eucharistic chalice into the blood of Christ. Christian theologians have historically disputed whether the ritual of consecration physically transforms the wine into Christ’s blood, or if Christ is only symbolically present. Schiller’s <i>Eucharistic Chalice</i> is decorated with the scene of the crucifixion, acting as a visual reminder of the spilled blood of Christ contained within the chalice.",
