  "text": "A man would have worn this kimono while performing folk dances at Obon festivals held in honor of the spirits of his ancestors. A large family crest on the upper back, representing a stylized tachibana orange, underlines the focus on family identity and connections to relatives both living and dead.  \r\nThe large-scale motif must have been made custom order for a special occasion because the combination of pine, bamboo, and cherry blossoms is very unusual. Typically pine and bamboo are joined by plum blossoms to create the so-called Three Friends of Winter (shōchikubai) motif, representing longevity and happiness. Here, the addition of cherry blossoms speaks to the beauty and fragility of life",
