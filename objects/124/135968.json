  "text": "Yoshida Hodaka first encountered the ancient Mayan pyramids, with their grand stairways and friezes depicting gods and heroes, during his 1955 journey to Mexico. This print evokes the style of pre-Columbian bas-reliefs, though Hodaka’s figures are not overtly human. Their forms resemble carved stone, with hollow circles suggesting eyes or mouths and short protrusions hinting at limbs. The leftmost figure drives a lance into the adjacent form, whose head is shaped like a comma. Another comma-headed figure is being led away by a fourth, more upright form. Though abstract, the composition conveys a powerful narrative of violence, control, and subjugation.",
