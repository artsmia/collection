  "text": "Arthur Amiotte is a Plains artist who was influenced by artists Oscar Howe and Robert Rauschenberg. Here he illuminates the complex relationship of Native people with American marketing. Juxtaposing the advertising text: “…tobacco that’s got red-blood-man-punch!” and the appropriated image of Chief Joseph, Amiotte illustrates the line Natives walk between appropriation and insult. Extending the irony, Amiotte’s great-grandfather, Standing Bear, who toured England with Buffalo Bill’s Wild West show and performed for Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, sits resignedly, in the right hand corner on some Bull Durham labels.",
