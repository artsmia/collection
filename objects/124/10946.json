  "text": "Drawn by scientific subjects, Stuart D. Klipper traveled to several research facilities between 1979 and 1980, making thousands of photographs. He carried three cameras with him, later combining the images based on an algorithm he designed. At the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory in Livermore, California, he focused on an outdoor space. The Mirror Fusion Facility, despite its name, did not in fact research and develop traditional mirrors made of glass and silver or metal. Rather, mirror technology was based on the interaction of electromagnets, each strong enough to prompt electrons to bounce, much like reflections do from mirrors many of us encounter daily.",
