  "text": "In 1978, while still producing vessels adorned with parallel blue, white, and yellow enamel bands against a light gray clay body, Kamoda also created a series of works using a different palette of enamels and staggering the ends of the bands so that they resemble rays of light. Sometimes he heightened the drama by painting the vessel with a dark glaze, as seen with this vessel. At other times, he applied the jewel-like enamels directly on the rough, unglazed clay.",
