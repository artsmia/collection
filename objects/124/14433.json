  "text": "A group of young boys play a game outside, possibly blindman’s buff. The children’s smiling faces and brightly colored clothes, along with the auspicious symbolism of “boys at play, ” communicate joy and liveliness. The artist used the “inside painting” technique to create this scene, employing a tiny brush to paint the image in reverse on the inside of the bottle through its small opening, so that the image shows through the glass.",
