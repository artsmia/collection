  "text": "Many of NUNO's designers have achieved the company's distinctive aesthetic through the use of treatments applied to the fabric after it is removed from the loom.  In this case the textile was subjected to diverse temperatures and abrasion in order to contract and felt the untwisted wool yarns. The resulting grid and the rippled effect of the nylon ground fabric reference the appearance of window frames.",
