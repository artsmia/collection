  "text": "In the late eighteenth century, woven textile designs shifted from the large, elaborate patterns of the Rococo style to the more restrained taste of the Neo-Classical style. Sprays of small flowers accompany thin bands of <I>rocaille</I> (shell encrusted or pebbly) motifs, woven with gold and silver, as well as multi-colored threads.\r\n\r\nThis panel may have been part of a furniture fabric for a matched set of chairs and sofas used in an elegant French reception room.",
