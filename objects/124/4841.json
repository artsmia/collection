  "text": "This desk’s Indian makers used British pattern books as a guide. These forms suited their elite British market, including colonial officials. \r\nIt incorporates local materials that were plentiful to Indian craftsmen in the 18th-century, but today they are scarce. The ebony for the stand and the rosewood of the desk were once abundant in southern India, as was elephant ivory, in widespread use for architectural woodwork decoration in southern India. All three materials are now either endangered or threatened.",
