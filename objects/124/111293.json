  "text": "Ellsworth Kelly distills the observed and experienced world into abstracted forms or fragments. He articulates these reductive geometric forms in sculpture, paintings, and prints, by emphasizing their physical and material qualities—size, shape, color, mass, edges, and surface texture. The result, as seen in this color lithograph, is elegant in its simplicity and conceptual refinement. A prolific printmaker, Kelly has produced more than 300 editioned prints during his career.",
