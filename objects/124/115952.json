  "text": "Over the last forty years Dailey has been deeply involved in the world of studio glass. His foundation of the Glass Department of the Massachusetts College of Art in 1972 is only one of his many contributions to art glass education. He has also designed for companies such as Steuben Glass, Cristallerie Daum, and Fenton Art Glass Company and in countries from Italy to the United States. Whimsy and narrative--along with glass innovation--form important components of his work. This engraved covered jar references Art Deco engraved glass from Orrefors in Sweden, but the subject matter is wholly contemporary.",
