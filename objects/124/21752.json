  "text": "This pair of classical-style bronze statuettes represent vestal virgins, ancient Roman priestesses dedicated to Vesta, the goddess of hearth and home. Their primary job was keeping the temple altar fire burning. For their service, they were granted exceptional privileges, but their sacred duties required strict chastity. Vestals who broke this sacred vow were buried alive. While this was a rare occurrence in antiquity, the popularity of the subject in neoclassical art suggests that the lurid peril captivated the imaginations of artists and collectors of the period.",
