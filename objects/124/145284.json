  "text": "As Minneapolis and the world mourned the murder of George Floyd in the summer of 2020, an outpouring of art was created by artists, professional and amateur alike—murals, sidewalk art, sculpture installations, cardboard signs, paintings, drawings, and prints. The works were made to memorialize Floyd and countless other Black citizens martyred in this country, to protest racial injustice and police brutality, and to try to help communities heal. Barthold, a New York printmaker and street artist, completed portrait prints of Floyd and other important Americans—John Lewis, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and this portrait of the late political activist and Black Panther Party leader Fred Hampton—to, in the artist’s words, “remember the lost and honor the living.” Barthold mass-produced these likenesses and pasted them around the city of New York throughout the summer of 2020, and, again, in a campaign just before the 2020 election. To broaden their reach, he shared the images on social media, and sold the prints online, using the proceeds to raise funds for Black Lives Matter and the Bail Project social justice initiatives.",
