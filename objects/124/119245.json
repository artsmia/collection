  "text": "Umbrico created Mountains, Moving---Slide Show of National Archives Scan, Ansel Adams, at a moment of intense, critical conversation around technology and consumer impact on the larger photography field. Kodak Eastman Company alongside others like Polaroid, declared bankruptcy (2012) due to the rapid decline of analog film cameras and rapid rise of digital photography, social media, and smartphones.\r\n\r\nThe slideshow concentrates on a singular photograph of a mountain taken by Ansel Adams (American 1902-1984), whose intention it was to make his negatives and prints available to photography students. Adams was a ardent teacher who believed that the technology used to capture and process the physical photograph mattered as much as the image itself. For this work, Umbrico processed the image through 526 filters of 27 smart-phone camera apps. The result is a hauntingly synthetic time-lapse---everything about the images change except the mountain's form remains ever-present.",
