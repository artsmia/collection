The flame flame-like form above the central sister’s hand may stand for their devotion to the “Sacred Heart, ” in which the flaming heart of Jesus symbolizes his physical sacrifice for humanity.\r\n\r\nHelen Blair-Crosbie is primarily known as a sculptor, but here she works in the sculptural technique of linocut in which the artist carves the printing blocks to leave the image raised in relief.",
