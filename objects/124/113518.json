  "text": "Wakimoto Hiroyuki is the most represented artist in this exhibition, with nine objects on display. Wakimoto has expanded Bizen pottery significantly through the wide range of non-traditional forms he creates. This case presents three functional objects by him that have strong, red line marks resembling cord bands—called hidasuki in Japanese. The effect is achieved by tying straw to the objects before firing, which then ignites and reacts with the clay body to leave these distinguishing reddish effects.",
