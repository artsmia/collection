  "text": "St. Paul native Alexis Jean Fournier painted a series of six views of Minneapolis in the summer of 1888, three of which are in Mia’s collection. The area known as Lowry Hill was named for Thomas Lowry, a Minneapolis lawyer, real estate investor, and streetcar company owner of the late 1800s. The Hill was home to some of the wealthiest people in Minneapolis, and some houses built in Fournier’s time still stand. Today, the Hill is bounded on the north and west by interstate highways.",
