  "text": "This small box is decorated with a delicate design of blossoming chrysanthemums, emblematic of autumn. The artist's sparing use of iridescent mother-of-pearl is typical of lacquers produced during the 16th century in Japan. While the original use of this box is not known, such boxes were typically used to store cosmetics or incense.",
