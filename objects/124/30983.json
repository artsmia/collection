  "text": "Dong Qichang, a leading Ming dynasty painter, calligrapher, and theorist, profoundly shaped the course of Chinese landscape painting. This delicate fan painting exemplifies Dong Qichang’s mastery of literati (scholar-artist) landscape. With swift, calligraphic brushstrokes, he evoked mist-shrouded mountains, clustered pines, and winding paths that invite the viewer into an imagined retreat. Dong emphasized expressive brushwork over naturalistic detail  . The painting  underscores the intimate scale and poetic mood, allowing nature to unfold in the palm of one’s hand. Through restrained ink tones, Dong transformed a simple object into a meditation on harmony, elegance, and the scholar’s inner world.",
