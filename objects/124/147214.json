  "text": "Having studied in Amsterdam and Paris, Dutch painter Leo Gestel was interested in international avant-garde artistic movements. He delved into Divisionism, Fauvism, Cubism, and Expressionism. At times he dealt with major events, such as the displacement of refugees during World War I, but more often he depicted everyday life.\r\n\r\nGestel drew this small lithograph of the Bavarian city of Regensburg in an angular style. Much of the view is quite recognizable, since Regensburg was relatively unscathed in World War II. In the foreground is the city's 12th-century stone bridge.  The church with two tall towers is Saint Peter's Cathedral. The angular drawing and accentuated rays of light recall the work of the German painter/printmaker Lyonel Feininger.",
