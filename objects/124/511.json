  "text": "Hand-built from common clay, this straightforward utilitarian  cord marked tripod, like its Neolithic predecessors, was designed to expose a large surface to the cooking fire. At this early point in time, bronze ceremonial vessels were being influenced by Neolithic ceramic shapes such as this one. The situation would soon reverse itself, however, and by the late Bronze Age a majority of ceremonial ceramics were made in imitation of more expensive bronze vessels.",
