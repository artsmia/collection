  "text": "The “Visiting Kawachi” episode of the classical <I>Tales of Ise</I> tells the story of a mistreated wife whose husband leaves her night after night to visit a mistress. Though aware of his trespasses, the wife nevertheless remains silent, so much so that the philandering husband himself becomes suspicious of her. One night, the man pretends to set out as usual to visit his mistress, but instead hides in bushes nearby to spy on his wife. Unaware of his presence, she steps onto the veranda and recites a poem:\r\n\r\n<I>When the winds blow, White waves rise high at Tatsutayama.\r\nShall you be crossing the river\r\nQuite alone by night?</I>",
