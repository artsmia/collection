  "text": "Although the geographic origin of this panel is unknown, it has been suggested that it may have been manufactured in France from an English design. The pattern appears to be a hybrid, combining a William Morris-style floral treatment with the graceful, undulating lines of Art Nouveau. The depiction of the flowers suggests the simplified, two-dimensional treatment of Arts and Crafts style, while the emphasis on leaves and stems is reminiscent of French Art Nouveau. The highly stylized ornamentation characteristic of Art Nouveau never captured the imagination of English artists and designers, who continued to develop the Arts and Crafts aesthetic in the first decade of the twentieth century.",
