  "text": "In Edo period Japan, publishers printed books in a variety of sizes, from extra-large to miniature. The size depended on how a large piece of paper could be divided. This type\r\nof tiny book was called a keshibon (mustard-seed book) because of its portable size. This book depicts men of 19 different professions, ranging from textile sellers to fan\r\nmakers to carpenters, showing workers who were familiar to readers. In this two-page spread, a handscroll maker is depicted on the right and a bookseller on the left.",
