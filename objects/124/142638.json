  "text": "The Zimbabwean artist Kudzanai Chiurai is known for his politically critical work, which landed him in exile in South Africa. His paintings are multi-layered collages that incorporate historical, artistic, and personal references—often difficult to fully grasp for an outsider. The sitter in this painting is unidentified. But the title (“October”), the depiction of a hammer and sickle, and the mention of land ownership all point to the October Revolution in Russia in 1917. Repossession of land was a big issue in the nascent Soviet state, as it was in post-independence Zimbabwe under the late President Mugabe.",
