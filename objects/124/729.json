  "text": "The Biblical parable of the prodigal son—a youth who wastes his wealth on riotous living before returning home poor and repentant—is depicted here with wine, women, and song. He shares a rich meal with two prostitutes as street musicians perform, his cloak and sword lying nearby to suggest he’ll soon continue his partying elsewhere. The clothed monkey eating an apple—an ancient symbol of love—and dragging a ball and chain indicate the son’s bondage to vice.\r\n\r\nFrame: Gift of the Marjorie Engels Memorial Fund and the Paintings Curatorial Council",
