  "text": "The form of scepter called <I>ruyi</I> (meaning as desired or as you wish) is an ancient auspicious symbol that became the mark of a cultivated gentleman. It may have originated as a weapon or as a Buddhist implement, but old paintings often depict scholars holding <I>ruyi</I> scepters while engaged in conversation. By the Ming period those done in organic taste like this one were common literati accoutrements and they were often given as gifts.\r\n<P>Carved from boxwood in imitation of rootwood, with <I>ruyi</I> heads, this scepter is a classic example of the Chinese scholar's love of natural forms. The reverse side bears a carved poem along the shaft which reads as follows:\r\n<P><I>Crows gather in the tree-lined alley, <P>bestowed by imperial order, seated for tea.\r\n<P>Returning to the Jade Hall feeling refreshed.\r\n<P>A new crescent moon shines over\r\n<P>branches of thorn ferns.</I>",
