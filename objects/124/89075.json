  "text": "By the mid-1960s Op Art was the dominant influence on design, with its dazzling optical experiences and emphasis on the illusion of movement. Although many Op Art textiles relied on dramatic juxtapositions of black and white geometric forms, others exploited the possibilities of contrasting color relationships. Circles, squares and chevrons, preferred motifs of this style, were manipulated to achieve a variety of effects, such as vibrating squares and complex figure-ground patterns.\r\n\r\n<I>Flower Arrows</I> draws on the linear aspects of Op Art; the floral element has been reduced to a supporting role and assertive wedge shapes provide a sense of dynamic motion. Part of a larger collection of psychedelic prints known as the <I>Ja-el</I> collection, <I>Flower Arrows</I> is printed on a stretchy nylon jersey that could be used as avant-garde upholstery or fashion fabric.",
