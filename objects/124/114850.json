  "text": "Katsumata Chieko forms her works by hand and then covers them with a thin cloth, through which she applies layers of color. Then she fires the form multiple times and applies more color, producing a soft but vividly colored object. Katsumata’s vessels and sculptures are often inspired by forms and textures found in nature.\r\n\tKatsumata trained as an industrial designer but devoted herself to pottery after a chance encounter with the American potter Fance Franck. After several years studying pottery in Paris, she returned to her native Japan, where she has become one of the most celebrated clay artists active today.",
