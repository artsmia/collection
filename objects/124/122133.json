  "text": "Red-crowned cranes were once ubiquitous throughout the wetlands of China, Korea, and Japan. Their impressive size (up to five feet tall), striking coloration, and lively “dance” made them a popular subject among artists. In East Asian mythology, they were believed to live for a thousand years, and thus became auspicious symbols of longevity. This set of screens would have been appropriate for especially felicitous events such as birthday and New Year’s celebrations.",
