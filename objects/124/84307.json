  "text": "With its vertical shaft marked by numerous perforations, this <I>tai-hu</I> type rock rests on a small base expanding slightly as it ascends. The off-white stone approximates the look of natural <I>tai-hu</I> limestone but it is most likely carved, at least in part, from another type of stone. With their love of double entendres, the literati of Ming and Ch'ing took occasional delight in displaying carved studio rocks that mirrored the color, shape, and formations of natural <I>tai-hu</I> stones.",
