  "text": "Photographer JoAnn Verburg has long collaborated with her husband, the poet Jim Moore–the “poet” identified in the title to this video assemblage–over the course of her career. In “The Poet and the Birds, ” Moore reclines comfortably beneath a canopy of trees, his face and body tilting away from the lens and toward the waterway beside him. Everything about his comportment speaks to his ease within this shimmering, liminal landscape–a space that is alive with the sounds of water, the rustling of leaves, birdsong. Moore’s figure is the still point at which earth, water, and sky meet, and a focal point for the viewer; his presence is at once elemental and eternal in its evocations, and a poignant invocation of a decades-long partnership in love and life.",
