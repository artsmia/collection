He slowly worked his way up in the art world and became a very popular, if somewhat old-fashioned, etcher in the 1920s. He dealt with a variety of subjects, but the quiet lives of ordinary people seems to have been his favorite field. An inscription, apparently added in pencil by the artist himself, reads: <i>Celui qui vient et celui qui n'en va</i> [He who comes and he who does not go]. This suggests a meditation on the cycle of life as represented by the extremes of youth and old age. The 1929 stock market crash ruined the market for Brouet's work, and he died in financial straits in 1941.</span>\n<font face=Times New Roman size=3>  </font>",
