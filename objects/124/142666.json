  "text": "Minnesota's Boundary Waters must have seemed familiar to many nordic immigrants. This scene of salmon fishermen at rest was made on the island of Nesøya in the fjord just a few miles from the center of Kristiania, now Norway's capital city, Oslo. Eilif Peterssen played a central role in combining the ideas and techniques of French Impressionism with traditional Scandinavian painting. Here we see an unmistakably northern view of low rocky terrain covered by pine forests painted with free, open brushwork of the Impressionists.",
