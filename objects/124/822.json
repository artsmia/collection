  "text": "This fantastic creature combines features from various animals, including a tiger-like head and water buffalo’s hooves. The sculpture catches the moment before the creature is about to leap, and the sculptural effect is achieved through the long sweeping curves of the body. The power of the shoulders is emphasized with a spiral pattern and a raised ring with turquoise inlay. The eyes are also inlaid with turquoise. While a number of contemporary bronze animals of similar scale and configuration have square sockets on their backs and probably served as supports for upright poles, this charming creature may have been cast as an independent stand-alone sculpture.",
