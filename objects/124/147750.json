This tradition, which continues in the region today, traces its roots to Spanish settler-artists who, in turn, learned from Pueblo artisans how to make pigments using native plants and minerals. Blending European religious iconography with Indigenous materials and techniques, their work reflects the enduring legacy of centuries-old folk art traditions. This synthesis is powerfully embodied in the image of this female saint. Although the saint cannot be definitively identified due to the absence of traditional attributes, the delicately rendered flesh tones and the richly detailed garment decoration make it a striking example of this regional artistic tradition.\n</p>\n</span>\n</p>",
