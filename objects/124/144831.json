  "text": "Born in Nara, Tomimoto Kenkichi first went to Tokyo to study design and in 1908 continued his studies in London. After returning to Japan in 1910, he became associated with Bernard Leach (1887–1979), who is considered the father of British studio pottery. Tomimoto began working in ceramics and emerged as a technical innovator, celebrated for his porcelain decoration. As a university professor, he influenced the next generation of artists and was designated a Living National Treasure in 1955.",
