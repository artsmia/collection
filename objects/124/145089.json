  "text": "Nathalie Krebs, a ceramic artist at the Danish company Bing & Grondahl, began the Saxbo pottery studio in 1930 in Herlev, Denmark, concentrating on stoneware glazes inspired by Chinese and Japanese pottery. Stæhr-Nielsen joined her in 1932, designing elegant forms while Krebs did the glazing. This spherical teapot is a showpiece for the striated glaze, and its rattan handle echoes Japanese mingei wares. This popular shape is now in limited production again by Spring Copenhagen.",
