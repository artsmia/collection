  "text": "During his time living in the French capital, André Kertész took many pictures of Parisian streets. When he left Paris in 1936, he left behind the glass-plate negative for this photograph with a friend. The friend kept this and other negatives throughout the Second World War, many of which were eventually returned to Kertész in 1963. He discarded many of the negatives, but kept this one. The reunification offered Kertész an opportunity to revisit his earlier work and consider this broken plate as a new composition.",
