  "text": "The mythical bird called the phoenix (<I>ch'u-niao</I>) evolved during the late Bronze Age and became a prominent art motif by the western Han dynasty (206 BCE- 9 CE). It was associated with the color red and represented the direction south. Eventually, the creature came to represent female royalty and, along with the dragon, symbolized the Chinese court.\r\n<BR>\r\n<P>How this charming bronze was used remains a mystery. A gilt bronze vessel made in the form of two cups joined by a phoenix like this one was discovered in 1968 in the 113 BCE tomb of Princess Tou Wan at Man-cheng, Hopei province. It is possible that this luxury object may have acted with others like it as supports for a metal or lacquer vessel placed in a royal burial.",
