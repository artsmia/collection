  "text": "White Ginger is one of several tropical flower prints Shirley Russell created in collaboration with Japanese publisher Watanabe Shōzaburō. The fragrant white ginger grew like a weed in Honolulu, Hawaii, where Russell lived for 60 years, supporting herself as a high school art teacher. According to Japanese printmaking tradition, a separate carver and printer executed this woodcut after Russell’s design.",
