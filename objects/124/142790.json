  "text": "This scene of happy workers harvesting grapes in the french countryside is among the most ambitious paintings of American-born Daniel Ridgway Knight. After studying in France as a young art student he returned there and became known professionally for his depictions of the working class in rural and village settings. This expansive painting shows off Knight's skill and his favored subjects: a lush landscape, hints of the specific locale, happy harvesters, and many skillfully observed details that bring the moment to life.",
