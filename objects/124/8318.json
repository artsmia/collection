  "text": "In one of his many forms, the Hindu god Shiva wanders through the forest disguised as an ascetic, wearing only a loincloth and holding a walking stick and rosary.  This small icon probably was destined for a family altar, and demonstrates that both Hindu and Buddhist deities were worshipped in Cambodia, though Shiva's crown indicates the artist's incorporation of Khmer Buddhist iconography.",
