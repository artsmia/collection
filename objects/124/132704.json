  "text": "Eyüboğlu came from a multifaceted artistic family of writers, musicians and artists. He had an international career yet remains underknown in the U.S. This painting shows his ability to abstract natural and hand-made forms, including cut glass vases and other decorative objects. The jittery, highly-worked textures come from his attention to surface detail that he observed in architecture and built structures.",
