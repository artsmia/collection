  "text": "This is one of 168 illustrations for Houdart de la Motte's Fables nouvelles (Paris, 1719), most of which were etched by Claude Gillot. This impression is not taken from the book, but was printed and sold separately. Houdart modeled his work on the fables of Jean de La Fontaine. Gillot's illustrations are considered the introduction of Rococo miniatures and vignettes to book illustration.",
