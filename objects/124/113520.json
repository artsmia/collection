  "text": "To create her flowing, hand-built sculptures, Fujikasa Satoko carefully manipulates thin coils of Shigaraki clay—a rough, sandy, yet pliable material used for centuries by Japanese potters in the Shiga region. The process can take many months. Her extremely thin-walled and dynamic forms push the boundaries of technique, resembling thin sheets of clay whipping in the wind or even the movement of air itself.",
