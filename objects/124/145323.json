  "text": "Simone Elizabeth Saunders’s “Break Away at Dawn” offers an altered retelling of the medieval theme of the “Hunt of the Unicorn.” Rather than hunting the unicorn, Saunders’s central figure frees the mythical being. In this key scene after the liberation, the triumphant Black woman rides the unicorn through a lush and colorful landscape, replete with tropical flowers. Saunders’s reinterpretation of this medieval theme and, specifically, its depiction in the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s tapestries, centralizes a vision of Black womanhood that is powerful and restorative.",
