The unusual use of color combined with a pattern of randomly scattered flowers, which were then unified by a subtle printed texture overlay. A popular pattern for twenty years, <I>Spice Garden</I> was printed on a number of different types of ground fabric, including lightweight linen, cotton, cotton and silk, and velvet.",
