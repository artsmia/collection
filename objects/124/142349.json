  "text": "[For Master Cobra Mansa]\r\nA man in sunglasses wears a blue and white costume and a red hat, colors repeated in the staged background and the frame with shelves around him. The combination of vibrant colors, playfulness, and visual rhythm is characteristic of the work of Moroccan photographer Hassan Hajjaj. The subject is the Brazilian master of capoeira, a martial art that originated with enslaved Africans in Brazil many centuries ago and combines elements of dance, acrobatics, and music. The pimentão red pepper tins in the frame refer to Master Cobra Mansa’s country of origin, while also invoking the repetitive motifs framing traditional Islamic mosaics.",
