  "text": "Similar to the Wieldon plate, this teapot is made of earthenware vividly decorated with colored glazes.  The pagoda, flowers, and furnishings on the faceted sides of the teapot, as well as the camel finial, were taken from Asian designs.  During the 18th century, Europeans and Americans alike were fascinated by products imported from the Far East and by accounts of travel to exotic places such as China, Japan, and India.  People surrounded themselves with <I>chinoiserie</I> prints, furniture, textiles, and ceramics influenced by Eastern designs.",
