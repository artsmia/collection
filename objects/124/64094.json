  "text": "In 1901 Buffalo, New York, hosted the Pan-American Exposition, featuring the cutting-edge technology of hydroelectric power, generated by Niagara Falls. The expo is now best remembered as the place where President William McKinley was fatally shot by a political dissident.\r\n\r\nThis quilt top is composed of squares that were sold at the expo for a penny apiece, with designs on them for quilters to embroider. Several depict the expo buildings. The Electric Tower, a monument to the “age of electricity, ” appears near the middle, just below the U.S. flag. President McKinley and his wife also are centrally placed. Such craft souvenirs were designed to entice female fairgoers.",
