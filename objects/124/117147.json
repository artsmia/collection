  "text": "For “Spring Tide” (Shunchō), Fujinuma used nemagaridake, dwarf bamboo that has narrow culms with a high degree of flexibility. The intricate twill technique and bundled elements of this basket give the rim and surrounding corpus a thick and sturdy appearance. For the interior surface where the vase rests, Fujinuma used a technique of irregular plaiting to create a dense base. It took Fujinuma three months to create this work and he has produced at least three like this in slightly different sizes.",
