  "text": "In this unusual depiction of Coney Island, New York artist Chaim Koppelman departed from his usual psychological and social artistic concerns to create a hauntingly expressionistic scene of a crowded summer beach. To produce the desired visual effects, he used a lift-ground etching technique that calls for the design to be applied with a sugary liquid before the copper plate is covered with varnish. When immersed in the acid bath the sugar expands and lifts off, leaving an exposed area of copper to be bitten by the acid. This is the area that is inked and printed.",
