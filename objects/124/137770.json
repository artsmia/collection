After studying and working in New York and California, he returned to the Twin Cities, where he worked at a plumbing supply company and taught studio art at various colleges. He used this sketchbook while living in New York. At the time, he was employed as a designer of stained glass, and he worked out some of his ideas in this book. Also within are quick studies he made of fellow passengers on public transportation, female nudes, and animals.",
