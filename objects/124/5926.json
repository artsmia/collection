  "text": "As part of the Nazi oppression of the Jews from the 1930s through the Second World War, Jews were forced to wear these badges in the shape of the Star of David, symbol of the Jewish religion, sewn to their clothing. On the star is the Dutch word Jood, or Jew, though the characters have been stylized to resemble Hebrew characters. Dutch Jews were required by Nazi decree in 1942 to wear the yellow star. Thousands were made in the Lotz ghetto in Poland to fulfill this directive. Now such an object would be part of a Holocaust Remembrance Day program, held at a different area synagogue each spring in the Twin Cities. In 2005, Holocaust Remembrance Day will be commemorated on May 6th.",
