  "text": "The Larsen Design Studio was particularly famous for their ability to create textiles with distinctive woven patterns. Although this design could have easily been printed on cotton fabric, as are all the other patterns in this exhibition, a woven form was utilized to incorporate a bas relief element. The sculptural character is further emphasized by the satin weave structure and pressed surface that enhances the reflective quality of the cloth.",
