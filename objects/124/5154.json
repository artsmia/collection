  "text": "Japanese monks who traveled to China returned with many foreign treasures, including temmoku tea bowls. Named after Mount Tianmu (Temmoku in Japanese) in Zhejiang Province where many Japanese monks received Zen training, these bowls were distinguished by their conical shape, small foot, and lustrous black glaze. Highly prized as rare imported objects, temmoku tea bowls were always used in conjunction with a lacquered stand.",
