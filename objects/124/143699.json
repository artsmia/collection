  "text": "This bib (mune-ate) for a gunner or firefighter is made of red wool and decorated in the center with a crest of ascending wisteria (agari fuji). Above it are two sea monsters called shachihoko that have a jewel (tama) between them. Shachihoko were used to decorate the main keep of a castle, the most famous being the golden shachihoko at Nagoya. The crest could refer to the Andō family, feudal lords of Tanabe domain in Kii province (today Tanabe city in Wakayama Prefecture). The bib was worn over the armor but under either a jinbaori (in the case of a gunner) or a haori (in the case of a samurai firefighter) coat. Because of its self-extinguishing properties, wool helps to protect the wearer from stray sparks and therefore was a good choice for firefighters' clothing.",
