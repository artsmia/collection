  "text": "The word “settle” refers to a type of long wooden bench with arms and a high, sometimes curved backrest. The form, which originated in medieval times, was resurrected in the 19th century by William Morris and his circle, who looked to the past and to handcrafted objects for their pure and dignified power. This example is a showcase for the painting in gold gesso by Kate Faulkner, sister of one of the founding members of Morris’s design business, and a designer in her own right.",
