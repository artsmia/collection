  "text": "This sketchbook is crammed with hundreds of studies of Italian landscapes, classicizing figures, and antique sculpture. The landscapes and works of art sketched on the pages locate the artist in the vicinity of Rome and Naples, where Francesco di Bartolomeo Guerrini, a Sienese artist, was active in the years coinciding with the few dates written in the book. The frenzied sketches, careful studies, and uninhibited scribbles offer a tantalizing glimpse into the artist’s private thoughts and inspirations.",
