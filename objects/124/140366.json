But they sure do! That’s how they do it: slowly, methodically, with a smile on their faces. The Regime is suffocating it a little bit more each day. I simply can not think of any other justification for the multiple ways in which the operation of USPS is being destroyed. It is being done solely to further corrupt the election process.</i>",
