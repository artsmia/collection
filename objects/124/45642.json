  "text": "Typically a tea master will sprinkle incense directly on the coals in the hearth, rather than using an incense burner. However, on rare occasions when he wants to draw attention to the Buddhist theme of a scroll hanging in the tokonoma (alcove)--or when a tea gathering itself is held as a memorial event--he may display the burner as well. Japanese have always been great admirers of Chinese ceramics and, for such an occasion, tea masters prefer the formality and soft luminescence of Song dynasty Longquan celadon, such as this rare example.",
