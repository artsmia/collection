  "text": "The deity Akiba Gongen is worshipped as a protector against fire. He is commonly portrayed as a figure with elements of the Shinto beings called tengu, the Buddhist Wisdom King Fudō Myōō, and the Hindu goddess Dakini. Tengu are fierce, winged goblins with sharp beaks and a human body. Like the Buddhist Wisdom King Fudō Myōō, Akiba Gongen is dressed as a Buddhist monk and holds a double-edged sword and a rope. Like Dakini, he rides on a white fox and flies through the sky.",
