  "text": "Kaasa blankets made of sheep’s wool are valued possessions of the pastoral Fulani people, many of whom make their livelihoods tending cattle, moving with their herds from one grazing area to another. This blanket is made of woven strips sewn together; the artist took care to align the motifs across the bands so that more complex designs appear. Many of these geometric patterns have specific names, and most of them relate to cattle herding, human habitation, and female fertility.",
