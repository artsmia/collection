  "text": "The Frankfurt Kitchen introduced concepts that still appeal to us today. It is efficient, space-saving, and easy to clean. Prep while sitting on a stool, dry your dishes in the rack above the sink. Baking and cooking staples are kept handy in labeled aluminum bins. Unlike old-style kitchens with dirty, wood-burning stoves, this kitchen has a modern electric stove, a large window for natural light, a movable ceiling light fixture, a pass-through to the dining room, and even a mounted ironing board (for freshly pressed napkins?).\r\n\r\nSchütte-Lihotzky studied train dining cars and ship galleys as well as the work of kitchen reformers when designing the Frankfurt Kitchens. Mass-produced, they were installed in 10, 000 new apartments built to ease Germany’s housing shortage after World War I.",
