  "text": "Chinese potters wedged together different colors of clay to create ceramics with interesting color variations. Known as <I>neriage</I> or <I>nerikomi</I> in Japanese, this technique has been revived by Japanese contemporary potters. Self-taught potter Ogata Kamiō lives in Shinshinotsu Village on Japan's northernmost island, Hokkaidō. His contribution to the <I>neriage</I> technique is to combine shades of clay in such a way as to create the visual perception of movement.",
