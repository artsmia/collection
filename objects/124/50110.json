  "text": "The strains of Death's bony violin have lulled the revelers at a masked ball into a permanent sleep, but the other musicians scramble for the exit. The image is an allegory of a cholera epidemic that struck Paris in 1831. The outbreak killed 20, 000 of the city's 650, 000 inhabitants. After several years as a highly successful painter of major public commissions, Alfred Rethel's intermittent bouts of mental illness led him to devote himself to the less-pressured activity of printmaking. In his new field he closely studied the work of his German forebears, including Hans Holbein, whose miniature studies of Death appear in this gallery.",
