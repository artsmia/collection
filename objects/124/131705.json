  "text": "Essentially a circle of cloth with a slit opening and hole for the neck, a bōzugappa has a deceptively simple appearance. The cape’s multilayered construction includes an inner layer of waterproofed paper, resulting in a water- and wind-resistant garment. Its maker’s skill and eye for design is also evident in the clever piecing of the cloth. Made from triangular-shaped sections of striped cloth, the wedges converge at diagonals, creating a bold chevron pattern that directs the eye to the wearer’s face. The maker who cut and sewed this garment undoubtedly had this effect in mind.",
