  "text": "Like so many of Castle’s constructions, this imaginative interpretation of an exterior wall and double-hung window demonstrates the artist’s skill and ingenuity in transforming ordinary found materials into expressive woarks of art. Though this construction is ostensibly representational, Castle emphasizes its abstract linear and geometric characteristics, while at the same time drawing attention to its textural and material qualities by means of folding, wrapping, and binding. This interweaving of the work’s conceptual content and physical properties is highly characteristic of Castle’s art as a whole.",
