  "text": "The term verdure—which means “greenery” in both French and English—is used for tapestries covered with a design of large leaves, often with flowers and, in higher-quality examples, birds and animals. Such all-over patterning was easily adapted to tapestries of any size. It did not require the precise delineation and complex shading needed for human figures, so weaving could progress relatively rapidly. As a result, verdures were available to a wide range of buyers, including small landowners and merchants as well as nobles and royalty.",
