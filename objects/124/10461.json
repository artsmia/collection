  "text": "Sir Henry Singleton was a British painter, highly regarded as a miniaturist and portraitist. Henry’s style was influenced by his uncle, William Singleton, a miniature and portrait painter as well, who raised him after his father passed away. By age sixteen Henry Singleton was a professional portrait painter and exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1784 through 1839.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of Singleton’s works were mythological, biblical, or Shakespearean themed, but many were historical or representative of contemporary events.The Marriage of the Duke and Duchess of York portrays his skill as a portrait painter and potential as a history painter, though he was never respected as one.",
