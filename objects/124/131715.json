  "text": "Material and technique: Felted wool and tie-dye (shibori)\r\nMost wool felt was made in China or Mongolia and then exported to Japan. This felt rug (mōsen) features large and small roundels in white, augmented with red dye. It is unknown whether the shibori (tie-dye) dye work was done before it reached Japan, but its fineness and saturation suggest a Japanese sensibility. Because of its relatively small size, it was likely used as a mat (chagujoku) for ritualistic serving of sencha, a loose-leaf green tea.",
