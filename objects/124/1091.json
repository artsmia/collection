  "text": "The profile of this <I>jia</I> wine vessel’s body is S-shaped, with the inward curvature placed close to the rim of the vessel. Dragonized <I>taotie</I> and rising blades with stylized cicadas decorate the neck belt. The body <I>taotie</I>, on a ground of squared spirals, displays unusual features: horns with alternating T-shaped and straight scores usually associated with flanges, and a hybrid forehead shield with the upper part hooked and the lower half drawn as the round-topped shield. Notable, too, is the small vertical dragon beneath the tail of the cleft <I>taotie</I> under the handle. The handle is topped with a bovine head and terminates with curved legs ending in hooves. Underneath, in place of an inscription, is a bearded human figure in flat relief on a spiral ground. The pictogram represents a clan’s insignia and is seen in many bronze vessels of the late Shang dynasty.",
