  "text": "This fan painting by Wei Zhihuang depicts a tranquil riverside, with clusters of trees and reeds framing a small boat. Within it sits a solitary recluse, a popular motif in Chinese landscape painting. Reclusion symbolized the scholar’s withdrawal from worldly affairs in pursuit of purity, self-reflection, and harmony with nature. Here, the quiet presence of the lone figure amid expansive waters conveys a vision of peace and detachment. Wei’s scene turns the fan into a poetic meditation on solitude, renewal, and the timeless search for spiritual freedom.",
