  "text": "This monumental head depicts Brahma, the Hindu creator god and member of the Trimurti with Vishnu and Shiva. His four faces symbolize all-knowing perception and the recitation of the four Vedas. The serene features, almond-shaped eyes, and elaborate looped coiffures reflect the enduring influence of Gupta sculpture while anticipating the greater monumentality of early medieval temple art. As depictions of Brahma are relatively rare, this work offers insight into shifting devotional practices and the visual language of Hindu cosmology, enriching understanding of South Asia’s sacred artistic traditions.",
