  "text": "Walking down a muddy track, shouldering his gun and accompanied by his dog, an outdoorsman would be in his element. Fournier’s landscape captures the sensory experience of seasonal change as summer turns to fall. Browning plants in the foreground, hints of color in the trees’ foliage, and a mild blue sky with puffs of cloud, all bespeak a fine September day. Fournier’s site for this painting may have been near the Louisville Swamp, in the Minnesota River valley south of Carver, Minnesota.",
