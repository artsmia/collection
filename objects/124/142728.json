  "text": "Closely identified with the second generation of Abstract Expressionists, Helen Frankenthaler invariably used the basic visual elements of color and pictorial space as a means to achieve an emotional resonance in her non-objective compositions. Her innovative technique of pouring diluted paint directly on unprimed canvas—known as stain painting—was her signature style. This act of pouring became a literal metaphor for larger concepts like nature and open landscapes. Using line, color, and texture, Frankenthaler’s aim was always to make aesthetically compelling works that evoked deeper emotions. Beginnings, 2002, is a prime example of her style and techniques being applied across an array of media over her lifetime. The thin layering of oranges, lilac, and blue hues speak to her mastery of screenprinting.",
