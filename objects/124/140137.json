  "text": "Kamoda often contrasted bold surface decoration with dabs or dots of glaze. The impression of this simple plate is greatly enhanced by this approach. He also imbued the form with a surprising weightlessness by sharply carving the foot so that, seen in profile, it seems to float above the surface of the table.",
