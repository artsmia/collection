  "text": "This bamboo wristrest is extensively engraved in its dark material with several poetic inscriptions in flowing <I>hsing-shu</I> script signed on more than one occasion with Ch'u Ying-shao's art name, Tzu-yeh. Ch'u Tzu-yeh was an early nineteenth-century painter, calligrapher, I-hsing teapot designer and engraver from Shanghai. He would almost have certainly engraved this wristrest himself rather than merely writing out a text for a bamboo carver to execute.",
