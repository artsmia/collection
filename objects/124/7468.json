  "text": "Woodcuts had a far richer tradition among Germans than among Italians, making Master I.B. with the Bird-note the tiny bird next to his monogram-a rarity. Of his eleven woodcuts, Saint Jerome and the Lion is the finest. The image of the ascetic saint removing a thorn from a lion's paw, which represents compassion subduing brute strength, was a bit outdated when the master created his intricate woodcut. More in vogue was Albrecht Dürer's scholarly portrayal of the saint, also included in this exhibition. Both prints include Saint Jerome's traditional iconography of skull, signifying life's transience; book, showing his scholarly nature; and cardinal's hat and crucifix, showing his devotion.",
