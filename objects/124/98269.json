  "text": "After emigrating from Germany in 1848, Roesen made his reputation in central Pennsylvania, where he specialized in large-scale floral still life paintings. His lush portrayals of flowers struck a chord within the region, which was experiencing an economic boom thanks to a thriving timber industry. Roesen’s paintings were originally displayed in homes, restaurants, and taverns throughout the area, where they symbolized the seemingly limitless abundance of America’s natural resources.",
