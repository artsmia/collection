  "text": "Color field painter Gene Davis began to employ vertical stripes of color in 1958 and continued throughout his career. He produced composition in all scales from his 43,680 square-foot Niagara (said to be the world’s largest painting) to his 3/4 square-inch “micro-paintings.” Prints such as this used a canvas support, thereby creating an affordable, domestically-scaled version of Davis’s work.",
