  "text": "The Italian Baroque painter Pier Francesco Mola was known for his mystical devotional paintings representing solitary saints praying in lush, idyllic landscapes. Here Mola depicts Saint Francis praying on Mount Alverna, where a powerful vision left the saint with the wounds of Christ's Crucifixion permanently marking his hands, feet, and chest. Mola represents the presence of the divine as a burst of light breaking through the cloudy sky. Mola executed a related painting on marble representing Saint Francis Receiving the Stigmata, which is also in Mia's collection (2020.13.1).",
