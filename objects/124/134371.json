  "text": "Original Plumbing is a trans male print quarterly that explores topics relevant to transmasculinity and nonbinary identity through portraiture, pictorials, interviews, advice articles, and essays. With content ranging from cheeky, candid photography to deeply personal accounts of transition and identity, Original Plumbing aims to capture and celebrate “a true diversity in the FTM (female to male) community; in size, age, body, surgery, hormone use and non-hormone use.” As an independently published zine that began in 2009, Original Plumbing was a space for trans men and their stories when such a space did not exist in the media.",
