The story begins at the wedding of the hero Peleus and the sea-nymph Thetis. The goddess of discord, Eris, was the only deity not invited to the grand celebration. In a fit of anger, she threw a golden apple inscribed with the words &quot;To the Fairest&quot; into the gathering. Three powerful goddesses immediately claimed the apple: Juno, queen of the gods; Minerva, goddess of wisdom and war; and Venus, the goddess of love and beauty. Unwilling to incur the wrath of the two losers, Zeus deputized the mortal Paris, a young prince of Troy who was living as a shepherd, to serve as the judge. The goddesses appeared before Paris and, to influence his decision, each offered a bribe. Juno promised to make him the ruler of all Europe and Asia. Minerva offered to grant him unparalleled wisdom and skill in battle. Venus promised him the love of the most beautiful of all mortal women, Helen, who was inconveniently already married to King Menelaus of Sparta. Opting for love rather than power or glory, Paris chose Venus and awarded her the golden apple. As promised, Venus helped Paris abduct Helen and take her to Troy, which led Menelaus and the Greeks to launch a massive expedition to reclaim her, thus beginning the decade-long Trojan War. Juno and Minerva, enraged by Paris's insult, became bitter enemies of the Trojans and supported the Greeks throughout the conflict.</span>",
