  "text": "This dish is finely incised with a pair of writhing, five-clawed dragons in pursuit of a flaming Chintamani jewel amid scrolling flames. The exterior of the gently rounded sides is similarly decorated with two striding dragons, covered with a translucent glaze of lemon-yellow color. Yellow was seen as the generator of <i>yin</i> and <i>yang</i> forces, and therefore represented the center of everything in existence. Because of its value and prestige, yellow was reserved exclusively for use by the imperial household. Together with the five-clawed dragon motif, this bowl encompasses the visual language associated with royal power.",
