  "text": "George Bellows heeded the admonition of his teacher Robert Henri (1865-1929) to draw your material from the life around you. Bellows' range of subjects made him instantly popular: New York scenes, revivalist meetings, political satire, prizefights. Compared to the intimate, anecdotal prints of John Sloan, Bellows preferred compositional vigor and simplified gesture. The look of River Front, set in New York's East River, owes more to the geometric theories Bellows had been studying than to the interactions of the bathers.",
