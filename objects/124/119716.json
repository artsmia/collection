  "text": "The lady of a prosperous household has been entertaining her lover- at upper left is a porcelain cup decorated with tako karakusa (octopus vine pattern), and a tobacco set. She lays back and flings her arms over her head pulling at her hair and bracing herself. Her lover comments: It feels like an octopus' suckers sticking to my palm. This is truly a high quality vagina. She answers: I feel good, like I've eaten many treats at once. I lack the words to describe it. I'm satisfied time and again, like my forty-four bones are melting.",
