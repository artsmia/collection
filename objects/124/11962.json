  "text": "Chimu ceramics were made in molds, with unique decorative details added when the halves were joined.  The placement of a hand-modeled bird where the spout meets the arch is a distinctive marker of the Chimu style.  Given the probable date of manufacture, this piece was likely made by a Chimu artist for an Incan patron.  The body of the vessel depicts a fruit or vegetable.  Food was depicted frequently in art from this region, as it connoted feasting and abundance.",
