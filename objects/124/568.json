  "text": "This large, ornate vase is shaped to vaguely imitate an ancient bronze wine vessel. Eight ears project from the neck and shoulder of the vase: four at the neck are carved in the form of a bird, while those at the shoulder are in the form of an animal mask with loose pendant rings. The main area of decoration is carved with animal masks like those commonly found on ancient bronze vessels. Its tall lid is adorned with a band of phoenix designs and a stylized lotus-flower finial. \r\n<P>The vessel, carved in an imperial workshop, reflects the interest in archaic Chinese culture that flourished during the Emperor Qianlong’s reign (1736–95). When translated into jade, however, the powerful archaic motifs that once echoed ancient rites lost their original meanings and symbolic value, ultimately serving only as ornamental elements.",
