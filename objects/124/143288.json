  "text": "If you could make a device that would harness the power of the spirit realm to transform the hearts of human beings into emanations of pure love, what might that look like? What would it need to do? How would it work. These are some of the ideas that artist Renee Stout played with in making this piece. It is an absurd imaginary machine that works in conjunction with otherworldly forces in order to remove bad thoughts and intentions from people. But it might also connect on a wavelength that allows the artist to communicate with spirits, or even extraterrestrial beings.",
