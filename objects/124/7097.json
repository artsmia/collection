  "text": "Josef Hoffmann, a founder of the Wiener Werkstätte (Vienna Workshops) in 1903, developed designs for various household objects made of <I>gitterwerk</I>, or gridwork, such as the basket and storm lantern in this case. The gridded sheets of base metal were thus the structure of the objects as well as their decoration. Affordably made, they were often nickel- or silver-plated for added attractiveness. The pervasiveness of simplicity and geometry in Hoffmann's designs during this period can be seen in his <I>Wasserfall</I> textile, as well as his designs for furniture.",
