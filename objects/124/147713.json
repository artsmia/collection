  "text": "Standing over six feet tall and extending over one foot to the right and left, Majestoso ancestral da árvore is at once a commanding and playful figure. Made of palm fronds bound in colorfully painted leather and adorned with cowrie shells, this totemic sculpture entices the viewer with its tassels and delicate patterning while maintaining an impressive presence. Created by Deoscóredes Maximiliano dos Santos, better known as Mestre Didi–a renowned artist, author, and spiritual leader–the sculpture powerfully channels Didi’s faith traditions in its evocation of the ancestral figures central to his faith, Candomblé, a West African diasporic religion developed in Brazil.",
