  "text": "In this painting Purkhu translates the poetic couplets written on the back into visual form. He focuses on a sensitive and dramatic moment: Shiva (indicated by the crescent moon on his forehead) is so enamored at the sight of Parvati beneath the tree that he doesn’t realize the snake wrapped around his wrist has slipped from his hands into the water intended for the evening’s rite, a Hindu ritual bath (sandhaya). The drama unfoldsunder the marvelous glow of the setting sun, while Parvati’s attendants giggle at the scene.",
