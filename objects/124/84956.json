  "text": "The Braniff Airline project gave Larsen the opportunity to design a broad range of textiles that would, in essence, define the airline’s visual identity. Using the constraints of standardized equipment, he created distinctive environments, from lounges to airplane interiors, for a broad range of passengers.<P> \r\nThe first order consisted of over 1500 yards of custom yarn-dyed, wool drapery intended for airport lounge areas. This fabric, related in structure, fiber content and weight to the company’s <I>Tunis</I>, had a somewhat irregular two-color striped pattern which was woven in eight color ways ranging from orange/red to green/gold. In addition to this, almost 400 yards of <I>Interplay</I>, an innovative Larsen casement fabric, were needed for large window areas. Later, other fabrics, such as a mohair plush upholstery, were developed for the areas used by first class passengers, including plane interiors and cabin dividers.",
