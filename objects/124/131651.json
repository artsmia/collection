  "text": "Technique: Nanbu split weave (Nanbu saki-ori)\r\nThis blanket is an extraordinary example of what we now call “upcycling.” The textile maker cut worn cloth into narrow strips and then wove them as the weft, with cotton or hemp threads as the warp. Because the textile that results is very dense, it is ideal for imparting warmth in winter. Peasants in what is today Aomori Prefecture in northern Japan were encouraged by the local Nanbu clan rulers to recycle their worn or damaged cotton garments; thus, this technique is known as Nanbu saki-ori (“Nanbu split-weaving”). Blankets like this one were used as bedding covers or as a cover for a kotatsu, a charcoal brazier placed in the middle of a room as a heating source.",
