  "text": "This <I>gui</I> demonstrates the inventiveness with which Western Zhou artisans adapted Shang forms. The main body is a standard <I>gui</I> with a deep bowl, while the looped handles on either side of the body are innovatively rendered in the form of an elephant’s head and trunk. Furthermore, the vessel is elevated by a high, square base. On the main body, the flanges form the centerlines of the familiar bodied <I>taotie</I>. On the base it is the same motif except for the central line, here a slight ridge instead of a flange. The handles, which combine a crested elephant head with a bird’s body, are the most remarkable feature of the vessel. The bow displays the wings of a bird in relief, and the projection at the bottom contains the bird’s curled tail and its feet descending almost to rest on the tail. The elephant head has large C-shaped ears, raised trunk, and protruding tusks.",
