  "text": "This mosaic of a large saltwater crab comes from the excavations of the ancient Italian city of Pompeii, also the origin of the nearby fresco fragment of a standing deity. Since the crab is the traditional symbol of Cancer, the fourth sign of the zodiac, this panel was probably one of twelve designs set into the same marble pavement to illustrate the months of the year.",
