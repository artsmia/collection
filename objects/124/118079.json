  "text": "In tea gatherings, burning incense is often a preparatory act, meant to create a welcoming mood as the guests enter the tea room. As such, the incense box (kōgō) may be shown in the display alcove (tokonoma), or left in the waiting area (sotomachiai) for the contemplation of the guests. The sweetfish design on this incense box is executed in <i>takamaki-e</i>, and the sheen of its scales is achieved with gradients of sprinkled gold powder. The rough surface of the river stones is rendered in silver and gold kirigane, while bubbles of mother-of-pearl inlay subtly enhance the movement.",
