  "text": "Though perhaps better known as a sculptor, Kiki Smith regularly works in drawing, installation art, and printmaking, a medium she considers of key importance to her creative practice. In this mixed intaglio print, Smith presents an anonymous woman (Josephine) in profound grief, shedding an oversize red teardrop that she cradles in her hands. Intended as metaphor, Smith's portrayal of grief is one of universal relevance, perhaps even more so today than in 1999 when she originally produced this print.",
