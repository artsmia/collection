  "text": "The photographer Paul Shambroom has long been fascinated by power dynamics, especially those played out in controlled spaces. For his series Factories, he spent several years visiting mechanized work environments. This image was taken at the Graco factory in Minneapolis, which manufactures industrial products. The hanging blue shapes provide a rhythmic pattern, evocative of the repetitive nature of factory work. The products made here would have been the result of several layers of care, including that of the lone figure who sprays these parts with paint.",
