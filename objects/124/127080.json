  "text": "Ursula Schulz-Dornburg, known for her typological study of vernacular architecture, documented bus stops in rural Romania from 1997 to 2011. In a manner distinguished from photographers trained in Dusseldorf Academy's Photography Department (where the Bechers taught), SchulzDornburg, who was originally trained in photojournalism, has made functional and everyday architecture and dwellings the subject of her black and white concept-base documentary photography. She often set the horizon in the middle of the photographs, and occasionally included passengers waiting for a bus. She relates her photographs of these structures to Ed Ruscha's earlier photographs of the vernacular architecture from Southern California.",
