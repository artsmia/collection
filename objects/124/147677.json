  "text": "In the 1760s, a cool wind blew through the frivolous and fussily ornamental world of French porcelain manufacture. Etienne-Maurice Falconet became director of the sculpture workshops of the Sèvres manufactory, designing in the &quot;Greek taste&quot; that channeled antiquity at its most monumental. In this case, a rectilinear Greek meander snakes around a vase formed from a fluted column base. The ground is glazed with an imitation of lapis lazuli.",
