  "text": "Richard Haas gained fame in the 1970s for his enormous outdoor murals that transformed blank, drab building facades into grand architectural fantasies. In the early to mid-1960s, ha was a graduate student and instructor at the University of Minnesota. He has periodically returned to make watercolor studies of the architecture of Minneapolis. He used one such drawing, which the artist has also given to Mia, as the basis for this print. Here the viewpoint seems to be near the Capella Building looking toward the Wells Fargo Center.",
