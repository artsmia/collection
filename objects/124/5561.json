  "text": "A grogger is a noise maker used during the traditional reading of the Megillah (scroll) Esther during the festival of Purim.  During the reading of the story, listeners use the grogger to drown out each mention of the name of Haman, the villian of the story. While this grogger is the usual traditional form, the material is ivory and probably from India or Africa.",
