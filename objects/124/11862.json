  "text": "This large square jade seal is carved with the characters <I>dao de can bao</I> meaning treasure of the library of Daoist classics. The seal appears to have been designed for official use in a library applied to Daoist texts that had been part of a burgeoning canonical literature during Yuan and Ming times. The large size and particular form of this seal relate it to a long line of official seals beginning in the Han dynasty (206 BCE - 220 CE). By Sung (960-1279), the large seals were important symbols of official authority and were used to insure the authenticity of important documents, calligraphy, and paintings. The character <I>shan</I> (mountain) on top of the handle equates the seal with the cosmic pillar forming a link between heaven and the text it imprints.",
