  "text": "Kaneshige Tōyō is generally considered to be the founder and seminal artist of contemporary traditional Bizen pottery. With the modernization of Japan in the late 19th century, Bizen pottery almost disappeared until innovators like Kaneshige revived it in the 1930s by exploring and experimenting with kiln building. In 1956, Kaneshige became the first Bizen potter designated a Living National Treasure by the Japanese government. (There are now five.) He made this cylindrical vase, with uneven loop handles on either side, one year before the designation.",
