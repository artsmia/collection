These visual elements suggest that she is Ise no Tayū, a famous poet who is one of the late classical Thirty-Six Immortal Poets.\r\n\r\nMiyagawa Chōshun was an ukiyo-e artist who specialized in painting rather than woodblock prints. Chōshun was renowned for his delicate style and ability to depict figures that seem to interact in a natural and convincing manner.",
