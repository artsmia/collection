  "text": "This elegant iron comes from Gabon, where the Kwele peoples used it as currency, especially to compensate the bride’s family in marriage transactions. Interestingly, the two oval appendages could be taken off as single pieces and spent as a fraction of the entire object. \r\nThe design of this currency appears to be inspired by the European ship’s anchor. Beginning in the late 1400s, first the Portuguese, then the Dutch, French, Spanish, and English landed on Gabon’s shores to buy ivory, hardwoods, and, increasingly, enslaved people. With their seemingly endless supplies of cloth, firearms, and alcoholic beverages, these ships were perceived as imbued with power, wealth, and prestige. One can imagine that anchors carried special associations that made them fit to be adapted to local currency.",
