  "text": "This print by the pioneering landscapist Augustin Hirschvogel does triple duty: it depicts a picturesque seaside village, a parade of sailing vessels, and an Old Testament story. The biblical reference is the lone frolicking whale, perhaps inserted to explain the calm waters; when Jonah went overboard, the tempest subsided. In keeping with his early career as a mapmaker, Hirschvogel pinpointed the spot with the label Jonah.",
