  "text": "What has Thomas Sills depicted in this colorful painting of overlapping forms? Are these sea creatures, glowing with bioluminescence? Are they microscopic creatures splitting and multiplying? Is this the image of a neblua out far past our solarsystem? The answer could be any or all. Sills was captivated by nature and was inventive in his handling of paint and color gradations. Without depicting any particular or specific phenomenon in nature, he made analagous evocative images in paint that tickle the imagination of the viewer.",
