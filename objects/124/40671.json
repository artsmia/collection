  "text": "Lobed and scalloped lacquer forms that evolved during the Yuan dynasty (1280-1368) remained popular throughout the Ming (1368-1644). In the center of this red lacquer eight-lobed square form dish are three scholars playing a board game known as Go, a pastime popular with the learned class and became a symbol in itself of this elite group and its values. Emanating outward are an eight-lobed design carved with sprigs of <I>lingzhi</I> fungus on a star-patterned background as well as an outer band of flowering plants.",
