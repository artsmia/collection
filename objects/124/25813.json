  "text": "Although many dishes of this type were produced for export to the West, similar dishes have been found in China and other parts of Asia. This dish is believed to have been exported to India, its large size reflective of the communal eating practices in the region, where diners would gather around a single large dish. Plates in this style are often termed <I>Kraak</I>, after the Portuguese trading ships called carracks that brought these items from Asia to Europe.",
