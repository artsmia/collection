  "text": "During the Ming dynasty (1368-1644), ivory <I>hu</I> were used by court officials from the first to fifth rank. These plain tablets were carried by officials while actually in the imperial presence. They denoted the category of the official concerned and were kept by the court doorkeeper as their possession gave access to restricted areas. They were no longer used at court during Ch'ing (1644-1912).",
