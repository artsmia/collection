  "text": "Alfonse Legros leaves much to the imagination. Our resting traveler carries little more than a walking stick; so, it seems he’s just out for the day. What is his destination—the house near the horizon? To Legros, the life of the tree may be more interesting than that of the man. The trunk twists and grows, shooting out branches and leaves. It’s life force overwhelms the quiet scene.",
