  "text": "This three-legged incense burner is carved from white jade, a highly valued stone that peaked in popularity during the 18th and 19th centuries. The tripod form and the rings held by the dragon heads reference ancient Chinese ritual bronze vessels. The alluring mystery of the ancient past, combined with the otherworldly dragon, imbues the censer with both power and mystique. \r\n\r\nThis censer was made for imperial use, as shown by the four-character reign mark on the bottom, <i>Qianlong yuzhi</i> (imperial made during the Qianlong reign). This is reinforced by the presence of two lions carved in openwork on the lid. Like dragons, lions were seen as guardian figures. Their presence in Chinese art originated in Buddhist traditions but later became associated with imperial power as well.",
