  "text": "Ann Morgan designed this playfully surreal illustration for the 1985 Secrets issue of the longrunning underground zine Artpolice. The scene features two anonymous doll-like figures in elaborately patterned outfits meeting face to face in a darkened cave. Each directs a flashlight  beam to the other's face, illuminating the cave and its numerous stalactites and stalacmites. Interpretation is left largely to the viewer.",
