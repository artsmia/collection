  "text": "This type of carpet is a rarely seen example of Tibetan Buddhist art. Often depicting either flayed animal or human skins, it was reserved for the highest order of initiated monks and served as a sacred seat of power for the practitioner. While the imagery is gruesome—many have elaborate borders with severed heads—the woven compositions aid a form of meditational practice in which one visualizes detachment from one’s body on the path to a release from human suffering.",
