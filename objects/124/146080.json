  "text": "Black conceals, but it cannot eliminate all color. In these two examples, Hamaguchi carefully controls the layers of color to excavate the ball of yarn hidden underneath the darkness. While the ball is faintly visible in the darker version, the various colors—of which blue is the most prominent—forms a glow around the ball and seems to push it forward into the viewer’s hands.",
