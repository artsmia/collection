  "text": "In ancient Egypt, representing gods in animal form allowed followers to worship a physical being instead of an abstract concept. Sacred animal sculptures acted as extensions of the gods. They were revered, featured in ceremonies, and even mummified and buried with the dead as offerings to the god they represented. Some examples are on view here: the god Thoth depicted as an ibis or baboon, the goddess Sekhmet as a lioness, and the god Osiris represented by the Apis bull.",
