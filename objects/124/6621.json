Its asymmetrical body indicates it was meant to be placed on its side—it was probably intended for storing sake (rice wine). Natural ash glaze, pooled on its surface, creates a pleasing mottled effect on its shoulders and a pattern of drips along a portion of the jar’s irregular, bulging body.\n</p>\n<font face=Times New Roman size=3>  </font>",
