  "text": "Pieced stars were popular in the United States from the 1840s to 1875, perhaps owing to the influence of kaleidoscopes. First manufactured in 1816, kaleidoscopes were perfected in the following decades.\r\n\r\nFor this quilt, scores of red, white, and blue diamond-shaped fabric pieces were painstakingly stitched together. The alternating bands of color create a pulsating effect, like a glowing sun. Signs of heavy washing tell us this quilt functioned as a bedcover. Though delicately constructed, it was still expected to withstand the rigors of daily use.",
