She is trying to appease him, apparently her last customer of the evening who has been kept waiting. He complains: You made me wait quite a while, haven't you? I'm not letting you go anywhere after this. She assures him of his importance: I wouldn't exchange you for the moon or the flowers. Because of you, I don't hate even my most arduous duties. Please be sure to never abandon me.",
