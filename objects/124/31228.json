  "text": "These twelve recumbent animals each represent one of the twelve earthly branches of the Chinese calendar. They include, in numerical order, the rat, ox, tiger, hare, dragon, snake, horse, ram, monkey, cock, dog, and pig. These symbolic animals are employed for chronological purposes and are used to designate the hours, days, months, and years. Each animal is supposed to exercise some influence over the period of time denoted by the special characteristics of that animal. Many Chinese people also believe that a person's physical attributes, personality, success, and happiness are all influenced by the zodiac animal under which they were born.\r\n<P>The first explicit mention of zodiac animals is found in Tang (618-906) texts, and ceramic zodiac figures have survived from that time. It probably wasn't until the Yuan dynasty (the era of Mongol rule) however, that the usage became popular and widespread.",
