  "text": "Ann Morgan produced this delightfully playful illustration as the cover design for the Valentine's Day issue of the longrunning Artpolice zine series. Published in February 1982, the illustration was reproduced in bright red, emphasizing the traditional color associated with the romantic holiday. Here, a lone young woman wearing heart-patterned attire enjoys a sweet treat. Floating potato mashers and a border garland of leaves serve as counterpoints to the figure. Morgan's pared-down illustration reads as humourous and innocent despite its decidedly surreal atmosphere.",
