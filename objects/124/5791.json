  "text": "Chen Chun, one of the most important Ming dynasty calligraphers and flower painters, was born into a modestly prosperous literati family. His first teacher was the great literatus, Wen Zhengming (1470-1559), and between 1519 and 1523 he studied at the Imperial Academy in Beijing. While initially influenced by the writing style of Wen Zhengming, Chen quickly developed a personal approach based more on the calligraphy of the ancient masters Mi Fu (1051-1107) and Yang Ningshi (873-954). His running and cursive scripts (<I>Cao-shu</I>) for which he is most famous display characteristic fluidity, boldness, and exuberance.\r\n<P>The frontispiece to the handscroll is written by Chen's friend and teacher Wen Zhengming, leader of the Wu school. Wen's four-character title reads:\r\n<P><I>Pai Yang (Chen Chun) the sage of cursive script</I>\r\n<P>In these three ancient poems Chen writes with the exuberant fluidity that made him, along with Zhu Yunming (1461-1527) and Wen Zhengming, one of the most important Ming masters of <I>Cao-shu</I> script.",
