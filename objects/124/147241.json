  "text": "Rich in cultural symbolism, Maynard Johnny's boldly designed color screenprint conveys the story of an orca, or killer whale, who encounters a young child whose canoe has overturned in a storm. The whale, taking on the role of protector, brings the child safely ashore. For Indigenous people, the orca symbolizes family, romance, longevity, harmony, travel, community and protection. Orcas are said to protect those who travel away from home, and to lead them back in due course. For Johnny, this story emphasizes the importance of protecting Indigenous youth, culture, and community so future generations will prosper.",
