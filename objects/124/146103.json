  "text": "A mezzotint is made by using a tool called a rocker to make small repetitive marks on the surface on a copper plate. The artist then smooths or scrapes down areas to create the design. When printed, the areas that were initially scratched with the rocker produce a velvety black, while the areas that were polished print lighter. Hamaguchi took advantage of the fuzzy appearance of the mezzotint, and further devised a way to add color—black, blue, red, and yellow. The colors of these cherries are the result of just four colors.",
