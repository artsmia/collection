  "text": "From the mid-18th century, a number of ukiyo-e artists designed prints that feature only children (kodomo-e, in Japanese). The prints were not intended for children, but rather for adults who enjoyed looking at images of innocent, happy children. Kuniyoshi designed a considerable number of kodomo-e, which reflects the playful and genial personality of the artist. In this image, he shows a group of young boys constructing the framework for a storehouse. He depicts them as experienced, confident carpenter-thus suggesting the charming way children mimic adults.",
