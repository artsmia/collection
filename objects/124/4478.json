  "text": "Round-back armchairs, used in more formal seating arrangements, were reserved for use by the highest-ranking members of a household. This one has extensively carved aprons (the wood just under the seat) and back splat (the vertical back support). The flower vase decorating the back splat is unusual, but at least three other chairs exist that have nearly identical carvings, suggesting that these chairs are part of a larger set.",
