  "text": "Sasai made this two-part sculpture when she was about twenty and still an undergraduate student. Her intent was to create eyes that seem to look at the artist inquisitively in an attempt to understand why she chose lacquer as her medium. She finished the object in about five months, decorating it with maki-e—different types of colored metal powders that she sprinkled on the soft lacquer before it hardened.",
