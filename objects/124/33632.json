  "text": "Produced by an amateur artist named Yu Yun-ai, for private circulation among his friends, this charming and unique two-volume painting manual contains 86 illustrations and accompanying poems by the author. The first volume entitled, The Fragrant Wind Filled the Branches, provides a step-by-step guide to the brushwork required for representing the four friends (orchid, bamboo, plum, and chrysanthemum), the four flower subjects favored by scholar painters. As with most manuals, the instructions are accompanied by model woodblock illustrations. The second volume is devoted to bonsai and landscape paintings. The woodblock illustrations are of outstanding quality for a private publication and the prints are made using different shades of black and grey in a technique known as chromatography.",
