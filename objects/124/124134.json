  "text": "Carved with consummate refinement and precision, this head of the Buddha has little trace of the Northern Wei slenderness characteristic of the faces of Buddha in northern China. Instead, it appears naturalistic and alive, and a typical product of Qingzhou in Shandong during the Northern Qi period. The subtle smile lighting its face, emits a compassion expected of the Buddha. The gaze is fixed on the nose, which indicates concentration, the calm face contemplating an inner life.",
