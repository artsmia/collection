  "text": "From his roots as a very humble gardener, Georg Ehret rose to become a designer of princely gardens as well as the most talented botanical illustrator of the mid-18th century. He traveled a great deal, producing hundreds of drawings of plants encountered along the way. Christoph Trew selected 100 of Ehret's most spectacular watercolors and enlisted skilled printmakers to make facsimiles. The resulting publication, Plantae Selectae, proved to be a revelation for a European public unaware of such exotic plants as bananas and pineapples.",
