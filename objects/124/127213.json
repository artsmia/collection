While undistinguished in appearance, this silver fish was an abundant source of food in the North Sea and supported a vast fishing industry in the Netherlands. Herring fishing accounted for such a large percentage of the wealth of the Dutch Republic that Amsterdam was said to have been built on herring bones.",
