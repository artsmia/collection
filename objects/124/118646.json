  "text": "Mark Taylor’s Box Set is an ingenious blend of personal narrative and trompe l’oeil deception. For this project, Taylor scanned worn record jackets and stripped them of their original texts and pictures using a graphics software program. He then enlarged and refitted the sleeves with song titles, graphics, and liner notes that he compiled over many years. The result is an abridged form of storytelling articulated through the organizational scheme of LP record albums.\r\n \r\nTaylor describes his approach as excavating the past for meaning: “I rob from the graveyard of pop culture and splice together new creations (screenprints, sculptures, videos, and collages) that feed off the history of cherished objects. I excavate, reuse and reanimate pop artifacts in service of a personal narrative. Set inside an increasingly virtual, digital universe cluttered with the remains of material culture, my work explores how possessions can also possess.”",
