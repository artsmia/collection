  "text": "Tina Blondell's Judith was inspired by Judith I by Gustav Klimt (1862-1918). From that seductress lost in ecstasy, Blondell created a forthright figure who is all surface. As with the other women in her Fallen Angels series, she gave Judith spiral-patterned flesh, using the spiral as a symbol of renewal after a state of degeneration. Thus a winged Judith has transformed her experiences of deception and self-sacrifice into an exquisite map that, in Blondell's words, is symbolically revealed on her body.",
