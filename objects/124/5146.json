  "text": "This fan painting by Hong Wu, grandson of the Kangxi emperor (1654–1722), reveals his refinement as poet, calligrapher, and painter. Rendered in gold against a dark background, the scene depicts bamboo and chrysanthemums, plants rich in symbolism. Bamboo, steadfast and upright, signifies integrity and moral strength, while chrysanthemums—beloved by the poet Tao Yuanming (365–427), who retired to a life of rustic seclusion—represent purity, endurance, and the recluse’s spirit. In invoking Tao, Hong Wu aligned himself with the literati (scholar-artist) ideal of withdrawal from worldly concerns. His inscription and brushwork unite painting, poetry, and calligraphy, embodying the cultivated virtues of Chinese scholarly tradition.",
