  "text": "After graduating from college, Hoshino Satoru abandoned his chosen field of economics to pursue his passion for ceramics. He joined Sōdeisha, a society of artists devoted to exploring non‑traditional ceramics. In 1973, he and his spouse—the ceramicist Hoshino Kayoko—founded an independent studio. After a landslide destroyed their studio in 1986, Hoshino discarded his precise, carefully controlled approach in favor of a much more visceral process in which he leaves deep impressions of his fingers and thumbs in clay as evidence of his interaction and conflict with nature. For this work, he was inspired by large clay jars from Japan’s prehistoric past. Building the jar with a thick spiral of clay, he continued the pattern on the surrounding walls to suggest nature’s energy as it fluctuates between chaos and order.",
