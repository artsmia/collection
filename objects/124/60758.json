  "text": "Wooden bowls were an integral part of traditional life for the tribal groups of the Plains and Great Lakes/Woodlands regions. Carved by men, they were used primarily for utilitarian and ceremonial purposes; decorated examples were highly regarded.  The head on this bowl probably represents Eyah, the spirit of eating heartily.  Carving an image of Eyah on a bowl reinforced the custom of consuming large amounts of offered food.",
