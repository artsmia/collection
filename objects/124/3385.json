The piper’s rain hat is of a style typically made of pandan leaves and worn by women. The stylized snake carvings on the skirt represent the woman’s connection to the spiritual world. Serpents appear frequently in New Ireland art because of the supernatural powers attributed to them. This figure likely portrays a clan ancestor for whom a <i>Malagan</i> ceremony was held.</span>\n</p>\n<font face=Times New Roman size=3>  </font>",
