  "text": "This potpourri box, produced during the late Ming dynasty, is characterized by extraordinary craftsmanship and a complex structure. It can be disassembled by removing the upper pins on the U-shaped handle. The box consists of a large upper drawer and five smaller drawers below. The unit on the lower left is constructed of drawers in three tiers. The box is made in openwork, which allows for the potpourri fragrance to escape. The exterior surface is decorated with squirrels among grapes (a symbol of inherited prosperity) and lotus blossoms (a symbol of the purity of Buddhism).",
