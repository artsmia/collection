Among the heaviest currencies in Africa—this one weighs a hefty 39 1/4 pounds (17.8 kg)—it was used primarily in matrimonial payments by the Nigerian Angas and Afo peoples. A groom would offer several blades to his bride’s relatives in recognition of and compensation for her ability to bear children and ensure the continuity of his lineage.",
