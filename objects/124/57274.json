  "text": "In Wanda Gág’s day, New Yorkers traveled up and down Manhattan by trains running on elevated tracks. (It’s doubtful the thrifty Gág ever splurged on the nickel fare.) This charming wooden railway station was at Columbus and 81st Street. Filtered through Gág’s idiosyncratic inner vision, it has been transformed into a gangly creature pulsing with energy. About ten years after this print was made, the elevated train lines began to close, replaced by the subway.",
