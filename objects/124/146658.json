  "text": "Selva blanca is one of the most ambitious works by Chiachio & Giannone, intricately designed and richly embroidered through their handwork. The textile resembles a mural decorated with chinoiserie, an 18th-century decorative style inspired by Chinese porcelain, and as such is a prime example of their encompassing interest in global art history and trade. At the same time, the work reflects the depth of their research into relevant source material for the flora; in fact, it is possible to identify some tropical species amongst the plants, yet another allusion to the so-called “exotic” origins of their work and identity as Latin American. Additionally, and importantly, small geometrically patterned rugs are scattered around the piece as an homage to women artists who worked in the field of textile design, such as Sonia Delaunay and Anni Albers. Deliberately blurring the boundaries of authorship and inclusive of gendered labor, Selva Blanca elevates the art of embroidery. Through a profusion of signs, and by centering upon the creators’ own queer family, the work itself is a celebration of the same.",
