He settled in Lindsborg, Kansas, where he held a lifelong professorship at Bethany College. \r\n\r\nSandzén's technique is marked by a rich, inventive, high-key colorism executed in a pointillist style. His work is inspired by the landscape of the western United States, from summers spent in Colorado, Utah, and New Mexico.",
