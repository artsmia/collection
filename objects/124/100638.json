  "text": "Payne loved to paint the dramatic landscapes of the southwestern United States. One of his favorite locations was Canyon de Chelly, an 18-mile-long desert canyon in northeastern Arizona. <i>Canyon Portal</i> shows the massive red sandstone cliffs marking the entrance—striking rock formations that surely looked exotic to viewers from the eastern United States and Europe. Overwhelmed by this powerful landscape, two small figures on horseback make humans seem insignificant.",
