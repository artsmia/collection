  "text": "Collected and displayed by Chinese literati, scholar’s rocks embody the harmony between nature and imagination. Valued for their dramatic forms, textured surfaces, and symbolic resonance, these stones served as meditative objects on scholars’ desks—miniature landscapes evoking vast mountains, eroded cliffs, or caverns shaped by wind and water. This example, with its jagged peaks and perforated hollows, invites reflection on nature’s rhythms and the scholar’s desire to live in harmony with the world. Such rocks also offered a mental escape, allowing the scholar to envision distant landscapes while remaining at his desk. Mounted on a wooden base echoing garden architecture, it transforms the scholar’s studio into a portable retreat—a world within a stone.",
