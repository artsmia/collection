  "text": "Friedensreich Hundertwasser (born Friedrich Stowasser) was an acclaimed Austrian painter, printmaker, architect, and designer whose work was strongly informed by the example of Gustav Klimt and other artists of the Vienna Secession, a modernist art movement that rejected traditional academic art and instead promoted aesthetic innovation in contemporary art and design. Like the secessionists, Hundertwasser expressed a passion for asymmetry, labyrinthine spirals, and arabesque lines, assailing the modern industrial “straight line” world that he called “the rotten foundation of our doomed civilization.” For both his visual art and architectural projects, Hundertwasser incorporated asymmetrical designs, intense color, elaborate ornamentation, and organic forms as a prominent features.",
