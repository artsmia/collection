  "text": "This transitional work links Hayashi's earlier unglazed geometric sculptures, with his later glazed and inlaid optical abstractions (on view in this gallery). The carefully controlled application of glaze to the surrounding form creates an atmospheric background from which the undulating unglazed central form seems to emerge and recede. This visual ambiguity fascinated Hayashi and quickly became an important aspect of his ceramic sculptures.",
