  "text": "Dehn was born and raised in Minnesota and grew up to travel the world throughout his life. In the 1940’s, Standard Oil commissioned him to make drawings and watercolors in Mexico and Venezuela. Although asked to depict industrial activities, Dehn strayed and was more captivated by the natural environment and local communities. This scene shows his meticulous attention to the color and feeling of place. He once remarked, My attitude to life is rather sinuous - and sensual too…Putting it simply: when I am fed up, I work. I am crazy about life and want to have as much out of it as I can. Take away my work and I lose interest in life, yet the work comes after my living life, or rather out of it.",
