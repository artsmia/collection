  "text": "Francesco Bolgiè created delicate neoclassical reliefs that reference ancient Greek and Roman painting and sculpture. Wax models such as this one served as patterns for intricately carved designs destined to grace a wooden wall panel, picture frame, or piece of furniture. Bolgiè worked with the better-known designer Giuseppe Maria Bonzanigo to decorate and furnish complete rooms for the royal palaces of the Savoy family, including the Palazzo Reale in Turin and the royal hunting lodge. The carved adornment on a secretary-bookcase from the hunting lodge closely resembles this modeled wax panel.",
