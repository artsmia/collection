  "text": "Acclaimed book artist and typographer Russell Maret embraces the fine art of letterpress printing in this exquisitely produced illustrated volume that explores Euclidean geometry from an unusual perspective. His most ambitious book project to date, Interstices & Intersections is based on Euclid’s Elements, a highly influential third century BCE treatise on geometry that consists of 13 books containing a total of 465 propositions and proofs. In Maret’s book, the study of geometry is considered from both a logical and personal perspective, with color illustrations and commentary provided by the artist. For this contemplation on Euclid, Maret chose to explore a single proposition for each of the thirteen books. He noted that they were chosen “not for their relationship to each other but for their relevance in my life.”",
