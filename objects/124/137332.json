  "text": "Faith Ringgold’s sculpture was inspired by the 1974 discovery in Hadar, Ethiopia, of “Lucy, ” a partial female skeleton belonging to an extinct species in human ancestry, Australopithecus afarensis. This important archaeological find located in both space and time the shift to upright walking on two legs, a hallmark of human evolution. News of “Lucy” inspired Ringgold to travel to Africa in 1976. Fabrics she gathered on this trip, along with items acquired from Ringgold’s mother, a former fashion designer, were included in the sculpture. The work is reminiscent of an open casket which contains an effigy of Lucy flanked by miniature vases displaying fabric flowers.",
