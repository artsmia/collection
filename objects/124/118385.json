  "text": "This head was once part of a monumental bronze sculpture of a group of four guardian figures known collectively as the Caturmahārāja, or Four Heavenly Kings. Known in Japanese as Shitennō, they guard the four cardinal directions. These protective deities are believed to safeguard the world and Buddhist teachings from evil, and are usually represented as muscular warriors wearing elaborate suits of armor and carrying weapons and other objects. Although each of the guardians is depicted with unique implements and appearances, this figure’s specific identity is unknown, since only the head remains.",
