  "text": "Painter and printmaker Russell Limbach worked as the Art Editor of The New Masses, a publication tied to the Communist Party, and subsequently organized the Graphics Division of the WPA Arts Project in New York. Many of his prints are witty reflections on middle-class American life. In Tourists at Niagra Falls, no one looks at the natural wonder before them. An amateur photographer’s camera seems uncooperative at the big moment. A woman urges her grandson to look, but he seems more interested in the couple who seem a little less than loving.",
