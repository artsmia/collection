  "text": "In this engraving, James Siena explores patterning through the use of rule-based mathematical logic, something he calls “visual algorithms.” Merging idea with image, he methodically follows a set of pre-determined instructions that dictate the physical movement of the engraving burin on the copper printing plate. These directives, executed entirely by hand, are responsible for producing a repeating starburst design that makes up the dynamic, shimmering surface of this print, one that appeals equally to mind and eye.",
