  "text": "Gardening, like many outdoor hobbies, is not always associated with or afforded to Black men. The Red Hat is a striking portrait of a Black man sitting in a garden. Many of Peterson's figures are proxies for the Minneapolis-based artist himself. Here a gentleman gazes into the distance, lost in thought and surrounded by signs of cultivation. The artist's iconic graphic aesthetic recalls both sketching and coloring books, invoking private moments of creativity and respite. Peterson's work gives the viewer a glimpse into a private moment of contemplation, reflection, and respite that is rarely shown in American culture.",
