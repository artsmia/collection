  "text": "Yokoi Kinkoku painted in a rapid and spontaneous manner and was especially successful in capturing the vibrancy of mountains and rocks. Toward the end of his life he became a wandering Buddhist priest of the Jōdo (Pure Land) school. Irregularly and richly shaped, the mountains go high up in the painting. Black ink dotting and lively outlines give the rocks a rich texture.",
