  "text": "This monumental landscape shows a lively scene. In the panel on the right, a high-ranking man on horseback, possibly the emperor, receives a message from a kneeling figure. Behind him, a gathering of elegant noblewomen, also on horseback, look on. In the left panel, a group of scholars—separated by a rocky outcropping—engage in conversation. The painting may suggest that leaders, in order to rule effectively, must strike a balance between work and play—consulting with scholars and picnicking with women or hunting (shown in the lower part of the painting).",
