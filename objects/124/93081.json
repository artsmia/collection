  "text": "This fine ivory hat stand has curved legs that have been pierced and carved as archaic dragons. The central boss is decorated with three incised <I>shou</I> (long life) characters surrounded by a cap also carved with a <I>shou</I> character. Made to accompany a traveling scholar official, this stand is cleverly disguised with legs that lock in position by the bayonet fitting on the cap to provide a wide and stable stand for the hat. It is also dismountable to pack flat for safe traveling.",
