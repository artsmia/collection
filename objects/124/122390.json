  "text": "Long-necked jars like this one, which features an opening on the side, have been excavated from sites that are generally dated to the prehistoric Kofun period (250–650). The opening was probably used as a spout for pouring liquids. This type of vessel originated in Korea and likely was adopted in Japan between 300 and 400 CE.",
