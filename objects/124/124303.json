  "text": "This youthful monk Ananda is sculpted with a slightly inclined head and abdomen. It stands straight with his hands raised in a gesture of prayer. The garment is worn in an open mode, covering the left shoulder, leaving the right shoulder bare. The white marble enhances a youthful, almost innocent face. The visual impact of the white marble was originally enhanced by coloured and gilt paint. Both the material (white marble) and style of sculpture identifies the statue as being a product of Quyang in Hebei.",
