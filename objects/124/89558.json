  "text": "Artist commentary: <I>One thousand years later the Hmong people who had migrated to the south built another kingdom. The kingdom was called “San Miao” (Peb Hmoob). In Chinese it means “Three Hmong.” In Hmong it means “Us Hmong.” The Chinese expansion eventually caught up to the Hmong Kingdom. There we fought another great war. We lost again. The migration continued further south, close to the borders of Laos, Thailand, Vietnam and Burma.</I>",
