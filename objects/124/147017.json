  "text": "In the 11th and 12th centuries, artisans in and around the city of Amol in northern Iran near the Caspian Sea, coated the forms they produced from rough, reddish clay with a creamy white slip. To decorate their vessels, they scratched patterns in the white slip and applied colorful glazes. Here the artist has rendered a lively feline, with raised forepaws and tail held jauntily upwards. The sense of vitality is enhanced by the artist’s rendering of the creature's fur as a series of whorls. Adding to the naive charm, the artist depicted the feline’s nose and eyes as three starbursts. The animal is surrounded by swirling whorls of brown pigment, interspersed with colorful tri-lobed, green manganese motifs–possibly meant to represent foliage. The overall use of pattern creates a rhythmic balance with the prancing creature, while dabs of brown glaze along the edge of the bowl results in a scalloped effect.",
