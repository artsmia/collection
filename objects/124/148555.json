  "text": "Beginning in the mid-1960s, conceptual artist Barry Le Va created text-based artworks that invite viewers to perform tasks that involve changing, recombining, or sometimes even destroying different materials. In Cycle Piece he invites viewers to boil three cups of water and three cups of coffee while observing the time it takes for each to evaporate completely. The task is simple, maybe even absurd. But it exemplifies Le Va’s efforts to foreground the intellectual and physical processes of making art, as opposed to the finished object itself. This was a goal that he shared with many leading conceptual artists of his era, including Robert Smithson, Ed Ruscha, and George Maciunas of Fluxis.\n\nLe Va created Cycle Piece while teaching at the Minneapolis College of Art and Design. He gifted the work to his colleague, the renowned Iranian American artist and architect Siah Armajani.",
