  "text": "Brazilian-born artist Arthur Luis Piza is a noted painter, collagist, and printmaker best known for his color etchings and engravings that feature deep texture and abstract pattern as compositional elements. Piza initially trained as a painter in the studio of Brazilian modernist Antonio Gomide (1895–1967), but moved to Paris in the early 1950s, where he learned color intaglio printmaking from German-born artist Johnny Friedlaender. Piza subsequently developed his signature method of burin engraving that employs multiple deeply incised and gouged copper plates, a technique seen in the present abstract intaglio print. Piza is generally associated with the Latin American geometric constructivist movement based in Paris.",
