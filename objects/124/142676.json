  "text": "As every parent of small children knows, dusk is a time of fraught emotions, wordlessly exhibited in the stacks of dinner dishes on the table, damp towels beside the bathtub, and the chaos of toys strewn across rugs by young ones unready for bedtime.  Halaban’s quiet view into one such evening in Paris illuminates the care thrumming beneath such domestic exhaustion: a mother in her slip stands before a child, her hand reaching toward their shoulder with affection.  The soft glow of their untidy apartment within the larger frame—filled with the luminous blue and greying landscape of twilight—amplifies the warmth of the parent-child connection.  In this way, Halaban provides a view into the daily routines of caregiving, in all of their intimacy and exhaustion.",
