  "text": "Lucienne Day was one of the foremost textile designers in post-war Britain. She is credited with pioneering contemporary design in the furnishings textile industry with her introduction of the fabric <I>Calyx</I> in 1952. Her use of abstracted floral forms startled, yet attracted consumers and inspired imitations by her competitors.\r\n\r\nAlthough Day worked strictly as a free-lance designer, she maintained a long-term relationship with Heal & Sons, one of Britain's largest textile manufacturers. <I>Petal</I>, produced in 1972, was one of her last designs for Heal's. Created at the end of the Flower Power era, its imagery is less experimental than her earlier work but still conveys her interest in creating a sense of motion. In the early 1970s design became more conservative and less appreciative of modern trends, prompting Day to leave the industrial design arena in 1975.",
