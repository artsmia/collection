  "text": "This costume study for a civil official exemplifies the French Revolution’s utopian spirit. The Committee of Public Safety assigned Jacques-Louis David the ambitious task of reinventing the way French people dressed. He was to design clothes “more appropriate to republican morals and to the character of the Revolution, ” not just for government officials and the military but for the average French citizen as well. David completed the commission swiftly, producing a series of sharply drawn studies representing fanciful ensembles that blended influences of antique sculpture, military regalia, and theater.\r\n\r\nJohn Moore, a Scotsman briefly residing in Paris in 1792, described David’s fashion designs—and their first fashion victims—in his journal.\r\n\r\nPart of this dress is already adopted by many; but I have only seen one person in public completely equipped with the whole; and as he had managed it, his appearance was rather fantastical. . . . He is a tall man, and of a very warlike figure; I took him for a Major of Dragoons at least: on enquiry I find he is a miniature painter.",
