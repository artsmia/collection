  "text": "Lorna Simpson combines images and text to create narratives open to multiple interpretations. The images here—a cropped portrait of an anonymous black woman, a brick smokehouse that once sheltered enslaved Africans, and braided hair arranged in concentric rings—are accompanied by numerical notations and times of day, representing methods of counting. Simpson invites the viewer to contemplate the experiences of African Americans in various locations across time.",
