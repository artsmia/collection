  "text": "Mabel Hewit likely met the potter Rosita on a trip to Mexico or Guatemala in the 1950s. Notice how her rounded hat echoes the pots piled behind her. As the color-stained woodblock indicates, Hewit printed Rosita from a single block, carving grooves to keep adjacent colors from mixing. These grooves print white, hence the term “white-line woodcut.”\r\n\r\nHewit learned the technique in 1933 in Provincetown, Massachusetts, where it originated. An analysis of 33 surviving Hewit blocks revealed that she apparently used cast-off wood from lumber mills, construction sites, and furniture makers. The thrifty Hewit usually carved both sides of a block; the back of this one has a farming scene.",
