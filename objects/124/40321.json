Wijdeveld is known for his innovative technique of using printers’ brass rules to create the letters and geometric ornaments in his designs. His combination of oversized typeface and bold decorative borders, seen in this poster, became known as the Wendingen Style and influenced design in the Netherlands for decades.",
