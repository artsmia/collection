  "text": "Elegantly posed with jeweled festoons suspended from his belt, hanging ear ornaments, and an elaborately domed hair arrangement (<i>jatamukata</i>), Shiva, the Hindu god of destruction and regeneration, is shown flanked by worshipful celestial couples. Shiva’s dynamic triple-bend pose (<i>tribhanga</i>)—at neck, hips, and knees—is related to the prescribed motions and gestures of classical Indian dance. South Asian sculptors were less interested in strict anatomical accuracy than the portrayal of a flawless and supple divine body. This statue is probably from the exterior wall of a temple dedicated to Shiva.",
