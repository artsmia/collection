The series depicted stubs Hernmarck collected as souvenirs over the course of her daily life. The fragments shown here were proof of entry to Haddon Hall, a historic property located in Bakewell, Derbyshire, in central England. Hernmarck’s husband, American industrial designer Niels Diffrient, was her companion on this excursion.",
