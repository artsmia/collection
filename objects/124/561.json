  "text": "As with the highly embroidered chasubles shown in this gallery, this mitre, or Catholic ceremonial headdress, brought attention to the bishop who wore it, evoking the powerful presence of his status in front of a sizable congregation. Paradoxically, it is covered with a tour de force of non-religious but internationally stylish decoration. These include large, colorful motifs visible from a distance: Asian-inspired dragons and guardian lions and naturalistically depicted flowers and butterflies.",
