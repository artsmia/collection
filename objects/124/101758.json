  "text": "J. H. Field was a leading naturalistic photography, working from the turn of the twentieth century until about 1930. Based in Arkansas, he focused almost entirely on landscapes, sometimes with figures and always under misty conditions. The MIA rediscovered his work for its 2008 exhibition on American naturalistic photography, which included these two pieces. They and seven others are being given by Field's granddaughter, the only known source of his photographs.",
