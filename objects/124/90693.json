  "text": "The antiquarian aesthetic and introspective atmosphere of both the northern and southern Song dynasties (960-1279) is reflected in the quiet elegance of this small censer possibly intended for the scholar's table. The grayish-bodied, porcelaneous stoneware of the Dongchuan district in Shanxi province was known as <I>Yaozhou</I> ware and was commonly referred to as northern celadon. This rare vessel takes the archaic form of an ancient bronze <I>ding</I> tripod. The body is molded with complex, square fretwork, key fret and s scroll bands vaguely simulating the interlocking patterns cast into the ancient ceremonial bronzes. A vessel such as this would have been perfectly at home in a Song dynasty scholar's studio. The eleventh and twelfth centuries were a period of intense academic interest in the ancient bronzes of Shang (1766-1122 BCE) and Zhou (1122-221 BCE). Scholar's taste tended toward works such as this that recalled China's ancient past.",
