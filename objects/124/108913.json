  "text": "“Trim closely the moustache and grow the beard.” This was the grooming guidance of Muhammad, founder of Islam in the 7th century, as recorded in the Hadith, a collection of his sayings. Muhammad wore a beard and encouraged his male followers to do the same, so they could be distinguished from non-Muslims. The beard should be a fist long, oiled, and tamed with a beard comb like this elegant ivory example from Somalia, its knob reminiscent of a mosque.",
