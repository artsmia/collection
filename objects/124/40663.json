  "text": "This flawlessly executed example of polychrome carved lacquer is most likely a product of the imperial workshops. The lid is decorated on top with a large basket holding various auspicious objects and emitting rays of light in support of a giant <I>chun</I> (spring) character, which is flanked on both sides by a five-clawed dragon frolicking amongst clouds. In the center of the chun character is a roundel enclosing the Daoist immortal Shoulao seated under a pine tree beside a reclining deer. In short, the complex design symbolizes a wish of wealth, long life, and eternal spring for the emperor. The four sides are carved in meticulous detail with a continuous narrative of scholars in a landscape. \r\n\r\nThe <I>chun</I> motif first appeared in imperial lacquer during the Jiaqing reign (1522-66) of the Ming dynasty but soon went into eclipse. In 1743, the Qianlong emperor (r. 1736-95) rated these <I>chun</I> boxes as superior objects and in 1758 he placed a special order for twelve of them. <I>Chun</I> was an important imperial motif of the eighteenth century. Comprised of complex imagery, extremely fine patterns, and multiple colors, the <I>chun</I> emblem provided master carvers the perfect vehicle to demonstrate their technical virtuosity.",
