  "text": "Rauschenberg produced seven lithographs  during his first year at U.L.A.E. Among these editions was a three-print series called Stunt Man (I, II, and III), so named for the artist's attempt to blend unlikely combinations of color, something he considered a brash stunt. In these early prints, Rauschenberg arranged seemingly unrelated images-typically cut from newspapers and magazines of the day-in a collaged composition on which he painted gestural brushstrokes using lithographic tusche. The resulting lithograph was an amalgam of abstract and representational imagery, which often yielded unforeseen results. Indeed, Rauschenberg often relied on chance and unforeseen connections among images as a crucible for new and multiple meanings.",
