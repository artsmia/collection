  "text": "One of O_kyo's great innovations was to sketch directly from nature. This approach, together with his interest in anatomy, led to works imbued with Western realism. Even when O_kyo painted in the traditional broad brush manner, as seen here, his use of foreshortening gave his subjects a convincing degree of volume. While O_kyo painted a wide range of subjects, including figures, animals, and landscapes, his lighthearted portrayals of gamboling puppies are particularly numerous.",
