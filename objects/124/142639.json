  "text": "A rare pot of unknown function whose maker we are not sure about—that is what you are looking at. What we see is a strikingly decorated and colored bottle-shaped vessel collected in Rwanda, in Central Africa. Said to have belonged to the court of the Tutsi aristocracy, it may well have been made by a Ge-Sera potter for the Tutsi. The Ge-Sera, short-statured peoples who originally inhabited the area, are accomplished potters. They are often referred to as “Twa, ” a term used by their neighbors that means either “little people” or “bush people.”",
