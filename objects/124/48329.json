  "text": "Hans Holbein's Dance of Death is the most famous treatment of the subject in Renaissance art. His series of 50 miniature woodcuts show Death's affinity for all stations in life, royal and religious officials not excepted. Holbein's highly animated images remained unpublished for 15 years. Perhaps they were considered too inflammatory during the 1520s, a period of class warfare when even peasants rejected the notion of the divine right of kings.",
