  "text": "Though this little girl is identified as Mademoiselle Luquet, the work can hardly be called a portrait. Rather than representing an individual child, Mary Cassatt seems more interested in capturing the distinguishing characteristics of childhood in general—the physical and emotional qualities, the small scale, and the innocence. Cassatt was superbly skilled at depicting children. Here, aside from her delicate profile and left foot, this girl’s tiny being is enveloped in a grown-up, stylish fur-trimmed coat and large hat. Cassatt emphasized her short stature and vulnerability by showing her from above.",
