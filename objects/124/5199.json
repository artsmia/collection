  "text": "Jan Vonck's painting, <I>Still Life of Dead Birds</I>, and Jeff Millikan's photograph, <I>The Birds Were Too Beautiful to Remove</I>, were created three centuries apart in different cultural contexts. Yet, they both offer an example of a <I>momento mori</I>, a symbolic representation of the fact that we all die. Indeed, what is more common and resolute among cultures than death?  Both artists present images of dead birds: Vonck lays them out neatly on a table while Millikan carefully piles them at the base of a window frame. Vonck's birds are certainly not too beautiful. Loosely painted with brown and black colors, they suggest a brooding and depressing atmosphere. On the other hand, Millikan's colorful birds suggest a more poetic and euphoric notion of death…<I>too beautiful</I>. Indeed, visual traditions, such as the <I>momento mori</I>, pass from one culture and time to another, but their translation is a reminder that differences are as important as continuities.",
