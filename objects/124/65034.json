  "text": "As comic entertainment, shadow performances were among the many diversions, including music and dance, offered at teahouse parties during the Edo period. In the eleven-print series <I>Improvised Shadow Performances</I>, Hiroshige depicted figures making shadows on <I>shōji</I> screens by contorting their bodies. The images demonstrate how to create ingenious shadows and could easily have been used as a how-to guide for clever shadow making.",
