  "text": "Full-length vests or sleeveless coats were popular outer garments among aristocratic Manchu women. They were worn over elegant court robes and typically decorated with auspicious imagery. This bright example is decorated with four lively ascending dragons who writhe among colorful clouds. The dragons each have five claws, indicating the owner’s husband may have held a high rank in court. Below the dragons are swirling, stylized waves.",
