Originally designed for patients at a nursing home, this recliner can be easily adjusted by moving a rod between the circular knobs on the back arms of the chair. Hoffmann created a chair that allows both its construction and function to be visible. \r\n\r\nThis Sitzmaschine (Sitting Machine) embodies the Wiener Werkstätte’s (Vienna Workshops’) emphasis on clean craftsmanship, geometric form, and material integrity.",
