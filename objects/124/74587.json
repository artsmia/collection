  "text": "Here the satyrs' music is mournful, for the partially draped satyress at the bottom center appears to have lost her mate. We see the end view of the coffin beneath the stairs where two more grieving satyrs sit. An orchestra and chorus of satyrs occupy the lofty balcony that arcs around the pyramid of the catafalque.  Jean Le Pautre and Jean Berain were both extremely prolific designers of ornament that covered surface of everything from tabletops to tapestries in the homes of French aristocrats and royalty.",
