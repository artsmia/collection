  "text": "William Henry Hunt was celebrated for his exquisitely detailed watercolor still lifes, which elevated humble subjects through remarkable technique. Here he captures the delicacy of the grapes and the rough texture of the gourd with dazzling precision. Hunt’s mastery of light and surface creates a quiet, contemplative scene that reflects Victorian tastes for naturalism and moral simplicity. Fond of rustic subjects, he helped establish watercolor as a serious artistic medium.",
