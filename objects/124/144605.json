  "text": "For more than four decades, Sue Coe has merged art and activism to expose injustices and abuses of power in the United States and elsewhere. A firebrand social progressive, Coe sees her graphic art as a conduit for political action, producing editioned images at low cost to spread her messages to a wide, global audience. In this scene of mass violence, Coe reminds us that dehumanizing rhetoric is the language of dictators, who rely on fear and division to achieve and maintain power.",
