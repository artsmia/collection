  "text": "In the early 1960s, Jack Larsen and designer Win Anderson traveled to Africa, where they were inspired by a number of indigenous textile traditions. The two designers also found a new textile enterprise in Swaziland weaving with handspun mohair. This discovery led the Larsen design team to create a distinctive line of fabrics particularly noted for their translucence and superb draping quality, as shown in this casement cloth.",
