  "text": "The first state is defined by having lines in knees of the figure at right. Variation C has the sky dark at the top as well as at the horizon. Lane 1982 does not mention this which makes it appear to be extremely rare.\r\n\r\nThis print belongs to Utagawa Hiroshige’s first and most celebrated series of landscapes along Japan’s main arterial road, the Tōkaidō. The Tōkaidō (Eastern Sea Route) connected Edo (present-day Tokyo) with Kyoto over more than three hundred miles, and post stations were set up along the way to relay messages and provide accommodation for travelers. Even though Hiroshige himself had yet to travel along the Tōkaidō, in this series he successfully emphasized the scenic aspect of the road. The series led to Hiroshige’s rise from an unknown print designer to the foremost creator of landscape prints in the mid-nineteenth century.",
