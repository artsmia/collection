  "text": "This handmade lamp expresses Seppo Koho’s philosophy that “[t]he viewer should not be blinded by the light. On the contrary, the light should softly invite people to come closer.” Its open shade is constructed of laminated birch slats held together by plywood rings of the kind used in the aircraft industry. This combination helps produce a modulated warm light through a screen without blocking interior views.",
