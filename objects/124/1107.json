  "text": "The <I>gu</I> is a tall wine beaker with an unusually taut and graceful silhouette—its trumpet-shaped top tapers to a slim center section before widening again to a slightly flared base. Archaeological evidence reveals that bronze <I>gu</I> first appeared during the Erligang period (c. 1500–1300 BCE) of the Shang dynasty. The <I>gu</I> enjoyed its greatest popularity during the Shang dynasty (c. 1600–1046 BCE), but became less popular in the early Western Zhou (c. 1046–977 BCE), before gradually disappearing during the Eastern Zhou dynasty (770–256 BCE). The gradual decline of the wine vessel may have something to do with the Zhou king’s deprecation of alcohol consumption—he believed that overindulgence in alcohol resulted in the collapse of Shang. This <I>gu</I> is decorated with variations of the <I>taotie</I> (composite animal) mask. The background pattern of tight spirals, found all over the vessel, is called <I>leiwen</I> and is a hallmark of Shang bronze casting.",
