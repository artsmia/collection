  "text": "Nature is an important theme in Katsushiro’s works; “Sunset Glow” (Yūbae) was designed to evoke the movement of wind across rice fields and shallow water over stones. This piece was created with an unusual technique combining bundled plaiting (yose ami) with twisted twill plaiting (hineri ajiro ami) for which Katsushiro used opened and flattened susudake bamboo, a thin, smoked bamboo of 1 ½ to 2 inches in diameter. In 2007, a similar work also made of lacquered bamboo was admitted to the 54th Exhibition of Japanese Traditional Art Crafts (Nihon dentō kōgei ten). Although it is unusual for an artist to make records in this way, Katsushiro wrote explicitly on the paulownia boxes made for this work and the work submitted to the exhibition that they were made of bamboo from Shino.",
