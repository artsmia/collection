  "text": "Varuna is one of several Hindu gods adopted into Buddhism to serve as guardians of the faith. Associated with water, Varuna is usually shown with a crown of seven water serpents. In this case, he also holds a bowl from which emerges a snake.\r\n\r\nAs an expression of religious piety, well-to-do Buddhists commissioned elaborately painted images using rare and precious materials. Ordinary people, however, purchased inexpensive images mass produced by Buddhist monks from carved woodblocks. Such images were often tightly folded and tucked into small, fabric pouches to be carried as a protective amulets.",
