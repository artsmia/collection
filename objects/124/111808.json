  "text": "The short beard, pointed nose, and wrapped turban decorated with amulets represent a Muslim cleric. For more than three centuries, Yoruba people have been in contact with Islam and many now practice the faith, occasionally incorporating it into local religious traditions. This mask, for instance, appeared in a performance called Gelede, which celebrates the power of women. The finely carved details and evidence of repainting suggest this was a highly respected—and well-used—mask.",
