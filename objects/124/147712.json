  "text": "Ann Morgan designed this playfully surreal illustration as the cover design for the 1985 Secrets issue of the longrunning underground zine Artpolice. The scene features two anonymous doll-like figures, one inserting a key into the mouth of its companion. Instead of color, Morgan uses various contrasting patterns to differentiate the elements of the scene, including the simple but effective spiral device she added to the background.",
