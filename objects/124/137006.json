  "text": "This is an unusually tall pot made by a female Igbo potter, possibly to contain water or palm wine. When filled with liquid, however, it would be close to impossible to move. It may therefore have been used as a ritual vessel, on a shrine. In Igbo culture, one cannot tell the difference between ritual and secular pottery just by looking at it: a vessel may change its function, moving from one category to the other depending on circumstances.",
