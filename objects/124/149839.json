  "text": "<p><font face=Mia Post Grotesk size=5>Kiki Smith has long demonstrated a fascination with traditional chlldren's stories and folk tales, many featuring young-girl heroines who overcome their fears amid the anxieties and vulnerabilities of childhood. Companion features a series of black-and-white and color lithographic illustrations inspired by Charles Perrault's classic fairy tale &quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot;, also known as &quot;Little Red Cap.&quot; Smith's double-sided accordion-fold book presents the story's protagonist--the Little Girl--together with her animal adversary, the Big Bad Wolf. The young girl (whose features resemble Smith's own) appears in multiple images, each a variant showing her walking with a basket of food on her arm, some aside the wolf. Though the girl appears calm, the scene foreshadows the horror that lies ahead. According to the story's narrative, as Little Red Riding Hood walks through a forest with food and wine for her ailing grandmother, a wolf disguises itself as the little girl as a ruse to gain entry to the grandmother's house, where he promptly attacks and smallows her whole. The wolf then lies in wait <font face=Mia Post Grotesk size=5>for the girl's arrival, where she meets the same fate. Originating in pre-17th-century Europe, the tale has been repeatedly revised over generations. Some versions include a woodsman, who rescues the little girl and her grandmother by cutting open the belly of the wolf.</font>\n</font></p>",
