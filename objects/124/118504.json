  "text": "The term “Eight Immortals Indulged in Wine” (Chinese: yinzhong baxian; Japanese: inchū hassen) refers not to the Eight Immortals, but to a group of Tang-dynasty scholars known for their love of alcoholic beverages. “Immortal” is used here humorously. These scholars revered the Eight Immortals, legendary Daoist beings said to have attained immortality through their studies of nature’s secrets, thus gaining, through their wisdom and virtue, supernatural powers such as invisibility. This painting shows the scholars dressed in the Chinese style of the Tang period (618–907), with long sleeves and scholars’ hats. In keeping with their scholarly gathering, they are enjoying wine together as well as the practices of painting, calligraphy, and poetry.",
