  "text": "Madame Juliette Récamier (1777–1849) was famous in revolutionary France for her beauty and charm. She married a wealthy older banker at 15, hosted fashionable salons, and carried on numerous affairs. Joseph Chinard’s renowned bust of her inspired numerous copies, some by Chinard’s hand, some by his workshop, and countless more made by others later in the century. In appearance and style, Récamier personified the neoclassical era. She reportedly wore flowing white dresses and elaborate <i>all’antica </i>updos. Chinard’s bust unusually includes arms and hands, which ingeniously disguise the pedestal, while introducing the conceit of modesty. Récamier vainly tries to cover her breasts with her sheer, slipping drapery. Subtle movements bring the sculpture to life: the turn of the head, downward glance, and grasping fingers.",
