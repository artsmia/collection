  "text": "This colorful painting bears an inscription in a red cartouche in the upper left, identifying the two persons depicted as “numinous treasure emissaries who transmit speech, riding on a tiger and dragon.” Numinous treasure refers to Daoist scriptures, the blue books being carried down from heaven by attendants of the emissaries, who themselves are carried on a tiger and dragon. \r\n\r\nTo Daoists, the tiger and dragon represented the creative forces of the universe. They are also potent emblems of the balance of power that Daoists believed permeated all existence. Therefore, along with tigers, they are often depicted as the steeds of Daoist deities.",
