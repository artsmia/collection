  "text": "Rude Osolnik, like Bob Stocksdale, was one of the first Americans to make a career of woodturning; his signature tapered candlesticks were widely sold through department stores in the 1950s and 1960s.  Osolnik spent his career in Berea, Kentucky, where he taught and served on the boards of regional organizations such as the Southern Highland Craft Guild for decades. Osolnik embraced a wide range of woods, including worm-eaten specimens such as this one, creating varied surfaces through his experimentation.",
