  "text": "Diana, the ancient Roman goddess of the hunt, has just released an arrow from her bow. The small crescent in her hair refers to her role as moon goddess.\r\n\r\nThe American artist Frederick William MacMonnies studied and worked in Europe, becoming well known both there and in the United States. His naturalistic portrayals of nudes, at times deemed too risqué for American tastes, caused some controversy when publicly exhibited—which only made them more popular. His sculptures were often reproduced in various sizes. This one was made life-size, in the 30-inch size shown here, and also in an 18-inch version.",
