  "text": "At center, Sakyamuni, the historical Buddha, lies in state. Though he is dead, he appears to be sleeping. His disciples and bodhisattvas (future buddhas) are assembled around him, some crying, others screaming, and one even fainting. Just below the scene, animals have gathered to mourn. Hearing that her son was on his deathbed, the Buddha’s mother, Queen Maya (seen at upper right), rushed to his side with two heavenly maidens and a disciple, but she was too late. Every February 15, Buddhist temples hang a scroll such as this one to commemorate the death of the Buddha .",
