  "text": "Phyllis Bramson’s painting sets three artists at work on a sculpture, a painting, and a collage in a mindscape that constantly shifts between abstract space and clear definition. The unstable technicolor environment suggests the inside of the artists’ brains, a mindscape in which many racing thoughts could be channeled into the finished product.",
