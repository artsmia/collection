  "text": "Yee I-Lann is recognized for her experimental technique of splicing together visual references, from history to pop culture, to examine the complex history of imperialism, particularly in her native Southeast Asia. Her portfolio Picturing Power explores how photography was used to lay claim to land and culture through imagery. She places particular emphasis on the Dutch colonial legacy in Malaysia, with images sourced from archives and the artist’s own photographs. The works, with long allegorical titles, suggest a present deeply influenced by a colonial legacy.",
