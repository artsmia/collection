  "text": "Albert Besnard's artistic output was highly varied, ranging from decorative wall murals in public buildings to fashionable portraits and intimate studies. Again and again he returned to the subject of women. He portrayed them in all moods and modes: asleep, dead, giving birth. He would use his wife and friends as models or hire models to pose in his studio, as he did for Study of a Nude Figure.",
