  "text": "<div>\n\t<span class=gmail_signature_prefix>In 19th-century London, toy theaters were printed paper models that could be cut out and assembled by home, a sort of cross between a dollhouse and a puppet show. One could buy the theater itself, then accessories such as sets, cutout figures, and scripts. Offering a consuming form of entertainment, it encouraged children to learn lines, cut out and decorate the figures, and stage performances for family and friends. This is a stage set from a version of <i>The Tales of Baron Munchausen, </i>rollicking tall tales first written by </span>Rudolf Erich Raspe (1736–1794) but added to by many authors for decades after his death. This backdrop is self-referential in that the shop depicted sells toy theaters, one of which hangs on the facade above the windows, plus all the goods to go with them.\n</div>",
