  "text": "This chair is one of a set of twenty-four made for the Salem mansion designed by Samuel McIntire for Elias Hasket Derby, reputed to be America's first millionaire.  Their design, with oval backs incoporating Prince of Wales feathers, derives from the pattern book of George Hepplewhite, <I>The Cabinetmaker and Upholsterer's Guide</I>, first published in London in 1788.  Their overall painted decoration mirrored a fashionable treatment for furniture first popularized in England by Robert Adams and James Wyatt in the 1760s and 1770s.",
