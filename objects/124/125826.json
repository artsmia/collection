  "text": "Iva Gueorguieva was born in Sofia, Bulgaria in 1974. In 1990, after the fall of Bulgarian communist regime, her family immigrated to the United States. Blurring the boundaries between painting and sculpture, Gueorguieva’s painterly compositions juxtapose the hardness of bent steel and the poetics of gestural lines, shapes, and vibrant colors.\r\n\r\nThe energy of her bold palette with chaotic and exuberant compositions suggests shifting moods of anxiety and emotion. Despite the absence of any obvious narratives, her unique style of abstraction evokes tales of beauty and violence.",
