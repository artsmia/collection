  "text": "Ox: 牛\r\nMaki was known for his unique way of making prints. Instead of working with professional carvers and printers, he did everything himself. He carved his designs onto plywood (versus the traditional cherrywood) and then applied cement to parts of the block, sanding or scraping the cement to add extreme texture, including embossing. (Although embossing was used in traditional woodblock printing during the Edo period [1603–1868], Maki’s effects are more pronounced.) After printing with the blocks, he sometimes also applied color by stencil.\r\nIn this print, the red circle and green teardrop are raised, a result of embossing. Maki also used the cement to create the scraped effect visible in the purple area.",
