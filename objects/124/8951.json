  "text": "Some locate the origins of modern-day eggnog in the posset, a hot drink combining milk and wine or beer. This drink bridged alcohol’s distinct uses within curative and celebratory contexts. From the 1400s possets were taken as health aids, and by the 1700s recipes including medicinal waters still flourished. But the gradual incorporation of luxury ingredients such as eggs, sugar, spices, and citrus juice, signaled the posset’s transition from medicinal to refined social realms during this period.",
