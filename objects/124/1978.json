      "description": "<p>They were entranced, and entrancing: celebrants of the Aissawa sect of Sufi Islam on a ritual pilgrimage through the streets of Tangier, in Morocco. Eugène Delacroix saw them in 1832 while traveling with the French ambassador, the Count de Mornay, who was negotiating a treaty of friendship with the sultan of Morocco. The pilgrims were eating glass and biting their own arms, among other acts of self-abuse, to draw attention to their religion. Vividly colored and vigorously brushed, Delacroix’s masterpiece captured the commotion, even though it was painted from memory five years later—a memory not easily forgotten.</p>",

  "text": "Eugène Delacroix was the acknowledged master of the French Romantic school. In 1832, he traveled to North Africa with the French ambassador, Count de Mornay, who was to negotiate a treaty of friendship with the sultan of Morocco. One day in Tangier, the two hid in an attic and through the cracks of a shuttered window witnessed the frenzy of the Aïssaouas, a fanatical Muslim sect. The turmoil of that event is conveyed in this vividly colored and vigorously brushed depiction of the fanatics hurling themselves down the street. Of the pictures resulting from the Moroccan experiences, this remains one of Delacroix's most arresting.\r\n\r\nThis painting once belonged to James J. Hill (1838-1916), the Minnesota railroad magnate whose collection of European paintings forms the basis of the Institute's nineteenth-century holdings.",
