  "text": "This robe is comprised of 100 staggered rectangular panels, each containing an image of the Buddha seated on a lotus pedestal, surrounded by flames. The figures take alternating poses: some sit with hands placed together in their lap in the <i>dhyana mudra</i> (contemplative gesture); others hold an alms bowl. The top and bottom-most rows alternate with panels depicting lotus blossoms.\r\n\r\nThe decorative arrangement of this <i>kashaya</i> is based on the Thousand Buddha theme that flourished in China starting in the 6th century, during the Northern Wei dynasty (386–535), and was popularized in Central Asia between the 7th and 9th centuries.",
