  "text": "Water buffalo were domesticated in China around 4, 000 years ago and ever since have been necessary for farming. A vivid, lifelike impression is achieved by the slanting legs, the chubby body, and the head and eyes turned sideways: it is in a resting but watchful attitude. The naturalistic gesture and posture of the animal stand in contrast to the thin abstract lines decorating the body. The socket on the buffalo’s back indicates that the animal has served as a podium—a post supporting another object would have been inserted into it.",
