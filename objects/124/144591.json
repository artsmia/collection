  "text": "The French artist Joseph Gabriel Tourny worked across media—drawing, painting, printmaking—but distinguished himself in the medium of watercolor. He was interested in the history of art, studying Rembrandt’s prints and Italian art of all periods. He spent considerable time in Rome, copying old masters like Raphael, and medieval and ancient works. This interest is reflected in his “Allegory of Summer, ” portrayed as a pensive young woman in a classically inspired wheat and flower crown Tourny has invented anew. The figure's necklace and earrings also mimic ancient Roman prototypes, but are refreshed in a contemporary manner. The woman, likewise is rooted in Tourny’s own century. It may be a portrait. The sitter’s facial features are individualized, and she resembles a woman featured in at least four of Tourny’s portraits. Portrait or not, she is portrayed as the allegory of summer and presented before a glittering gold mosaic. Each golden tile varies in shape and tone, so that the hundreds of meticulously painted and drawn tesserae have a trompe l’oeil effect.",
