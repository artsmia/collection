  "text": "With crisscrossing lines, Ono depicted rice fields fringed by dwellings and a watch tower under a brooding sky. During the 1920s and 1930s, he made expressionistic prints representing the plight of Japan’s working classes. For his leftist views, Ono was barred from participating in exhibitions but nonetheless won acclaim for his arresting compositions.",
