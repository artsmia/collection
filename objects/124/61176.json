  "text": "The famous Ryōgoku Bridge is captured here on a particular night—the twenty-eighth day of the fifth lunar month. Since 1733, that day has been commemorated with fireworks at Ryōgoku Bridge. The event began as a memorial for victims of a cholera epidemic, and it is still held on the last Saturday in July. Thousands of people would watch the fireworks from restaurants alongside the Sumida River, from the bridge itself, or from rented pleasure boats that allowed passengers to enjoy the cool air of the river. Here the boats are festooned with red lanterns that form tiny points of light on the deep-hued water.",
