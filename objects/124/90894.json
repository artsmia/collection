  "text": "A wide range of feathers are used to create fans, and each type of feather holds a particular kind of power depending on the color or character of the bird it comes from.  The Roadman's fan is made from eagle feathers, as the eagle is the most powerful bird.  Flicker feathers have the power to perform miraculous cures from illness.  Brightly colored feathers are highly sought after, like those from the Scissortail whose pink tint is symbolic of morning and renewal.  Fans are created by trimming the feathers and extending the shafts with dowels to create an appearance of uniformity.  The shafts of individual feathers are often wrapped with beadwork, silver wire, or threadwork, and the handles are decorated with beadwork.",
