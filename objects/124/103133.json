  "text": "This simple domestic scene features representational figures of a man, woman, and dog standing outside the door of a house. Though little is known about the subject, it may be a variation of Castle’s so-called dream house drawings, which he made regularly as visualizations of his longing for a home and family of his own. Castle’s abiding interest in patterns is evident in the prominence of the wooden screen door and its ornate Victorian-style embellishments.",
