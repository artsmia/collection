  "text": "This type of stand was used to support vessels for containing liquid. Because they are often found in tombs, they are believed to have served a ritual purpose, although similar stands may have also been used in a domestic setting. The series of perforations found on around the base are consistent with other found in tombs dating to the Three Kingdoms period. Square perforations such as these are associated with stands produced in Silla.",
