  "text": "Camille Billops used fired earthenware to make new images of Jesus as a Black man. Following traditional imagery of Jesus as a martyr or exemplary sufferer for spiritual enlightenment and to save humanity, she depicted him here with a heart shaped hole in his chest. This detail emphasizes both his humanity and role in Christianity as a savior. To keep Jesus's face open to the personal imagination and beliefs of her viewers, she finished the sculpture with a simple linen cloth where his portrait would be.",
