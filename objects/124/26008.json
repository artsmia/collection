  "text": "These photographs are examples of a stereograph created by Jeremiah Gurney. A stereograph is made up of two images next to each other on a page. Just like humans have two eyes, a stereoscopic camera has two lenses. The camera makes two pictures that look similar, but are taken from slightly different perspectives. Then, the pictures are placed into a stereoscope viewer (see an example displayed in the case), and the image that the eyes see is three-dimensional. This feature made them popular, although they were more expensive to purchase.",
