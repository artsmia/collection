  "text": "The book of Matthew relates the story of a miracle witnessed by three of Jesus’s disciples. They saw him “transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun, and his clothes became as white as the light.” Suddenly the prophets Moses and Elijah appeared and spoke with Jesus. Then, a bright cloud covered them, and a voice from the cloud said, “This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased. Listen to him!” Terrified, the disciples fell to the ground. When it was over, they found that Jesus had returned to normal.\r\n\r\nUsing stippling (lots of dots), Proccaccini portrayed Jesus as a shimmering apparition—a prefiguration of the Resurrection. Much of the image is unclear—messy compared to the crisp contrasts of professionally produced prints—but the accidents perfectly express the mystery of the otherworldly event.",
