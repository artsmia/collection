  "text": "Urban Couch was a graduate of the Minneapolis School of Art and Design (now MCAD) and held numerous teaching positions. In the 1960's, Couch often incorporated large patches of vibrant color into his abstract works. In this work from 1962, he uses large blocks of reds and pinks to convey that which is essential to painting—color and form.",
