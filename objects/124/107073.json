  "text": "La Fin du monde was originally developed as a screenplay by the modernist poet and author Blaise Cendrars, but it was published as a novel when funding for the film project fell through. Conceived as a satire, Cendrars’s story features God in the guise of an American industrialist, who out of sheer boredom orchestrates an apocalyptic war on earth for the amusement of the god Mars. \r\n\r\nFernand Léger, collaborating with his friend Cendrars, contributed a series of witty Cubist-inspired illustrations and other designs for the project. His illustrations were hand colored in gouache with brush and stencils. Léger also designed the book’s experimental typography, which he skillfully merged with his illustrations to reflect the chaotic vigor of modern life. Like Cendrars, Léger was captivated by the creative possibilities of filmmaking and set the tempo and progression of the book’s illustrations to simulate the fast-paced rhythm and dynamic nature of a motion picture.",
