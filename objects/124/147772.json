  "text": "Louis Welden Hawkins began his career as a naturalist painter, known for his somber, earthbound subjects. Around 1890, he was better known as a Symbolist artist who incorporated mysterious and dreamlike motifs into his art. This painting teeters on the edge of these two moments in his career. In an unusual, nearly square format, Hawkins filled his garden scene with clues—a broom, a bucket, a rope, a table and chairs, some blue cloth draped over the branch—but did not provide any answers. Through layered brushwork and a subtle range of colors, Hawkins created a moment that is both specific and timeless, rich with unexplained allegory. The painting’s elusive title further compounds the mystery.",
