  "text": "Like many of the German artists in this exhibition, Paul Flindt (Vlindt) trained as a goldsmith in Nuremberg. He produced three model books in the 1590s aimed at the professional goldsmith trade. Drinking vessels like this tankard were a specialty. Flindt was the most prolific of the Punzenstecher--artists who created ornament prints with a goldsmith's punch instead of an engraver's burin. The result is a design made of tiny dots.",
