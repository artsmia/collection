  "text": "Three butterflies in various colors flutter through darkness. The background is sometimes lined, sometimes not; the butterflies are sometimes fuzzy, sometimes crisp. Through subtle changes in color, Hamaguchi experiments with the overall mood of the print. Even small-scale prints like these could take months to make, especially since he had to make a plate for each of the four colors: black, yellow, red, and blue.",
