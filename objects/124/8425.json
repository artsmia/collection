  "text": "Finnish design was in the vanguard of the aesthetic revolution that erupted in the 1960s. Featuring oversized, boldly colored compositions printed on cotton, these fabrics are an exuberant expression of a new generation of textile designers. Marimekko is the best known producer of this style but many other Finnish artists worked independently, creating powerful graphics for other textile manufacturers.\r\n\r\nMarjatta Metsovaara established her own firm, Metsovaara Oy, in Helsinki in 1954. Although she was trained as a weaver and her early successes were due to her innovative design in this media, she shifted her focus to printed cottons in the 1970s. She designed furnishing fabrics for Tampella, clothing textiles for Finn-Flare and umbrella patterns for Green & Green.",
