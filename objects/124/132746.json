  "text": "A bouquet of roses, chrysanthemum, carnation, lily, and iris emerges from darkness. Tanaka is best associated with rural landscapes, but his still life etchings reveal an interest in capturing different textures within the limitations of the medium. Through the use of crosshatching and stippling, he represents the varying smoothness and form of the flowers. As with many of his works, Tanaka implies the presence of a human by depicting organic materials arranged superficially—in nature, the flowers would bloom in different seasons.",
