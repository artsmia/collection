  "text": "Pedestals can be works of art in their own right. This pair were made by Giacomo Raffaelli, the master of 'micromosaic'. As if the ancient technique of mosaic were not sufficiently complex, Raffaelli made tesserae a fraction of the size of ancient examples, so that hundreds and even thousands could fit within a single square inch. Here he depicts birds, flowers, vases and butterflies, the last a symbol for the soul in ancient art, representing the Greek goddess Psyche. The panels of micromosaic are among the largest continuous compositions that Raffaelli ever attempted.",
