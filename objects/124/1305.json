  "text": "This plate bears the arms of the Newton and Alleyne families. This service, which may have consisted of over two hundred pieces, is among the earliest type of armorial porcelains made for the European market. The Chinese motifs painted on the border suggest that the service is transitional in design, and is not decorated entirely in a European manner, as are many later services.",
