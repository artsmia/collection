  "text": "This work captures a fascination with the effect of violent tension on the body, in this case that of the giant Polyphemus. In love with the nymph Galatea, Polyphemus is preparing to hurl a rock at Galatea’s lover. The terracotta was exhibited at the Louvre as evidence of the high skill achieved by students of French academic art education. The choice of subject is a curious one, since Dumont’s father, also an artist, was crushed to death by one of his own sculptures.",
