  "text": "The distinctive seated pose identifies this figure as Nyoirin Kannon, a wish-fulfilling form of the deity Kannon. One right hand holds a wish-granting jewel near his chest, while another holds a string of prayer beads. Lost to time are a bronze lotus blossom that would have been held in the left hand near his chest and a wheel (symbolizing the Buddha’s teachings) on the tip of his upraised finger. A fifth hand rests on his cheek while the sixth is flat on the ground, bracing him against the earth. To accurately depict this complex deity, the sculptor would have referred to iconographic drawings like those displayed here.",
