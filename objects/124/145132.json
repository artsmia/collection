  "text": "Voulkos brought Asian and Abstract Expressionist qualities to his functional pottery before moving fully into non-functional sculpture. This low bowl displays Voulkos’s control on the wheel while the broad, Japanese-inspired brushstrokes depicting figures show the influence of Bernard Leach and Shoji Hamada. The pair made a stop at the Archie Bray Foundation, in Montana, while Voulkos was a resident potter there in 1952—a tour arranged by Warren and Alix MacKenzie (they visited St. Paul along the way).",
