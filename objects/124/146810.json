  "text": "Théo van Hoytema was a leading Dutch printmaker in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He was especially beloved for his studies of animals and his technical perfection. In 1898, he published a portfolio of six lithographic animal studies, Dierstudies, including Angora Konynen (Angora Rabbits). The composition sets the five white rabbits is stark contrast to the jet black background. The rabbits' fur is largely described by relief rather than by ink. Hoytema was fascinated by Japanese woodcuts, which often use blind relief embossing. He applied the technique to the normally flat technique of lithography. The result is a rich, tactile, yet subtle surface over which the play of light animates the image.",
