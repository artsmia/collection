  "text": "Painter Emmanuel Benner reveled in the world of flawless young women lolling in sylvan landscapes. The larger of these two studies served as the basis for Benner's painting Innocence, which he entered in the Salon of 1884. A contemporary critic noted that the large, beautiful nude figure who saw her reflection in a pool of water was painted with great sincerity. The same writer delighted in the consternation of Salon visitors—especially those on Sundays—who flipped through the guidebook to discover if the figure was Venus, Diana, Eve or some other literary character that might justify the nudity before their eyes.",
