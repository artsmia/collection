  "text": "This is the first in a series of twelve erotic pictures representing the twelve months. A courtesan and a customer are watching a young male prostitute write a poem or letter. The handsome customer holds a pipe from the lacquered smoking set nearby. The courtesan familiarly slips her hand into the man’s sleeve. Near the door, a fine lacquered  sake set and a food tray indicate that this is\r\nan amorous gathering at a high-class brothel. A poem provides further clues to the time and occasion.\r\n<I>The scent of plum blossoms would bring the year’s first smile even to a pair of guardian kings.</I>\r\nPlum trees are the first to bloom in springtime. Guardian kings are fierce celestial protectors of the Buddhist faith, and sculpted versions often flank the entrance to Buddhist temples. In mentioning a pair of guardian kings, the poet likely intended a playfully irreverent reference to the complementary pleasures of the courtesan and the male prostitute.",
