  "text": "Picasso had a complicated relationship with dance. He reveled in the Ballet Russe, which brought him into contact with other artists and gave him entrée into upper class Parisian society. In 1918, he married Olga Kholkhova a dancer in the troupe. Though Picasso sought high society, he could not abide by its regimentation and Olga’s insistence that he behave. As a result they frequently came into conflict.\r\n\r\nTwo Dancers seems full of empathy for the awkwardly powerful male tasked with helping the graceful woman appear as weightless as possible. Picasso employed an exceptionally spare, sensitive line that recalls the painting on Greek vases. His use of this style during the early 1920’s caused this to become labeled as his classical period.",
