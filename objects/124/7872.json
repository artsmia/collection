  "text": "A leading American painter, sculptor, and printmaker, Frank Stella believed that a picture was first an object, not a representation of something else. As a result, he embraced stark geometric abstraction of Minimalism as his primary mode of expression. Form, color, and pattern were the fundamental elements of Stella's work. Commenting on his austere and depersonalized view of art, he once stated, A painting is a flat surface with paint on it, nothing more.",
