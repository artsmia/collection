However, this painting, listed at the hefty price of 2, 500 Yen, was by far the most expensive hanging scroll in the sale because of the premium materials used for it. The scroll would have cost $1, 125, at that time close to the average annual income of $1, 368 in the United States and approximating the price of two new cars. Today, this price roughly equates to $18, 000–$19, 000",
