  "text": "These paintings show two eccentric Chinese Zen priests, both of whom became famous for ignoring Zen restrictions on eating meat. Zhutou, at right, loved to eat boar meat and was known for carrying a boar head around town. His counterpart at left, Xianzi, was known to wander riverbanks eating clams, shrimp, and crayfish. Legend has it that Xianzi gained enlightenment while catching a shrimp, and this is the moment shown here. Despite their disregard for Zen monastic rules, such unruly priests were often held in high regard for following their own paths. \r\n This pair of hanging scrolls is among a small handful of works by the enigmatic painter Yōgetsu, known only by the seals impressed on his works. He is believed to have been a Zen priest living in Kyoto.",
