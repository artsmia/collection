  "text": "Claude-Émile Schuffenecker was a skilled post-impressionist artist, but his achievements have long been overshadowed by suspicions that he had surreptitiously finished canvases left incomplete by Vincent van Gogh and Paul Cézanne or made outright forgeries. He was deeply involved with the art world of his time, notably as a close associate of both Paul Gauguin and Odilon Redon and a major collector.",
