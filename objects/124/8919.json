  "text": "Rockwell Kent, a printmaker and illustrator, was hired by Californian company Vernon Kilns in the late 1930s to make patterns for ceramic wares.  He designed at least 30 images for the 'Our America' series.  Stylistically, Kent-designed ceramics bear resemblance to German Jugendstil or Soviet agit-prop pottery.  \r\n\r\nKent's themes, however, incorporate classic American icons.  This chop plate, or meat platter, celebrates the American family farm, a particularly appropriate theme for dinnerware.",
