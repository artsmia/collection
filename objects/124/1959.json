  "text": "This marble sculpture of a faun leering at a young bacchante, or female follower of the Roman god Bacchus, displays the mid nineteenth century interest in mythological subjects within the context of the rococo revival style.\r\n\r\n<P>Clésinger was trained in Paris.  From 1852 to 1864 he lived and worked in Rome, where he was impressed by the monumental figures carved and painted by the Renaissance artist Michelangelo. Clésinger's figures, especially that of the satyr, indicate the influence of Michelangelo's works in the strongly defined musculature, compressed forms and composition, and the satin-like finish of the marble.",
