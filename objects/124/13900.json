  "text": "Lace was one of the most expensive textiles in 1600s and 1700s Europe. Because of the fine materials and the hours of skilled labor required to make it by hand, lace rivaled jewelry in terms of cost and importance. Different centers of lace specialization emerged throughout Europe over time, and the movement of this precious commodity across national borders was tightly monitored and heavily taxed. Its regulation only fueled the desire of consumers—who often preferred “prohibited” laces—and the greed of smugglers.",
