  "text": "This refined silk embroidery depicts eight scholar-officials in a flowering garden, each dressed in elaborately patterned court robes. Several figures hold hu tablets, ritual objects used in imperial audiences, suggesting a moment just before or after official duty. Others hold blossoms in their hands, a gesture that evokes poetic refinement and a cultivated appreciation of nature. The panel reflects the Confucian ideal of harmonizing public service with personal cultivation. Surrounded by peonies, bamboo, and scholar’s rocks, the figures inhabit a symbolic garden of virtue and aesthetic pleasure. Likely intended for domestic or decorative use, this textile offers a stylized vision of literati life—one that celebrates moral integrity, scholarly elegance, and the enduring bond between nature and human order.",
