When Babson wanted alterations around 1912, he entrusted them to Elmslie and his new partner, William Purcell. The two architects designed furniture for the house, including a tall-case clock, andirons, and this box chair with a small carved B on each side.\r\n\r\n[insert photo of Babson house porch w/chair here - NWAA photo]\r\n\r\n[this label needs to be cut to fit label stand]",
