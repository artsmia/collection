  "text": "Early in his career, André Dunoyer de Segonzac exhibited oils with the now-legendary Cubists. But the independent Segonzac revealed his personal style more fully in his spontaneous etchings and watercolors. Many are rooted in the village of Saint-Tropez in southern France, where Segonzac bought a house overlooking the bay in 1925. Méditerranée is part of a series chronicling the beaches of the Côte d'Azur.",
