  "text": "This serene-looking Luohan, or a disciple of the Buddha, is an example of the uniqueness and individuality that artists of the late Yuan (1271-1368) or early Ming (1368-1644) Dynasties were capable of conveying in their work. Eccentric and reclusive in lifestyle, Luohans signify the meditative, nonmaterial values of Buddhism. Despite being regarded as saintly, enlightened men, they were usually portrayed as humanlike rather than as supernatural entities; we see this in the expressive, dignified appearance of this youthful Luohan.",
