  "text": "Carrier-Belleuse made his Salon debut in 1850, but it was the exhibition of works such as <i>Love and Friendship</i> at the 1857 Salon that gained the sculptor recognition. The allegorical pairing of Love and Friendship first became popular in the 1750s under Madame de Pompadour's patronage, but fell out of fashion by the end of the 18th century. At a time when Rococo themes and styles were once again en vogue, Carrier-Belleuse reintroduced this subject. Love, in the form of Cupid, confides in Friendship, who is accompanied by a dog, a symbol of her fidelity. Further features such as the heart on the dog's collar and doves perched on Love's bow, are symbols traditionally associated with the theme of love.",
