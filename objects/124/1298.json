  "text": "Chinese factories developed a vocabulary of patterns that could be applied to each piece of a dinner service.  The <I>FitzHugh</I> pattern made from 1780-1820s consists of four botanical clusters evenly spaced around a central panel.  The central panel could contain a landscape, monogram, or coat of arms.  <I>FitzHugh</I> decoration is monochromatic, usually in underglaze blue, but appeared in other colors as well, as seen in these platters in green and orange.  Customized for the American market, their center features an eagle holding a ribbon with the national motto <I>E Pluribus Unum</I> in its beak.",
