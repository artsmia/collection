  "text": "Jonathan Howard & Company was one of the earliest weathervane manufacturers in the United States. Using hand-carved wooden molds and casting the entire front of each piece in zinc—not just the head as most other makers did—their factory made some of the most detailed weathervanes of the day. This one was originally covered in gold, but weathering by the elements has exposed the underlying metal.",
