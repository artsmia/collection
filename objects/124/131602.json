  "text": "This is a robe made by the Ainu, the Indigenous people of northern Japan. Called a kaparamip, it is made entirely of trade cotton imported from central and southern Japan. Assembled in an almost patchwork manner, the sleeves are made of striped and taupe cotton, while the body is made of purple and indigo-dyed cotton. The hem and wrist openings are lined with red-dyed cotton appliqué. The overlay consists of white cotton and is embroidered with black cotton thread. All of the decoration shows a fluid, imaginative interpretation of traditional Ainu motifs.",
