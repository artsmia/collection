  "text": "Kalabari men and women of Nigeria occasionally wear a unique cloth called pelete bite (“cut-thread cloth”), which is created by altering fabrics imported from India. Starting with existing striped or checked patterns, new designs are made by cutting parts of the white threads with a razor and removing them. The technique also produces little holes, adding to the visual effect. The women who create pelete bite are important figures in Kalabari society: artists, innovators, and entrepreneurs. Their art transforms imported cloth into a cultural symbol.",
