  "text": "The <I>mezuzah</I> (מזוזה) is a symbolic object meant to serve as a daily reminder of the presence and protection of God. <I>Mezuzot</I> are inscribed pieces of parchment containing certain passages of the Book of Deuteronomy. The piece of parchment is then rolled and placed into some kind of decorative and protective case.\r\nThe word <I>mezuzah</I> actually means “doorpost, ” as the phrase in Deuteronomy 6:9 states, “You shall inscribe them [these words] upon the doorposts of your house and upon your gates.” Subsequently, the scroll and case are affixed to the entrance of a home or synagogue. In addition to the biblical text, the name of God is also inscribed on the back of <I>mezuzot</I>. This particularly name for God, <I>Shaddai</I> (שדי), is said to stand for the phrase “<I>Shomer Daltot Yisrael</I>”, which means “Guardian of the Doors of Israel.” Unlike the Torah scroll, the scroll of the <I>mezuzah</I> is not meant to be regularly opened and read. Instead, it serves at a physical reminder of putting text into practice through daily life.",
