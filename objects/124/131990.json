  "text": "For Arts and Crafts proponents, the countryside represented a simpler time, before the world became so mechanized. Nature, they believed, was a place to heal from the onslaughts of modern urban life. This farm, on Scotland’s Isle of Arran, may evoke this rural ideal. Helen Stevenson studied with woodcut pioneer Frank Morley Fletcher at the Edinburgh College of Art, which he headed from 1908 to 1923.",
