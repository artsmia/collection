  "text": "<p>Saint John the Baptist lived in the wilderness with no comforts, preaching and baptizing neophytes with the water from the river Jordan. His clothes were just a tunic of rough camel hair, but here this garment is represented like a soft fur stole dragging on the floor. The Saint’s body is wrapped in an additional, very elegant floral fabric, and the desert where he lived is transformed into a blossoming lawn. Late Gothic elegance supplanted the rigours of hermitic life in the early 15th century.</p><p>The embroidery style of this work, characterized by use of couched metallic threads combined with silk surface stitches, originated in England in the 11th century and became popular throughout Europe in the medieval period. It was primarily used for religious purposes on copes, chasubles and altar frontals and made in both professional workshops and by nuns in convents. \n\nThis fragment was likely part of an orphery, an embroidered band on an ecclesiastical vestment or hanging.</p>",
