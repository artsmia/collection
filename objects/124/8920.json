  "text": "Similar to the large silver cistern at the end of this corridor, this object was originally made to hold cold water for chilling bottles of wine.  It is decorated with classic winged caraytids and palmettes, as well as Asian-inspired designs of birds and flowers.  The cistern is composed of <I>faience</I>, the French term for tin-glazed earthenware, which was introduced to Europe from the East during the Middle Ages and was produced in France by the late-16th century.  The <I>faience</I> industry thrived during the 17th and 18th centuries in several French cities, such as Strasbourg and Nevers, and provided a less expensive though highly decorative alternative to fine porcelain.",
