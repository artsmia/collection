  "text": "Imperial seals always have a knob carved in the form of a dragon. This example, which belonged to the emperor himself, is carved into a pair of intertwined dragons, their faces directly confronting each other. Between them is a sphere representing the auspicious Chintamani jewel. On the bottom of the seal is a four-character mark that reads <i>yubi zhibao</i> (Treasure of the Imperial Brushwork), suggesting that it was used to sign paintings and works of calligraphy.",
