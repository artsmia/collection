  "text": "The banisters that make up the back of this chair were split in half after they had been turned on a lathe.  The bannisters' flat side faces the front, where they would meet the sitter's back, and rounded side faces the rear.  The manufacturing method was more labor-intensive than simple ladder-back chairs with horizontal back splats, yet less costly than their leather-upholstered or caned contemporaries.  This chair descended in the family of the original owners, and was brought to St. Cloud, Minnesota by the Staples family in the 1850s.",
