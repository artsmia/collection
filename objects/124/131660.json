  "text": "This type of horse trapping would have been used beneath a saddle. The large loop is placed under the horse’s tail while the small loops secure it to the saddle. More elaborate than simpler travel trappings, ornamental examples like this one were used for celebratory processions. The side panels are decorated with a checkerboard pattern, and the center panel features a large crest known as “climbing wisteria, ” or agari fuji, a crest used by the Fujiwara clan. The crest is surrounded by characters that read fumi-uma gomen, or “pardon the passing horse, ” a common apology for any inconvenience caused by the horse.",
