  "text": "This editioned screenprint is among the best known of Todd Norsten’s trompe l’oeil (fool the eye) images of words and messages written with “masking tape.” Rendering this type of picture as a printed image—including the tactile thickness and texture of blue painter’s tape—required dismantling the image into fragmentary components that were then printed separately in perfect registration, or alignment—a demanding and precise undertaking. Countless layers of ink were needed to complete the visual effects. Norsten then added lithographic images of hair, dust, and miscellaneous workshop debris to imitate a scuffed and soiled sheet, which he also tore to be irregular in shape as a sly criticism of the preciousness of so much fine art.",
