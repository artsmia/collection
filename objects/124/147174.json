  "text": "In the Bible, the book of Judges tells the story of a prophecy that a woman would receive the glory for the defeat of Sisera, a powerful Canaanite general opposed to the Israelites. Barak, a Jewish king, led 10, 000 men to defeat Sisera's army, killing every man, except Sisera himself. Sisera slipped away and sought refuge in the tent of a woman named Jael. She covered him with a blanket and gave him milk to drink. He asked her to lie if anyone asked if there was a man in her tent. When he fell asleep, Jael hammered a tent peg into his ear, through his skull, and into the ground, thus becoming the one to defeat Sisera. In this engraving, she holds the peg aloft as she ponders her next move.",
