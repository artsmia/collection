  "text": "Backyard Corner could be Wanda Gág’s manifesto. Besides demonstrating her deep emotional attachment to things and places, it describes the activated space that she felt enveloped objects and connected them. This idea can be seen in the halo of concentric lines around the ax handle and the force-lines (her term) flowing from the buckets. These pulsing, vibrating lines knit these objects—and by extension their user—to the soil. In this way, the print conveys Gág’s personal credo of living close to the earth.",
