  "text": "Stoney Lamar, originally from Louisiana, received a B.S. in woodworking from Appalachian State University in Boone, North Carolina, and continues to work in the Asheville area.  Unlike fellow wood sculptor Robyn Horn, whose piece <I>The Scream<I> is shown in this gallery, Stoney Lamar continues to use the lathe to explore the possibilities of form and texture. He creates movement in his pieces by employing a multi-axis technique whereby he mounts the wood once, uses the lathe as a carving tool, then remounts the piece in a different position on a different axis and carves again, often repeating the process several times with the same piece.  <I>Running Headlong Into Metal</I> is a quirky self-portrait that shows his imaginative melding of wood and steel along with the artist's self-deprecating humor.",
