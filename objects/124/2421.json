  "text": "This cupboard was made to commemorate the marriage of John Eriksen Engesaethe to Brithe Grinde. It would have been a highly prized possession and likely had a prime spot in their parlor. The Norwegian inscription reads John Eriksen, Brithe Sjurs Datter Engesaethe, Aar 1870 (John son of Erik, Brithe daughter of Sjur, Engesaethe, year 1870).\r\n\r\nThe Engesaethe family were friends of Aslak Lie, a Norwegian cabinetmaker who had immigrated to the United States in the mid-1800s. Although not signed, this cupboard, made in Wisconsin, is credited to Lie, who had produced stylistically similar works in Norway.",
