  "text": "This service is a remarkable example of the eclecticism of late 19th century silver and, in particular, the Anglo-Indian movement, with Japan also serving as a creative source for inspiration.\r\n\r\nThe design is described in an 1882 catalogue as “an exquisitely beautiful production, a higher grade of chasing...The design chosen is the Eglantine (a favorite English wildflower). The neck of the coffee and the tops of the Kettle, Coffee, Tea and Sugar are hammered. The rustic designs of the handles and spouts add much to the attractiveness of the set.”",
