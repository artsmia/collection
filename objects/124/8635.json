  "text": "This handscroll depicts scenes associated with each of the twelve months. The first scene, shown on the right, shows a pair of traveling entertainers who go door to door at New Years. Their lively dance to the accompaniment of the <I>tsutsumi</I>, a small drum held on the shoulder, was filled with exaggerated gestures and light hearted puns, to the great amusement of the townspeople. Their occasional exclamations of Mansai! Mansai! (Long Life! Long Life!) were felicitous wishes for a healthy and prosperous year. \r\n<P>The second scene, represents the Hatsuuma Festival, held on the first day of the horse in the second lunar cycle. On that day, people visited Shinto shrines in order to offer prayers to Uka-no-mitama, the deity of grain, in hopes of ensuring a successful planting season.",
