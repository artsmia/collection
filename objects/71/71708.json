  "text": "Alongside the advancement of their scientific study, shells, in 18th-century France, became an important design element in architecture, painting, furniture, and decorative arts. Shell motifs abounded, and they revealed a richness of color and shape, including bizarre coils, and fancy crenellated edges. This selection from a suite of sixty colored plates features shells in an entirely imaginary setting. Hanging from the branches of a bizarre plant that springs from a big sea snail, or blossoming from a coral tree, Jacques Charton’s shells epitomize the playfulness and visual pleasure of the Rococo period.",
