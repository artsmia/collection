  "text": "This small statue of an unidentified lama was probably made by his devotees after his death. The monk sits firm in the meditating posture with his heavy outer robes articulated in opulent folds. Such portraits are typically hieratic and idealized and the face of this one appears rather summarily rendered. While the facial features are not particularly expressive of the monk's personality, the energetic treatment of the robes does impart a sense of grandeur to the solemn figure.\u000bWithout positive identification by inscription, it is impossible to assign a specific date to this image. In general, however, it seems to relate most to dated bronzes of the thirteenth century.",
