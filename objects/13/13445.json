  "text": "Wang Fengjiang from Jiaxing in Zhejiang province specialized in making metal handwarmers and footwarmers during the late sixteenth century. Wang successfully sought out high-level literati patronage, allowing him to produce some of the finest late Ming metalwork. This large warmer is formed of copper beaten thin and light, with perfect symmetry. The exquisite piercework domed lid was probably inspired by brocaded textile patterns. The swing handle is finely inlaid with silver wire incorporating in seal script the name of the maker. Handwarmers were especially useful to calligraphers and painters when working in cold conditions, and large versions such as this were also used as footwarmers.",
