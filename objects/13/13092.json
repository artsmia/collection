  "text": "Perhaps Eva Zeisel's best-known design is her \"Town and Country\" line for Minnesota's Red Wing Pottery.  It was spurred by a suggestion from Hubert Haddon Varney, the company's president, in the mid-1940s  to create something \"Greenich Villagey,\" meaning something slightly bohemian that would appeal to younger, more casual-living consumers in post-World War II America.  Zeisel's forms are characterized by the undulating curves that animate each piece, an organic quality being explored by painters and sculptors of the period such as Isamu Noguchi and Jean Arp.  \"Town and Country\" was produced from 1947 until the early 1950s.",
