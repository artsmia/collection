  "text": "Shi sou, \"Old Man Rock,\" one of the most famous names in late Ming metalwork, is thought to be the art name of a monk who specialized in fine desk objects and Buddhist figural works. His sculpture is finely cast and worked in bronze with details chased and inlaid with silver wire. This piece bears a silver-inlaid maker's mark on the back that reads: Shi sou.\r\n<BR>\r\n<P>Bodhidarma or <I>Da mo</I> was an Indian Buddhist missionary who reached China in 526. He is considered the first of the Six Patriarchs of the Buddhist religion. His miraculous crossing of the Yangzi river on a reed, the theme depicted in this fine table-top statue, was a popular subject in Buddhist painting and sculpture.\r\n",
