  "text": "Fang Yuan-huan from Shantung province passed the provincial (second-level) examinations in 1534. This exuberant and somewhat wild <I>hsing-tsao</I> (running grass) inscription quotes from a neo-Confucian, neo-Taoist commentary by the Sung philosopher Chu Hsi (1130-1200) and Chu's friend, L端 Tsu-ch'ien (1151-1181), on the practical application of moral values. It reads:\r\n\r\n<P><I>Master Hui-an (Chu Hsi) said that a man must keep kindness and gentility as his principle; bravery and firmness should not be lacking from his virtues, but must only be applied when appropriate. Master L端 (L端 Tsu-ch'ien) asked why if a scholar-official were learned and knowledgeable, he still could not use his Tao to educate and influence (people) far and near? It must be because he is unable to touch the solid ground (i.e., his knowledge is too theoretical to be practical).</I>",
