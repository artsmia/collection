  "text": "While influenced by Chinese models, Vietnamese potters made their own innovations and added new elements to their designs. The domed lid of this bowl, for instance, has a scalloped rim that probably imitates the edge of a lotus leaf. The spontaneously brushed underglaze floral decor is executed with an iron rich compound. This type of covered bowl was popular during the 13th and 14th centuries.",
