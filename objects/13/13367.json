  "text": "This type of folding reclining armchair, while extremely rare (only three hardwood examples are recorded), is referred to in the Ming encyclopedia <I>San-tsai t'u-hui</I> as a \"drunken lord's chair.\" With its attached headrest, slanted back and elongated arms, the chair is obviously designed for casual lounging and, unlike most Chinese armchairs, it encourages a relaxed posture. The solid frame caned seat is hinged at the front, enabling it to fold forward thus allowing the chair to be collapsed into a flat form for storage or transportation. When such chairs are depicted in paintings, they are usually shown being used by scholars in their studios or out-of-doors in casual settings.",
