  "text": "Kurt Seligmann is often associated with the French Surrealists, whose works were recognized for their fantastic, dreamlike imagery. Seligmann exhibited with this group throughout the 1930s before emigrating to New York in 1939.  With personal interests as diverse as alchemy, magic, and gardening, Seligmann filled his canvases with biomorphic and organic forms.  Deliberately ambiguous in its subject matter, Slow Motion is from a later period in the artist's career when he was involved in costume and stage design for ballet and modern dance performances.",
