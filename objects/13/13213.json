  "text": "<i>Rimon</i> is Hebrew for pomegranate, a fruit that grows in Israel and other parts of the Middle East and is often eaten on the Jewish New Year.  The pomegranate is said to have 613 seeds, the number of commandments found in the Torah. This pair of rimmonim (plural) echo the rounded pomegranate shape while the complex filligree wire provide an organic motif.  The staves on which the Torah is rolled are often referred to as <i>Etz Hayim</i> or the \"Tree of Life,\" so the rimmonim are thought to represent the fruit of that tree.\r\n\r\n",
