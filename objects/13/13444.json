  "text": "Commemorative stupas (Tibet: chorten) are the oldest symbols of Buddhism.  Their dome-shaped form replicates the architectural structure of a stupa--a burial mound that originally was erected to inter the remains of the Buddha. A worshipper would have commissioned a chorten as an act of merit, and it also would have been a devotional object.  Chortens frequently contain holy relics such as sacred scriptures and ashes of holy people.",
