  "text": "The rugged mountains, forests, and waters of the Lake District in the northwestern corner of England attracted artists and poets of the Romantic movement. In 1797, J. M. W. Turner visited the area and filled many sketchbook pages with pencil drawings of the terrain. In subsequent years, he made larger watercolors, such as this one, based on his on-site sketches. Here he gives us a northward view of River Derwent in the Borrowdale Valley. Beyond Longthwaite Bridge, two low but prominent hills—Castle Crag to the left and Grange Fell to the right—narrow the valley, creating “The Jaws of Borrowdale.” Turner’s sketch of the bridge survives at Tate Britain museum in London, and its battered condition attests to Turner’s repeated reference to it for the production of watercolors.\r\n\r\nConservation of this watercolor was made possible by a generous contribution from the Blackman-Helseth Foundation.",
