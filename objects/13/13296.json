  "text": "The pierced metal design of figures among buildings on the lid of this document box suggest that is was commissioned as a wedding gift. The gift-bearing visitors arriving at a mansion probably represent a betrothal ceremony.  \r\n\r\nThe rather unusual \"white brass\" lacquer (pai-t'ung), an alloy of copper zinc and nickel often referred to as paktong, is used for the pierced metal lid design, hinges, latch, and corner mounts. The silver alloy of the pictorial elements is finely engraved and inset flush with the black lacquer, creating a design of bold contrast. The interior of the box is treated with red lacquer decorated with a gold band of scrolling foliage d√©cor.",
