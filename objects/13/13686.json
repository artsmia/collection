  "text": "Ceramic cosmetic boxes were popular during Song (960-1279), and numerous examples have survived in Qingbai as well as a variety of celadon glazes. This one is decorated on its lid with an incised lotus blossom. The interior reveals three small containers in the form of open flowers linked by appliqué tendrils. There is a faint hint of iron brown accenting each of the containers. While the plasticity of Jingdezhen porcelain allowed Qingbai potters to create rather complex forms, their ceramics were always utilitarian in purpose, as is the case with this container for powdered cosmetics.",
