  "text": "This cloisonne teapot is inlaid with delicate brass wire to create an intricate design against a green enamel body. Each side of the pot is decorated with a dragon that dances and soars across an ornate inlaid cloud pattern. Interestingly, while the bodies of the dragons are rendered in very typical forms, the heads and claws are so abstract they are nearly unrecognizable. The lid is also decorated with a dragon, its face trapezoidal, resembling a flat mask. The abstract nature of the design indicates the dragon is being used as a decorative, artistic design rather than a religious symbol. Indeed, the teapot would have been used on an everyday basis by a wealthy Chinese family rather than for ritual or ceremonial purposes.",
