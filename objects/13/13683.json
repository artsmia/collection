  "text": "This small, hemispherical-shaped ewer would have likely been used for tea. Its lid is mold-made with a chrysanthemum motif. The vessel body is segmented and decorated with a floral scroll executed in thread-like relief decoration. This type of decoration first appeared in Southern Song (1127-1279) Qingbai and continued into the Yuan dynasty (1280-1368). Small and delicate, this type of porcelain tableware was appreciated by China's middle and upper classes throughout the Song and Yuan dynasties, and this form of vessel may have been equally appreciated abroad as well, perhaps in Southeast Asia or the Middle East.",
