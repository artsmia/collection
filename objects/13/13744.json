  "description": "Altar cloth of handmade linen containing several techniques. The open squares of cut and drawn threads are first button-holed with green silks and drawn threads are then whipped with green silks. These are embroidered with various themes with white thread in similar techniques as Lacis-work with women's heads and winged bodies, winged animals fronting each other and birds. This specimen has also its drawn threads at each edge terminated to a pointed lace edge, at both ends, while a tiny buttonholed and fringed stitch runs about the whole piece.",
