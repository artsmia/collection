  "description": "Border - drawn-work - of fine linen lined with a coarser one. Some of it has a very fine quilting stitch, with drawn and open work stitch. The technique has a certain similarity to the wee-known Tristan and Iseult work. This fragment must have been part of a larger piece, and has its present outer edge cut in scallops.",
