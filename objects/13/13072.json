  "text": "Although in her formal training Susan Rothenberg studied sculpture, she is known primarily for her large canvases featuring the simple outlines of animal or human forms.  Among the artists affiliated with the New Image painting movement of the mid 1970s, she favored nontraditional figurative imagery which emphasized form rather than content. A rare example of Rothenberg's editioned multiples, Head and Foot are typical representations of the isolated body fragments most often seen in her paintings. They were cast at the Art Foundry near her home in Santa Fe, New Mexico in 1991.",
