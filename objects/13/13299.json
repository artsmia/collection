The central, as yet unidentified figure, has inlaid silver eyes and sits cross-legged in a meditative posture on a lion throne, flanked by a pair of seated and standing Jinas. The other 19 Jinas wear simple garments and have inlaid silver auspicious marks on their chests  srivatsa. Portable plaques of this type were usually commissioned by the Jain laity and presented to their temples.
