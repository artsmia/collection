  "text": "This pair of dragons are in a sinuous S-shape, with scaly bodies and tendrils curved in one direction, indicating the dragons are flying in the wind. At the mouth of each dragon is a circle, symbolizing a jewel. Dragons began to be frequently depicted chasing auspicious jewels (known as Chintamani) after the introduction of Buddhist art to China. We donâ€™t know exactly where this pair of dragons came from, but they seem to have served as a part of a larger sculpture. The liveliness of the form reflects the cosmopolitan culture of the Tang dynasty, which absorbed many influences beyond China.",
