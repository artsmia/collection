  "text": "Originally mounted as cheek pieces on a horse's bridle, these graceful harness trappings are each cast in the form of a mythical phoenix holding a pearl in its beak. The Liao people came from the northern steppe grasslands to conquer north China in the tenth century (916-1125). They were horse-riding herdsmen who lavished great attention on the saddles and harness trappings of their prized mounts. Although foreign rulers, the Liao embraced many aspects of China's artistic legacy and sponsored the production of ceramics, bronze accoutrements, and exceptionally fine gold work. Many examples of gilt metal harness trappings have been excavated from Liao tombs where horses were occasionally interred with their masters.",
