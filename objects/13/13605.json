  "text": "This pipe bowl was made for the market. No Two Horns lived during an important time in Plains Indian history and participated in important events (see the tipi in the center of this gallery). He used traditional methods to create works sold to visiting tourists. \r\n\tHe carved an image of a mounted warrior that wraps around the entire surface of the object. The photograph shows he achieved naturalistic proportions of the figures when he created this work. Even more impressive is that No Two Horns had only one functional hand, so he had to hold this work between his knees as he carved.",
