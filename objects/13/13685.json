  "text": "This dish represents a category of white Cizhou ware wherein the main motifs, usually peonies or lotuses, are set off with parallel striations created with a comb-like instrument. The floral designs are incised with a sure hand in a much freer and looser style than encountered in earlier Cizhou designs. Wall paintings in a Jin dynasty (1115-1234) tomb at Licunkou, Changzhi  in Shanxi province support the stylistic evidence for Jin period dating.",
