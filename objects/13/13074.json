  "text": "Beginning his career as one of many postwar minimalist painters, Frank Stella's early work was dominated by geometry. His use of flat colors and tight, linear compositions established him as a major figure in the field of hard-edged painting. Stella's work eventually evolved into abstract figuration, experimenting with curvilinear asymmetry and biomorphic shapes and lines. More recently, Stella has become interested in architecture, which has influenced his work in sculpture. Gattenom reflects this shift, exploring the illusionistic possibilities of three-dimensional space. Retaining the nonobjective aesthetic for which he is best known, he has introduced a new dynamic complexity to his work.",
