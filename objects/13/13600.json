  "text": "The Chinese porcelain industry began to collapse in the early 1600s. In response, Japanese potters started creating porcelain wares, decorated in the Chinese manner, for the European market. By the 1660s and ’70s, however, Japanese-style shapes and designs, like leaves and folding fans, became popular among both foreign and domestic buyers. Tea masters of the time prized elegant plates such as these for use in kaiseki, meals served in conjunction with a tea gathering.",
