  "text": "This intricate stone screen (jali) allowed for air and light to circulate within architectural spaces. The spotted red sandstone from the Delhi-Agra region had been a popular medium for architecture and sculpture for centuries, and the Mughals, the dynasty that ruled much of India from the early 1500s through the mid-1800s, used it frequently. This jali blends geometric and floral decoration. The two floral roundels in the upper corners are carved on one side with the word “Allah.” While these screens served a practical purpose by allowing in light and air, the idea of divine light, which was intrinsic to Islamic theology, provided an added metaphorical dimension.",
