  "text": "This intricate stone screen (<I>jali</I>) allowed for air and light to circulate within architectural spaces. The spotted red sandstone from the Delhi-Agra region had been a popular medium for architecture and sculpture for centuries, and the Mughals, the dynasty that ruled much of India from the early 1500s through the mid-1800s, used it frequently. This <I>jali</I> blends geometric and floral decoration. The two floral roundels in the upper corners are carved on one side with the word “Allah.” While these screens served a practical purpose by allowing in light and air, the idea of divine light, which was intrinsic to Islamic theology, provided an added metaphorical dimension.",
