  "text": "The Salado lived in a relatively small area of west-central Arizona.  This area formed the crossroads of three cultural traditions: the Ancient Puebloan, Mogollon and Hohokam.  According to recent research, the Salado may not represent a separate culture but a variation in the customs of one of the three local cultures.  Salado pottery is unique and easily identifiable.  The design on this bowl includes a break in the boldly painted, black line just below the interior rim, which is a common element in Salado pottery.",
