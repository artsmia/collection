  "text": "The early Burmese Buddhist religious texts called <I>Kammawa-sa</I> date from the Pagan period (1044-1287). Originally, they were either incised with a stylus or written in ink on plain unadorned palm leaf. By the late 17th century, however, a square type of Pali writing executed in thick, glossy black lacquer called \"tamarind seed\" became popular. Heavily  folded lacquered cloth, often embelished with silver or gold-leaf decoration, was preferred for the production of sacred texts such as sutras and books of ritual practice. The pages of <I>Kammawa-sa</I> of the 19th century are protected by lacquered wooden covers with beveled edges. They are decorated overall with panels of lively free-hand gold leaf decorations.",
