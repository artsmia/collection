  "text": "A vajra hammer (skt. vajramudgara, Tbt. dorjey towa) symbolizes the relentless effectiveness of critical wisdom to smash ignorance and illusion. The hammer is often shown being carried by numerous deities and dharma protectors in Buddhist sculpture and painting, and it is used by the priesthood in esoteric rituals. It is employed, for instance, in the purification ceremony that preceeds a kalachaka initiation.",
