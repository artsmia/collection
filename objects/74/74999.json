  "text": "This pioneering illustration of the northern hemisphere, with the terrestrial and celestial globes shown together, provides an interesting snapshot of Dutch attitudes towards exploration (and colonization). The Japanese island of Urup, for instance, which is just below the elbow of Bootes, the club-wielding herdsman shown wearing a pink coat, is labeled Compagnies Lant. This is Dutch for Company Land and references how the Dutch East India Company had taken possession of the island after a 1643 expedition there. The costuming of the constellation Bootes is also noteworthy. Shown as a heroic nude in Dürer's woodcut, Bootes is depicted here in northern attire, wearing a fur hat, long coat, and warm boots.",
