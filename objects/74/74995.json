  "text": "Nishikawa Sukenobu, a print artist and book illustrator, was fascinated by the fashions and behaviors of women of different social classes, a curiosity that his readers also shared. In this book, Sukenobu offers a view into the daily lives of women alongside portraits of historically famous women.\r\nHere, two copies of the same book look different because one is plain and the other handpainted. Once purchased, owners could treat the books however they desired, including coloring in illustrations.",
