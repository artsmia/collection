  "text": "Woodward and Tegg's seven-volume Caricature Magazine treated a variety of themes, exemplified by the small reproductions shown here. Everything was fair game: the Irish, taxes, boxing, city life, country life, religion, marriage. Playful distortions, humorous expressions, and absurd premises-singing cats, a maggot race-cleverly lampooned each subject to great comic effect.",
