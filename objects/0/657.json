  "text": "This embroidered wall hanging was most likely commissioned to commemorate the very type of family ritual scene it depicts. In the center is shown an aristocratic couple in semiformal court dress seated in an outdoor setting amongst clouds, peonies and chrysanthemums. In what is likely a coming-of-age ceremony for their son, the seated parents are attended by dignitaries and invited guests, one of which hold a pair of ritual wine vessels called chueh for use in the upcoming ceremony. Important occasions like weddings, anniversaries, birthdays and coming-of-age rituals often were commemorated with pictorial embroideries such as this.",
