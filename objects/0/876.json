  "text": "The <I>ding</I> food cauldron was the most prominent type of ritual vessel in China’s Bronze Age. It was among the first cast vessels, and the earliest example was unearthed from the Erlitou culture (c. 2000–1600 BCE) site. <I>Ding</I> were used to cook meat during a ceremony devoted to ancestral spirits. The vertical handles allowed the vessel to be placed over a fire. There were many variations of the <I>ding</I>. This example with squared body is known as <I>fang-ding</I>, or squared <I>ding</I>. The dominant <I>taotie</I> animal-mask motif appears on each face of the vessel, divided by flanges on four corners.",
