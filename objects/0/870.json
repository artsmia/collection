  "text": "This is a typically shaped <I>you</I> vessel with an oval cross section, but the exaggerated high collar of the lid, topped by a spherical knob, gives it an impression of height. The decoration, divided into three bands at the foot, neck, and lid, displays dragons with S-shaped bodies, turned heads, and large S-shaped crests or horns. The neck belt is divided into two panels by a three-dimensional animal’s head and the foot and lid belts by very shallow lines in low relief representing flanges. The handle ends in animals’ heads with bottle-shaped horns.",
