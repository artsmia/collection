  "text": "As they became more daring embroiderers began to actually cut holes in cloth and create free form images from a single interlocking, looped thread. By the end of the 16th century needle workers realized they could dispense with cloth altogether and simply use an individual thread to create a very specialized fabric which today we call needle lace.",
