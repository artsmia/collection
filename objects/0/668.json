  "text": "This meticulously woven thanka illustrates a Tibetan legend about the lama Hua Shang, the seventeenth arhat of the Tibetan pantheon. Having offended the emperor, he was forced to flee China. Several years later the next emperor allowed him to return. When he arrived by sea, other arhats, or holy men, gathered to welcome him and ensure his safe reentry. Hua Shang is shown returning in his boat in the lower right corner, while Shakyamuni Buddha, seated on a lotus pedestal, dominates the center top of the thanka. The extremely fine detail in this handwoven thanka reflects the patience and discipline required for monastic life. Although professional artisans wove thankas, many were also produced by priests, who considered such creativity a pious act.",
