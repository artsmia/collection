  "text": "This thangka, a vertical hanging scroll, is meticulously woven to illustrate a Tibetan legend. Having offended the emperor, Lama (teacher) Hua Shang, an arhat (holy man) of the Tibetan pantheon, was forced to flee China. Several years later, the next emperor allowed him to return. When Hua Shang arrived by sea, other arhats gathered to welcome him and ensure his safe reentry. He is shown returning in his boat in the lower- right corner, while Shakyamuni Buddha, seated on a lotus pedestal, dominates the center top of the image. The extremely fine detail in this handwoven thangka reflects a high degree of patronage, as well as a patience and discipline accordant to the pious act of its creation.",
