  "text": "A winged rod with two snakes twined around it is an ancient emblem of messengers. Originating in Middle Eastern cultures such as Babylonia (in present-day Iraq), it became an attribute of Hermes, the Greek god of commerce and communication, and of Hermes’ Roman counterpart, Mercury. In Roman myth, Mercury threw his staff at two snakes fighting on the ground, which then ceased fighting and became affixed to the staff.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe caduceus is often mistaken for the staff of Asclepius, the ancient Greek god of medicine and healing. Asclepius’ staff has a single twining snake and lacks wings. Although the caduceus has been used internationally as a symbol of the medical profession, only the staff of Asclepius is technically correct.",
