  "text": "Artists used a wide variety of materials in ancient Egypt, depending on availability, price, and who was having the piece made. Materials ranged from bronze and clay to more expensive substances, such as gold, silver, and wood. (Due to its desert climate, Egypt had—and has—very few trees.) This stone amulet of the sacred falcon of Horus would have been quite common had it not been for the semi-precious stone inlays that form the eyes. Semi-precious stones, such as deep blue lapis lazuli and black obsidian, were largely reserved for pieces made for the upper classes.",
