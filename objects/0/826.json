  "text": "Although it has the general shape of a small <I>yong</I> bell, this instrument lacks the ring suspension device of the <I>yong</I> as well as the 36 bosses found on most late Zhou bells. And if it were suspended, the composite-animal <I>taotie</I> mask on the body would be upside down. Known as zheng, this type of bell was not used in graduated sets but rather individually, and was held in an upright position. The incised bird and volute, triangular, and running spiral patterns are similar to those found on painted lacquers of the same era, and were prevalent in southern China during the Spring and Autumn (c. 770–476 BCE) and Warring States (c. 475–221 BCE) periods.",
