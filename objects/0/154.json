  "text": "The deities Khorlo Demchog (Sanskrit: Chakrasamvara) and his consort, Dorje Pakmo (Vajravarahi), at the center of this cosmic diagram are shown in sexual embrace, symbolizing the union of compassion (Khorlo Demchog) and wisdom (Dorje Pakmo). Devotional practices focused on them are a means to overcoming attachment, desire, and ignorance of the true nature of reality, which is the emptiness of all phenomena. The surrounding circle contains cosmic buddhas, dancing dakinis (demigoddesses), and the historic Buddha, Shakyamuni, while the upper and lower registers contain protective and lineage teachers.",
