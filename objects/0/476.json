  "text": "The rich, skillful embroidery on this dalmatic, or outer vestment worn by a Catholic deacon during Mass and other services, is characteristic of 16th-century Spanish liturgical wear. Its two roundels featuring Saint John the Baptist-as a child with the Madonna (seen here) and as an adult-would have connected the congregation with the celebrant who wore it. The presence of the saint on both sides suggests that it was made for a church that fostered a particular devotion to him.",
