  "text": "This Renaissance portrait is exceptional for its psychological force. In the mid-1500s, Giovanni Battista Moroni was northern Italy’s leading portraitist, admired for the intense naturalism and remarkable immediacy of his work. A clever illusion here is the book projecting over the marble ledge, as if into the viewer’s space. The unidentified sitter’s biretta (square cap), book, and black garment, and also the austere setting, indicate he belongs to the clergy, an important class of clientele for the artist.\r\n\r\nThe painting is in superb condition. Even the dark pigments, which often fade over time, are well preserved—evident in the details of the man’s black cloak and hat.",
