  "text": "This tapestry is one of a set of eight tapestries which depict the stories of Queen Artemisia. These tapestries were modeled after Catherine de'Medici who ruled France during the mid 16th century. During her rule France was embroiled in religious and economic turmoil. In an effort to demonstrate her own devotion to her husband and her ability to rule successfully, Catherine de'Medici adopted Queen Artemisia as her alter-ego, and in the late 16th century a set of tapestries were made to illustrate the story. \r\n\r\nThe tapestries in this gallery remind the viewer of the queen's wisdom and competence as she makes sure her son, the future king, is educated in academic disciplines as well as military training.",
