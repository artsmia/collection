  "text": "This small plate with impressed design at first glance appears to be a typical example of so-called \"northern celadon\" produced at the Huangluo kiln complex at Dongchuan, Yaozhou county, Shanxi province. Close examination, however, shows a design in the caveto comprised of young boys playing with dogs in a lush, garden-like setting complete with Taihu rocks. This very rare motif of children and dogs has only one recorded counterpart; a bowl of similar size in Osaka, Japan.",
