  "text": "Women played numerous roles in ancient Egyptian spiritual beliefs. Many held immense power and were revered alongside their male counterparts. Among the many ancient Egyptian goddesses were Anuket, who ruled over the River Nile; Hathor, who symbolized both war and love; and Isis, who represented motherhood, fertility, and protection. Sekhmet, depicted here with the head of a lioness and the body of a woman, was known as the goddess of war and the protector of the throne.",
