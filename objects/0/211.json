  "text": "This exceptionally rare bowl exemplifies the late Tang production of brown painted wares at the Huangbaozhen kilns at Yaozhou in Shanxi province. This region would gain lasting fame for the production of \"northern celadon\" during the Song (960-1279) and Jin (1115-1234) dynasties. The intriguing interior cluster of quatrefoil motifs seen here, probably representing abstract plant forms, appear on pottery shards excavated at the Huangbaozhen site. The painting technique developed during Tang at this important ceramic center provides a northern precedent for the popular brown and white slip decorated wares of the Cizhou kilns which flourished during Song and Yuan dynasties (1280-1368).",
