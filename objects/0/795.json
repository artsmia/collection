  "text": "Throughout his career, Aristide Maillol drew inspiration from the female form. His Three Nymphs recall the Three Graces of Greek mythology - personifications of grace, charm, and beauty. He also followed classical precedent by showing the three figures clasping hands and dancing. \r\n\r\nMaillol rejected the roughly textured surfaces favored by such earlier sculptors as Rodin for the smoothly swelling forms of ancient Greek sculpture. Maillol's massive figures convey a classical serenity and repose, which also contrasted with the vigorous intensity and drama of Rodin's or Degas' sculptures. The three women here all share the same sturdy form, yet each has slight facial and physical differences.",
