  "text": "Holidays is painted in coarse strokes of brilliant color. The landscape and figures are simplified within the patchwork of various hues, producing a patterned or decorative effect. The energetic, almost festive atmosphere is achieved through the use of rich texture, mosaic-like brushwork, and bold colors. A member of the artists' group the Eight, Maurice Prendergast regularly depicted ordinary people at leisure in the public spaces of modern life.",
