  "description": "Mortuary figures, pair of, representing warriors both wear armor, with curious head-dresses, and one carries a sword-like object. Four of these figures were found at the entrance of a tomb in Honan province. Two bought by M.I.A., and two by the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. They are fashioned of polychromed pottery of the greyish cast associated with Wei. Traces of faded terra cotta color remain. These are unusually large tomb figures.",

  "text": "These guardian figures exhibit the classic elements of the mature Northern Wei style (386-584) including a rigid frontal pose, elongated torso and emphasis on lineal drapery patterns. The facial features are less stylized, however. With active and intent expressions, the heads turn, in contrast to the stiff flat bodies. These figures were unearthed along with two others at the entrance of a Northern Wei tomb in Southern Henan province. The four figures were likely placed against a wall where they functioned as guardians at the tomb door.",
