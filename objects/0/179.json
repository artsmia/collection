  "text": "Quilts such as this Rose of Sharon pattern with a fruit and bird border were often made to celebrate special occasions such as a wedding and were given as a gift or were part of a dowry. In general, they did not serve as an everyday bed cover but were displayed on holidays and for other celebrations.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that this quilt was made in upstate New York as that is where the donor's grandfather served as a Presbyterian minister.",
