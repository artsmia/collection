  "text": "This set of ten figurines was excavated intact in 1948 from an imperial tomb at Anjiakou in Henan province, near Luoyang, the site of the “eastern capital” during the Tang dynasty. The retinue comprises five pairs of figures: <I>lokapalas</I>, guardian warriors of Indian Buddhist origin often shown (as here) standing on bulls; earth deities, composite creatures with feline bodies, grotesque heads, flaring wings, and flamelike crests; civil officials; camels; and two exceptionally fine horses. The drip-glaze decoration was applied by a traditional Tang technique called <I>sancai</I> (three color). The retinue is remarkable for its large size, fine modeling, lavish use of rare blue glaze, and the fact that it is apparently one of only two complete excavated tomb sets in Western collections.",
