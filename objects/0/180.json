  "text": "Allan Houser was one of the foremost American sculptors of his generation. He originally worked as a painter before turning to sculpture in the last few decades of his life. His creations are known for their smooth, flowing, organic lines and depictions of Native American life. Houser portrayed women frequently in his work. This sculpture is a classic example. It depicts a young Native woman, shawl clasped around her and fringed bag in hand, setting off to meet someone. The figure is upright and graceful, with movement implied in the gentle flow of her dress.",
