  "text": "Originating in the Hongshan culture of the Neolithic period, around 4000 to 3000 BCE, the <i>bi</i> disk is emblematic of heaven. The <i>bi</i> disks from the later Han dynasty tend to be more elaborate. The outer band of this <i>bi</i> is decorated with openwork designs of four dragons. Dragons were believed to have the power to control heaven, suggested here by the dragons fully surrounding the disk. \r\n\r\nThe raised bosses toward the center of this <i>bi</i> (known as <i>guwen</i> or “grain pattern”) are simpler in comparison to earlier Western Han examples, which were accompanied by incised spirals signifying sprouting grain—perhaps a symbol of fertility. By the late Han dynasty, the curving tails of the grains became less obvious or disappeared completely, as seen here.",
