  "text": "<p>Eliakim Smith was one of the most skilled cabinetmakers in the rural Connecticut River Valley of western Massachusetts.  A variety of furniture forms, including chests-on-chests, desks-and-bookcases, and high chests of drawers were made by Smith or those that worked in his shop.  The objects have histories in Hadley, Northampton, and other towns around Springfield, Massachusetts.  \n</p><p>While it is unknown where Smith trained, he adopted the more urban Boston traditions of craftsmanship, as seen here in the stylized flame finials and molded drawer sides.</p>",
