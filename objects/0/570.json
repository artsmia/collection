  "text": "Possibly carved as a flower vase, this vessel is in the form of an upright finger citron also known as a Buddha's hand. Patterned leaves entwine the citron, and a second, miniature citron is carved in relief at the base of the container. A work such as this would have been admired for its auspicious subject matter and somewhat rare yellow color.",
