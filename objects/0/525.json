  "text": "Symbolic of good wishes, the <I>ju-i</I> (literally \"as you wish\") is a sceptre-like object first encountered in Buddhist art. By virtue of its auspicious name, it became a favorite motif in the decorative arts of the Ch'ing period (1644-1912). Placed on a writing desk or held in the hand, <I>ju-i</I> sceptres were made from a variety of materials including jade, carved lacquer, wood, cloisonné and porcelain. This spectacular gold and jade sceptre, decorated with the eight precious symbols of Buddhism, is from the imperial collection.",
