  "text": "Some embroiderers begin with an openwork ground fabric, choosing a filet or knotted cloth as a base for their embroidery and using a darning stitch to create intricate patterns. (Some textile historians speculate that this type of ground cloth was inspired by contemporary fish nets.) Although not restricted to one use, embroidery in this style was frequently used to create decorative bed hangings.",
