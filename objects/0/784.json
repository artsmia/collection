  "text": "Dominating this scene is the Colossus of Rhodes, one of the Seven Wonders of the ancient world. He watches as the widowed Greek queen, Artemisia, in the central boat, directs the capture of the city. The principle that a queen as well as a king could not only protect a kingdom but also initiate military actions was a concept that was useful to reinforce the personal power of several regent queens of France during the 16th and 17th centuries.\r\n\r\nThe reference to important historic personages or events incorporated into tapestry images frequently gives power by association to the people who own these large, impressive hangings.",
