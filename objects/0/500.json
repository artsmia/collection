  "text": "This exceptionally fine bowl shows a courtly scene. An enthroned personage in the central medallion is accompanied by two attendants; ten smaller figures surround the medallion, and the next tier is a row of sixteen even smaller figures. Kufic script decorates the outside of the rim. Minai is the name for this type of overglaze-painted ware. The human, animal, arabesque, and calligraphic themes of minai ware were often comparable to the subjects that miniaturists painted for texts, and several examples directly relate to the stories in illustrated books. The museum owns an outstanding group of minai bowls, including an example of the less common variant with designs executed on a turquoise ground.",
