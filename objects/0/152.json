  "text": "This robust half-round table is an early example of a rare form. Huang-hua-li half-moon tables do not seem to have been made in great numbers and only a few Ming examples have survived. It is assumed that these tables were originally made in pairs to be placed together to make a circular table or separated and placed against a wall.\r\n\r\n<P>The sixteenth-century carpenter's manual, <I>Lu-pan Ching</I>, clearly sets out the construction criteria for such tables including the half-width back legs seen here that would form a whole when placed together with their mate. The solid construction of this table with its generous use of timber, supporting cross-stretchers, thick cusped aprons, and archaic style feet (called double-hoof feet) suggest that it is one of the earlier examples of half-round tables to survive.",
