  "text": "Thomas Chambers was born in England in 1815 and moved to America in 1832. From 1852 to 1857 he was known to be living in the Hudson River Valley and painting the local landscape. It is most likely that View of West Point dated from this period. Recent conservation of this picture was made possible by a generous contribution from an anonymous patron through the Adopt-a-Painting program.",
