  "text": "Thomas Chambers most likely painted this vibrant view of West Point military academy when living in the Hudson River valley, in New York. The bold, colorful patterns in the trees, cliff face, and flowers, and some inconsistencies in scale, display the originality of his self-taught style. Artistic devices like the hillside view, broken trees in the foreground, and river curving into the hazy distance reveal his knowledge of landscapes painted by professional artists in the region.\r\n\r\nConservation of this picture was made possible by a generous contribution from Al and Dena Naylor through the Art Champions program.",
