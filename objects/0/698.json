  "text": "Moche leaders subjected their prisoners of war to public humiliation, torture, and often sacrifice. Typically in Moche art, captured enemies are shown in the nude. But the artist who created this vessel chose to emphasize the prisoner’s high status by depicting him in full regalia. In addition to his stoic expression, the figure’s headdress, nose ornament, ear spools and patterned tunic illuminate his status—and reinforce the significance of his defeat.",
