  "text": "Probably intended for wine, this ovoid bottle is covered with a nearly black glaze into which a decorative scheme was incised and carved before firing. The dark glaze design elements appear against the light grey ground of the exposed body clay. Commonly known as the \"cut-glaze\" technique, this decoration was most likely inspired by the partially glazed brown and white ceramics produced during the Tang dynasty (ninth century) at the Huangbu kilns.\r\nThe technique was fully developed at a number of Cizhou type kilns during the early Northern Song (960-1127) and it rose to prominence during the Jin period (1115-1234). This particularly fine example with precisely carved floral patterns was made in the Huairen kilns in northern Shanxi province.",
