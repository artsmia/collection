  "text": "A wide projecting rim, the edge of which is engraved with a thunder pattern, separates the body of this short, three-footed incense burner from the three-tiered, high cover. The surface of the burner is carved with relief floral designs, <I>shou</I> (character for longevity), and a bat, representing good fortune and happiness. The two lower sections of the cover are embellished with similar floral patterns and a serpentine dragon forms the finial while the perforated lid allows for the burning of rare incense. This vessel is recorded as having been in the imperial collection. It was purchased in China following the collapse of the Qing dynasty in 1912.",
