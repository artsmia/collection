  "text": "Se-‘e-he Ki, or Elder Brother’s House is the name of these basket designs. Se-‘e-he was the hero in many old stories of the Akimel O’othom. At first he was held in great esteem, but later he lost his popularity and became a vagabond, often being pursued by his enemies after voyaging into the village from his home in the mountains. He would retreat, but the trails were so confusing that his enemies could never follow him. Carefully tracing the basket’s maze design will lead to his home in the center without crossing any lines.",
