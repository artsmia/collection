  "text": "Probably the finest embroidery in all of India came from the Kutch region of Gujarat, where minute stitching and mirror work was a specialty of several Muslim groups.  The veil here contains more than 9, 000 tiny mirrors, designed to deflect the harmful intent of the evil eye.  A wealthy Muslim woman would have worn this kind of veil and tunic only on special occasions, completing the ensemble with a pair of loosely fitting silk trousers (<I>ejar</I>) with embroidered cuffs.",
