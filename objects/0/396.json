  "description": "Buddha, bronze seated figure in attitude of contemplation, also known as the Mudra, or position of 'calling the earth to witness'. The green bronze pedestal is in two tiers; the upper one shows lotus leaves in relief beneath a beaded rim, and the lower, (broken at right side) with ovoid indentations, some of them perforated. The ears are weighted but unadorned. The hair is short, in spiky curls and the usnisa had indentation to hold flame, which is missing. The eyes are enameled, proving the figure to be a late piece.",

  "text": "Seated on a lotus throne with hands in the bhumisparsamudra (\"calling the earth to witness\" gesture), this Buddha image combines characteristics of northern and central Thailand schools of sculpture. The cushion-like pedestal and pose are typical of early figures from the northern kingdom of Lan Na while the stylized facial features typify the later Sukhothai style.",
