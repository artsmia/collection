  "text": "A combination of four masks appears on this bronze finial, which originally adorned the end of a pole. A forceful <I>taotie</I> (composite animal) mask with downward-facing C-shaped horns appears on one side of the top. This monster’s face forms a mask on a human head; it has the broad nose typical of early masks. On the other side, a ram’s head, with horns turned down, bites on a head resembling a <I>taotie</I>. This remarkable work demonstrates that men wore zoomorphic masks in ritual ceremony.",
