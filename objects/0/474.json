  "text": "Lucy Percy (1599–1660) was one of the best known ladies at the court of King Charles I of England.  She was a celebrated wit and had a penchant for political intrigue and scandal. In 1617 she married the notorious rake, James Hay, Earl of Carlisle, without her father's consent. She quickly involved herself in court circles, eventually becoming an intimate friend of Queen Henrietta Maria. After the death of her husband, she shifted her loyalty to the Republican party and was able to give its leaders important information concerning the royal family. Upon the restoration of Charles II, she conveniently switched her affections back to the Royalists, and tried to regain her position at court. But before she could make any marked progress in this direction, she died. \r\n\r\nConservation of this picture was made possible by a generous contribution from Al and Dena Naylor through the Art Champions program.",
