  "text": "This model illustrates in three dimensions both the complexity of Wright's design and its complete engagement with the site. (Wright always favored a building into a hill rather than on top of it.) The main approach to the Francis W. Little house was on the inland side. The hallway on view in this gallery was situated on the Lake Minnetonka side.  An adjoining hallway with small square windows connected it to the master bedroom on the far right end of the house.  At the opposite end was the large living and music room pavilion (now at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York).",
