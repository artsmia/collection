  "text": "Born in Anhui province, Zhu Chang lived mostly in neighboring Xin'an. While there, he studied with Hongren(1616-1663), the central figure of the Anhui or Xin'an school of painting. It was from that renowned master that Zhu learned the basics of his own technique and style. Zhu is also said to have studied and copied works by various Yuan dynasty masters which accounts for the extreme degree of simplification and literati values apparent in his sparse landscape paintings.\r\n\r\n<P>This scroll features the rectilinear and multi-faceted cliffs and elongated spreading pines characteristic of the famous Huangshan mountains of Anhui province. The linear, rather spare style capturing the fissured forms and surfaces of the rocks and trees, owes a great deal to Hongren and the solitary nature of Zhu's own personality.\r\n\r\n<P>The inscription reads:\r\n\r\n<P><I>During the first lunar month of the year 1668, painted at leisure in the Bamboo Hill Inn on the River Gau by Zhu Chang, called Shanshi.</I>",
