  "text": "This chest, probably made by foreign craftsmen working in England, is an example of cross-cultural design influence. The woods used for the decoration are all native to England, but the complex patterning of buildings in fantasy perspective originated in the German city of Cologne in the late 1500s. At that time, craftsmen from around Cologne settled in Southwark, across the Thames River from London, to avoid the restrictions placed on foreigners by the city guilds.\r\n\r\nThese craftsmen specialized in marquetry—designs made of different woods cut from thin sheets (veneers) and then fitted together and glued to furniture as decoration. Organizing this work in a way previously unknown in England, they made veneered panels in standard sizes and produced ornamental strips by the foot, to be used as needed.",
