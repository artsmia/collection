  "description": "The tang is formed of the crested bird's head inlaid with turquoise. The socket, into which a jade blade has been fitted, is also inlaid with turquoise. A circular depression in the middle section of the tang suggests that it may also have once had inlay. Pieces of turquoise are missing in both tang and socket. The jade blade is dark, grayed-green mottled with cream and red toward the point on one side. The reverse is mottled with cream and red the length of the blade. Patina green",
