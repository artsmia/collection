  "text": "Used for holding wine and sometimes water, this piece represents a category of vessels in which a typical pottery shape has been translated into bronze. New technology accommodated precise decorative schemes—thinner vessel walls and more structurally sound knobs, handles, and pendant rings—than was possible in pottery. As bronze artisans continued to perfect their craft, vessels became increasingly elaborate, intricately cast, and varied in form.",
