  "text": "This chair demonstrates the gradual evolution from the Baroque William and Mary, Dutch-influenced style favored during their reign in England from 1689-1702, to the lighter, curvilinear Queen Anne style, which dominated American design from about the 1720s to 1750s.\r\n\r\nTraditional \"Boston chairs\" have some degree of lathe-turned decoration and leather upholstery affixed with exposed metal tacks.  Later versions such as this one have \"crooked\" or \"spooned\" backs, offering greater comfort to the sitter.  The stiles on either side of the back panel are molded (carved) rather than turned, and come together into a continuous line with the crest rail at the top, another later characteristic. \r\n",
