The camel was the primary beast of burden along the great caravan routes which linked Tang China with Central Asia and the Middle East. This surly beast, as well as the various foreign peoples which thronged the great markets of Ch'ang-an and Lo-yang, became favorite and exotic subjects for the observant Tang potters.",
