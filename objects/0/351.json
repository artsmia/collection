  "text": "The dedication of large numbers of votive statues in the temples of Cyprus began in the 7th century B.C. Such sculptures, symbols of one's devotion to the gods, represented the constant presence of the worshiper in the temple. This votary, one of many unearthed at the temple of Golgoi, was made during the archaic period, which lasted from the late 6th to early 5th century B.C. Common characteristics of archaic Greek sculpture, as shown in this figure, include the faint smile commonly referred to as an Archaic smile, almond-shaped eyes, and stiff, static pose.",
