Founded in 1795 to promote the “mechanic arts” and their application to the betterment of American society, the organization counted tailors, hatters, metalsmiths, housebuilders, and others among its members. Paul Revere, the famous patriot and silversmith, was its first president. Wells, a bookbinder, served as the association’s secretary.",
