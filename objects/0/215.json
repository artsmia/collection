  "text": "The long-handled censor is an important symbol of authority, held by high-ranking priests as they lead other monks through the temple to the main worship hall. In Buddhist ritual, the burning of incense before a holy image is one of six devotions considered to be effective in accruing religious merit. The diffusion of fragrant smoke symbolizes the permeation of Buddhism throughout the universe.",
