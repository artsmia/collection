  "text": "This preparatory drawing for Bracquemond’s print The Storm Cloud, or Geese in a Storm (Mia P.1,821) announces his ambition to etch a sky as magnificent as the one in Rembrandt’s The Three Trees (Mia P.1,307). A comparison of this drawing with the eleventh version, or “state,” of The Storm Cloud shows how far his penchant for experimenting could take him.",
