  "text": "King Charles I of England (1600–1649) commissioned Rubens to paint a ceiling mural for Whitehall Palace in London. This is an oil sketch for the portion of the mural celebrating the power of his family’s monarchy and the reign of James I, Charles’s deceased father. In this painting the child represents King Charles when he was still a prince. He is presented as the embodiment of the union of England and Scotland. Three women crown him: the woman in red personifies England; the woman in yellow represents Scotland; and the third is Minerva, goddess of wisdom and war. Above them two cherubs hold the coat-of-arms of the United Kingdom.",
