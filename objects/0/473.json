  "text": "Lewis Warrington entered the U.S. Navy as a midshipman in 1800 and steadily rose in rank. For his heroism in the War of 1812, Congress awarded him a medal. The hairstyle he sports in this portrait was the fashion of the day. After the French Revolution, men in Europe and America cast aside their long powdered wigs in favor of cropped face-framing locks, emulating the haircuts of ancient Roman statesmen.\r\n\r\nConservation of this picture was made possible by a generous contribution from an anonymous patron through the Art Champions program.",
