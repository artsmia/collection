  "text": "Lamaist (Tibetan Buddhist) dancers wore colorful robes like this one when performing at religious festivals held at monasteries. The robe is actually an import from China. Initially a Chinese court robe, it was altered in Tibet, where the addition of large triangular panels and striped cuffs dramatically refashioned the original, tapered sleeves. Court robes with a dragon embroidered on the neck/chest were popular with Himalayan Buddhists. The Qing dynasty (1636â€“1912) court presented many dragon-festooned robes, along with other tribute silks, to monasteries in both China and Tibet.",
