  "text": "This Chinese gown, initially a chaofu court robe, was altered in Tibet for use in ritual Lamaist dances. Large triangular panels and striped cuffs were added to the original tapered sleeves. Court robes with this type of dragon yoke were popular with Himalayan Buddhists, and the Qing dynasty court presented many of them, along with other tribute silks, to monasteries in both China and Tibet. Dancers wore these colorful robes when performing for the public at religious festivals held at the monasteries. Such festivals provided most of the communal entertainment in Himalayan settlements and were important forums for public communication, the expression of religious beliefs, and social identification.",
