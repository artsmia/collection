  "text": "This painting is a copy of one of Gilbert Stuart's best-known portraits of George Washington, which was finished in 1800 and formerly owned by the New York Public Library. Sully made many copies of Stuart's portraits of President Washington for government buildings and historical societies because Stuart could not meet the astonishing demand for them.\r\n\r\nIn this portrait, Washington's right hand rests on a copy of the Constitution. The sword alludes to his military heroism.",
