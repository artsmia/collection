  "text": "Mia's painting is a copy of one of Gilbert Stuart's best-known portraits of George Washington, which was finished in 1800 and formerly owned by the New York Public Library. Sully made many copies of Stuart's portraits of President Washington for government buildings and historical societies because Stuart could not meet the astonishing demand for them.\r\n\r\nThis portrait of America’s first president borrows heavily from the conventions of European royal portraiture, which were designed to glorify a ruler’s authority and sophistication. Set amid majestic columns and billowing drapery, Washington assumes an elegant pose and steely gaze. But instead of the fancy dress and jewels of a monarch, he wears a sober black jacket and knickers. Still, some symbols of power remain. The sword at the hip signifies military rank and strength, the table leg, formed by fasces (bundle of wooden rods), is a symbol of unity, and the double-headed eagle, an emblem of power and empire. His desk, with books, papers, and pen, reference his learning and enlightened principles. Yet the most venerated ideal of the young republic, that all men are created equal, was beyond the reach of most of Washington’s constituents. \r\nIn this portrait, Washington's right hand rests on a copy of the Constitution. The sword alludes to his military heroism.",
