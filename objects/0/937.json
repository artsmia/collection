  "text": "A bronze spear head fastened to a long pole would have served as a weapon in hand-to-hand combat. This example, composed of a jade blade and a bronze hilt, was far more rare and would only have had a ceremonial function. The jade spear has a central ridge creating a beveled surface resembling a real spear blade. The surface of the bronze hilt is cast with <I>taotie</I> animal masks inset with green stones. Among the findings at the Shang capital, Anyang, bronze spear heads were common, whereas spears made of bronze and jade, like this one, were rare.",
