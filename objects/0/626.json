  "text": "Baskets became important to the O'odham (Papago/Pima) economy with the introduction of the railway and tourist market in the 1880s. New forms and designs emerged to accommodate Euro-American taste. Basket makers experimented with representational designs including, human figures, dogs and butterflies. Market demand for smaller, more portable items created a new style: the miniature basket. Incredibly difficult to produce, they showcase the weavers' skill.",
