  "text": "The inscription suggests that, by aligning oneself with nature, a person could expect to live a quiet life of peace and tranquility, a sought-after goal during the political and social chaos of the early seventeenth century. It reads, in part:\r\n\r\nSurrounded by ten-thousand miles of water is\r\nwhite cloud village, amidst the flowers is\r\nbuilt a grass hut;\r\nEvening lotus are reflected in clear pools,\r\nlike-minded friends face one another on verandas…\r\nI have a spirit that soars beyond this mundane world,\r\nYou possess the prescription for immortality.\r\nThe river-side mountains are green without end,\r\nand often seem to float in an endless expanse.\r\n\r\nOn a summer day in the year 1614, I entrusted (my ideas) to the brush at the Northern Suburb Mountain Cottage. —Bian Wenyu",
