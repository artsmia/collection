  "text": "By the beginning of the 19th century both England and France had made significant advances in the art of printing on cotton fabrics. Designs that incorporated important, well-known architectural buildings or monuments were quite popular. Because the buyer of these home furnishing prints was likely to live with the purchase for quite some time, they seemed to prefer patterns that suggested not that they were in style, but that they have never been out of style.\r\nThis particular image of French monuments centers on the Place Vendôme, surrounded by four other monuments, including Notre Dame and the Madeleine.",
