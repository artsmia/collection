  "text": "With its shallow oval shape and quatrefoil outline, this tenth century ceramic brushwasher is likely based on a silver vessel. The upright sides are molded in high relief with precious objects flanked by stylized florets with classic scroll borders around the rim and base. The decoration has been picked out in bright green while the background is glazed in amber brown, two of the most common glaze colors in Liao dynasty (907-1125) ceramics.\r\n<P>A pair of octafoil brushwashers with the same colors as this vessel and similar moulded d√©cor was excavated in 1977 from a Liao dynasty tomb in Wengniute County, Inner Mongolia.",
