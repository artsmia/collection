  "text": "The Southern Song dynasty was a period of relative peace, which allowed a refined and introspective atmosphere to permeate court taste. This is reflected in the tranquil shapes and muted glazes of such classic Southern Song wares as southern celadon, Guan, and Ge wares. Of those Song ceramics given court patronage, however, few are as admirable and popular as the celadon ware produced at the Longquan kilns, typified by their simple, well-proportioned forms and their thick, lustrous, blue-green glaze that approximates polished jade in its brilliance. The double-fish motif seen here is a traditional Chinese symbol of marital happiness.",
