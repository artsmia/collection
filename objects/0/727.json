In 1817, two years after this portrait was painted, Reid designed the present pattern of the American flag of stars and bars, with thirteen stripes representing the original American colonies and a new star being added each time a new state is admitted to the Union. The flag depicted in this portrait shows a style of American flag with white stripes on the outer edges, one of the unconventional versions of the flag which preceded Reid's standardization.",
