  "text": "On December 1, 1783, a crowd estimated at 400,000 people gathered to watch inventor Jacques Charles and engineer Nicolas-Louis Robert fly their hydrogen balloon. This painting records their historic flight from the Tuileries Gardens in Paris to the village of Nesles-la-Vallée, 36 kilometers away, the longest crewed balloon flight at the time, traveled in just over two hours. Benjamin Franklin was among the attendees, having come to Paris to sign the peace treaty with Great Britain that ended the revolutionary war and recognized American independence\r\n\r\nAcross the River Seine, horse and carriages make their way down the Champs-Élysées and around the Place Louis XV, where Edme Bouchardon's bronze equestrian statue of King Louis XV (reign 1715-74) can be seen. The sculpture was destroyed in 1792 during the French Revolution, and the plaza, renamed the Place de la Revolution, was the site of the public executions by guillotine during the Reign of Terror. It is now known as the Place de la Concorde.",
