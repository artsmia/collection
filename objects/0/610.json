  "text": "This impressive garment displays a scattered scheme of gold <I>shou</I> medallions (representing long life) and multicolored flowering narcissus bulbs against a blue satin ground. Datable to the Guanxu period (1875-1908), it displays prominent <I>shou</I> medallions in a style that was popular in the private court of the Empress Dowager Cixi. This gown reportedly belonged to her personally. The fragrant narcissus is a beloved flower of the New Year and a harbinger of spring. This flower originated in Europe, but was known in China by the Tang dynasty (618-906) having been imported through the Middle East along the Silk Road.",
