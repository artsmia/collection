  "text": "Cut from a single, cypress tree trunk, this gnarled naturaliste form served as either footstool or low table.  Created by the Minneapolis interior designer, John Scott Bradstreet, it is but one piece in a total ensemble designed for the Duluth real-estate businessman, William Prindle and his wife, Mina, for their home designed in 1904 and completed in 1906.  Combining elements of Japonisme, Art Nouveau and American Arts and Crafts, Bradstreet adapted a Japanese technique (<I>jin-di-sugi</I>) of artificially aging cypress wood.  Other furnishings designed for the home's interior are on view in the Prindle Living Room on this floor.",
