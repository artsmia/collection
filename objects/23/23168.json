  "text": "Isadora Duncan was an American modern dancer and choreographer who toured with Loie Fuller (whose inventive signature dance, reinterpreted in the form of a sculptural lamp, can be seen in this gallery). Both Duncan and Fuller are considered founders of modern dance. The lighting in this photograph highlights the dancers’ bare skin and flowing garments to create texture and drama, a method Steichen used as one of the first modern fashion photographers. Duncan’s unique dance style emphasized freedom of the body and a move away from the rigidity of ballet. She was inspired by the art and dress of classical Greece, performing barefoot and with draping, flowing costumes to allow for natural movement.",
