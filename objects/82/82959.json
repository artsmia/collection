  "text": "The origins of the deity Zhenwu (perfected warrior) go back to the Warring States (3rd century BCE) and Han dynasty (206 BCE to 220 CE) periods. At that time, he was known as Xuanwu (the dark warrior) and was simply represented by a tortoise entwined by a snake, representing the guardian of the North. This mold-made image, produced in the Cizhou kilns of north China, would have been used on an altar table for personal devotion. Zhenwu is shown wearing formal court attire with a flying dragon on the chest. He sits in a dignified posture befitting his status as a celestial emperor of the dark heavens, the dark warrior tortoise at his feet and the sleeves of his robe decorated with images of the Big Dipper.",
