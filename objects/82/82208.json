  "text": "A renowned scholar-painter in 19th century Japan, Yamamoto Baiitsu used the difficult boneless technique of applying pigment directly to the paper, without outlines, as a way to impart a palpable delicacy to leaves and petals. As demonstrated in these screens, he also was skilled at capturing nature's complicated profusion of vegetation. Unlike his predecessors, who had little firsthand knowledge of Chinese painting styles, Baiitsu had direct access to Ming dynasty bird-and-flower paintings, imported through the port at Nagasaki. Here, he acknowledged his debt to China by rendering the garden rocks in their blue-green manner.",
