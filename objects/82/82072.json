  "text": "This colorful and detailed painting illustrates the Hiyoshi Sannō Shrine festival held in mid-April. Shintō deities associated with the shrine are believed to protect nearby Mt. Hiei, shown here in the third panel from the left. During the festival, participants carry seven consecrated mikoshi (portable shrines) to from the shrine to Sakamoto, on the shores of nearby Lake Biwa, where they load them and sacred shrine horses into waiting skiffs. A boat race ensues to the far side of the lake. This screen shows the race in progress, with four of the sumptuously lacquered mikoshi with bell-shaped roofs visible in the boats. Colorfully dressed participants row the boats and beat drums while a crowd of people cheer them on from the shore.",
