  "text": "The character tiger appears to morph into a tiger itself in this work. Instead of using a colored ink, Morita developed a technique in which he first wrote with an aluminum flake pigment mixed with PVA glue onto smooth black paper and then coated the written surface with lacquer. Morita was a proponent of “calligraphy without characters,” reducing writing to abstract forms that defy legibility. During the 1950s and 1960s, Morita actively communicated with European abstract artists and American abstract expressionists, acting as a bridge to promote calligraphic arts.\r\nIn East Asia, tigers are considered auspicious and are one of the twelve zodiacs.\r\n虎\r\nTiger",
