  "text": "The Yoruba have numerous deities, called orisa. One of them is Sango, the god of thunder and lightning, also associated with social justice and spiritual well-being. Yet Sango has two sides, positive and negative: the rainfall that nourishes the earth is frequently accompanied by destructive storms. The Yoruba concept of life is indeed one of a dynamic balance between opposite forces. Most orisa have specific followers, led by a priest. Sango priests go into a trance when possessed by the thunder god, resulting in energetic dancing to the beat of drums. The countless shells and bells on this purple dyed costume would have added to the sensorial intensity of the performance.",
