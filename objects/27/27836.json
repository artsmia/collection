They could have been already completed by her husband William Sumner, a registered plateworker, before he died.  In any case, women in the Sumner family were very involved with the operations of the firm.  Shortly after Mary registered her mark as a widow, she formally entered into partnership with her daughter, Elizabeth Sumner, one of the few women known to enter the trade formally before marriage.",
