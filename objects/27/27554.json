  "text": "The Ceiba tree holds a sacred place in Maya tradition and beliefs. It symbolizes the 'World Tree' which sits at the center of creation: its roots sink deep into the underworld, its trunk occupies the earth realm, and its branches reach up to support the celestial vault.\r\n\tIn San Pedro Sacatepéquez the Ceiba tree refers to the regeneration of human and plant life. It is a common motif used on cofradía textiles, where it serves as a reminder of the importance of renewing customs and traditions through community rituals.",
