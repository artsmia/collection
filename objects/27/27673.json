  "text": "Official court hats are either formal (ch'ao-kuan) or semi-formal (chi-kuan) and of a summer or winter variety. The latter was a close fitting cap of quilted crown and upturned brim often faced with fur or velvet. The type of fur, as well as the insignia spike on top (gilt metal) connoted rank and were carefully regulated. This hat is surmounted with a plain gilt \"jewel\" indicative of a seventh rank official. The peacock feather (ling-chih) was a distinction awarded by the throne for meritorious service.",
