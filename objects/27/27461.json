  "text": "We all make aesthetic statements daily by the clothing we wear, but often other information is encoded into our costume choices. The traditional clothing worn in many parts of Guatemala reflects ethnic as well as geographical preferences for color and design. Within these parameters, however, each weaver has considerable room for individual expression.\u000bRed tube skirts with minimal striping patterns are preferred by the Quiché women living in the towns of Nebaj and Chajul. These colorful skirts complement the bold pattern preferences incorporated into belts, headbands and blouses, as can be seen in this picture and the objects from Quiché displayed in the adjoining case.",
