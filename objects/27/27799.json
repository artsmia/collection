  "text": "The comfortably angled back and low seat of this chair makes it one of the less rigid seating designs of the 18th century - an ideal chair for lolling, relaxed reclining.  An excellent example of the Federal style in Massachusetts, a similar example is thought to have been at Mount Vernon in Vermont, hence it often being referred to as a \"Martha Washington\" chair.  Outstanding features of the style exhibited by this piece include the maple and ebony decorative inset panels and the feeling of lightness created by the sharply raked back legs, tapered front legs, and graceful curved arms.",
