  "text": "Seymour Lipton made metal sculptures that appear abstract but always had a reference point in storytelling or the natural world. His titles often provide clues. Visionary suggests someone who can see or imagines a future, either through their ability to look ahead past convention or by supernatural means. The dome-like structure at the top of the sculpture implies a skull or head, and the pipe-like form might suggest a telescope or an eye. Might this represent a guardian or an oracle? Lipton's interest in ancient sculpture and its role in sacred sites was always on his mind as he made modern forms.",
