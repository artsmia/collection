  "text": "For Jeffrey Thomas, the act of weaving leaves of corn into a braid is a symbol of the Indigenous teaching that all living things are interconnected. In this work, corn appears in the three central images, which were taken at the farm of Thomas’s step-grandfather, Bert General. The image on the far left was taken in 1949 by Canadian anthropologist Marius Barbeau, who traveled from Ottawa to the Six Nations of the Grand River to buy corn where Thomas’s family lived. The final image is of a baby in a cradleboard photographed by Edward S. Curtis–a white photographer best known for staged photographic portraits of Native people in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Thomas’s reclamation of Curtis’s photographs of Native peoples is central to his practice; in doing so, he centers representation within Native relations and enacts his own visual sovereignty.",
