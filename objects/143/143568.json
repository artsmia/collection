  "text": "In general, there is often scant surviving evidence for most textile artisans of the eighteenth century. One important exception, however, is Anna Maria Garthwaite, a designer who was based in London’s fashionable weaving district, Spitalfields. Unlike many women artists of the eighteenth century, Garthwaite was both highly regarded in her lifetime and remains well known today by modern historians who study historic dress and textiles. While Garthwaite’s skills are evident in the lush botanical silk fabrics and paper designs attributed to her in museum collections worldwide, relatively little is known about her education and training. Just how she rose through the ranks of an otherwise male dominated industry remains somewhat of a mystery.",
