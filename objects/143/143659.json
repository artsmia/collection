  "text": "According to the artist, Hulleah J. Tsinhnahjinnie, “This triptych was a response to the Indian Arts and Crafts Act (IACA) of 1990, which prohibits misrepresentation in the marketing of Indian art and craft products.  IACA makes it illegal to ‘offer or display for sale, or sell, any art or craft product in a manner that falsely suggests it is Indian produced, an Indian product, or the product of a particular Indian or Indian tribe or Indian arts and crafts organization, resident within the United States.’  First-time violators can face civil or criminal penalties up  to $250, 000 or a five-year prison term, or both. Unfortunately, the IACA does not take into consideration the complicated history of being ‘Indian.’ The  triptych asks, who is the real ‘Indian’? Are we to look at  blood quantum and other colonial measures to decide?”",
