  "text": "Working as a writer and journalist in California, Grant Wallace began to feel in about 1919 that he was being contacted by spirits of the dead and extraterrestrials. He had been interested in the occult but had never felt he was a channeler. Yet the messages came and he began writing them down and drawing the messages in trance states. Two of the results are shown here -- gorgeously mysterious transmissions from the otherworldly. Part of the mystery is that Wallace had no prior experience with making art. Did the spirits guide his hand? Only Wallace knew for sure.",
