  "text": "This scene shows the artist’s imaginative recreation of an important moment in his life. When he was three months old, his birth mother turned him over to the care of her aunt, Lillian Rembert, who holds out her hands to receive the child. She raised Winfred as her own child. The artist based this scene on stories told in his family and brought his keen eye for character building and narrative to bear on an emotionally charged moment.",
