  "text": "The Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C., pays tribute to the 58, 220 service members of the U.S. armed forces killed or missing in action during the American war in Vietnam (1954–75). The memorial, sometimes called The Wall, is a popular destination for American tourists who wish to honor those who died for their country. Few Americans, however, are aware of the enormous human cost of the war on the Vietnamese people. Officials of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam have estimated that 1.1 million North Vietnamese and Viet Cong fighters, and some 250, 000 South Vietnamese soldiers, died in combat. In addition to military casualties, more than 2 million civilians perished during the war. \r\n\r\nNguyen’s austere stacked-paper installation is a visual metaphor venerating those Vietnamese who died, while affirming the intrinsic value of all human life. The installation invites reflection and appeals to reconciliation by highlighting the countries’ relative scale of loss. One stack—bearing the number 58, 220— symbolizes the number of Americans soldiers who died during the war, while 59 stacks approximate the total number of Vietnamese who lost their lives.",
