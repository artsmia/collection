  "text": "The story of Samson and the Lion is briefly told in the Book of Judges: \r\n\r\nSamson went down to Timnah together with his father and mother. As they approached the vineyards of Timnah, suddenly a young lion came roaring toward him. The Spirit of the Lord came powerfully upon him so that he tore the lion apart with his bare hands as he might have torn a young goat.\r\n\r\nIn the Abrahamic religions, the tale offers a lesson in the power that accrues to the faithful when visited by the Spirit of the Lord. That lesson combined with heroic drama made Samson and the Lion an ideal subject for Albrecht Dürer to display his pathbreaking graphic talent.",
