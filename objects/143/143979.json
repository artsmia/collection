  "text": "Shōki, the powerful demon slayer (a figure from Chinese mythology), was a frequent motif in Japan, especially during Boy’s Day, a holiday celebrating the health and happiness of boys. Kawanabe Kyōsui, who played a pioneering role in carving out space for female artists, depicted him here holding up a bag with two captured demons. Kawanabe Kyōsui was the daughter of Kawanabe Kyōsai (1831–1889), whose painting Wisteria Maiden and Demon Priest is hanging nearby.",
