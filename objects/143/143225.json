  "text": "This tablecloth has been in the family of the maker for more than a century and has been worn and taken care of by four generations of Lakota women. In the late 19th or early 20th Century Oglala Lakota artist Winyan Hcaka (The True Woman) created this exuberantly embellished parlor tablecloth or drum cover. Made from red wool trade cloth, the piece contains a stunning array of multicolored beads and design elements, all beaded in applique-style, producing a smooth and energetic surface.  A “sister” piece is in the collection of the National Museum of the American Indian and is identified as the work of Winyan Hcaka (12/814).",
