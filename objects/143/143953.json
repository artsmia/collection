  "text": "A woman wore this five-piece kimono set only once, at her wedding in 1934. The lavish decoration with its many phoenixes, symbols of fidelity, reflects the hopes of her family for a happy married life. The set consists of five elements: an outer robe (iro uchikake), a long-sleeved kimono with draping train (hiki furisode), a fully tie-dyed undergarment (sō shibori juban), a plain white undergarment (juban), and a brocade sash (obi). The bride would have worn the uchikake over the long-sleeved kimono with a padded train tied at the waist with the sash. The white undergarment would have been worn closest to the body, and the layers would have been visible at the openings, especially around the collar.",
