  "text": "A hand-painted palampore on a cream satin ground. The field of the palampore is dominated by a stand of green and blue-green bamboo shoots and mature stalks issuing from a verdant green mound, intertwined with a lone tree whose sinuous branches sprout a variety of blue, pink, purple, and orange flowers that fill the sky. Smaller flowering and fruiting trees roughly disposed in two pairs flank the central group in the foreground. The wide border, symmetrically arranged along a central axis at each side, represents more trees of varying type growing from an alternating series of blue, orange, and brown rocky clusters.",
