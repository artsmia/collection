  "text": "Paulina Peavy was a formally trained artist who worked professionally and made spiritually based organic figural work. After attending a séance in the 1930s she claimed that she was contacted by an entity calling itself Lacamo and from then on, she and Lacamo were artistic collaborators. She made art channeling Lacamo and the two of them signed the work. Peavy made “trance masks” in order to better tune in Lacamo’s vibrational communications.",
