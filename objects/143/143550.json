  "text": "Matsukawa Hiromi’s ceramics are characterized by an earthy, rustic look. Although he lives and works in Okayama Prefecture, which is known for Bizen ware, he creates Shigaraki ware using Shigaraki clay, whose feldspar inclusions create a rough surface. This type of container is called a yahazuguchi, or “arrow-notch mouth,” because the opening is recessed, and the lid sits on a notched inner rim. Matsukawa formed the lid handle by folding a strip of clay into a heart shape.",
