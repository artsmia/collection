  "text": "A large, stout, cylindrical container with four sides pushed in. Viewed from the side, the container flares at the top and bottom, with thick rims. The circular lid has a tab formed from a ribbon of clay folded into a U and pressed together, with one indentation on one side and two on the other. The lid has circular indentations, in which glaze has pooled. The glaze is greenish gray in color and shiny, with some reddish brown areas that are duller. The sides of the cylinder are deliberately\r\nmarked with slashes in the form of a diamond. The surface of the container is bumpy, with horizontal lines from using a wheel.",
