  "text": "Myrlande Constant revolutionized the tradition of Vodou flag-making in Haiti, both by using different materials than the traditional sequins and by expanding the subject matter. She learned beadwork while working at a wedding dress factory as a teenager, an experience that is fundamental to her complex compositions depicting regular people in everyday life. In this work, two figures dance while musicians play amid a vibrant landscape.",
