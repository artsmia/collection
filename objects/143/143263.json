  "text": "Bal Kontredans, 2021, is a drapo Vodou or a Vodou flag by the Haitian artist Myrlande Constant. Sewing beads and sequins onto cloth, the artist creates a lavish scene layered with meaning and symbolism within Vodou and Haitian culture. In this work, seven individuals gather around a drum. One plays maracas, another strums a guitar while another plays a harmonica. Smoke, color, and patterns swirl as a man extends an arm to a woman who steps forward clasping her hat. Amid her vibrant landscape, different figures are engaging with each other to perform the ritual at hand.",
