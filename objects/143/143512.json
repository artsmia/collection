  "text": "Charles V was the Holy Roman Emperor from 1519 until his abdication in 1556. He oversaw an empire that included huge swaths of Europe, plus colonies in the Americas. Here he wears the imperial crown and holds a scepter and an orb--suggesting that he holds the world in his hand. Dripping with pearls and gemstones, there can be no doubt about his wealth, power, and status.",
