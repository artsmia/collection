  "text": "Izumita Yukiya makes clay look like paper in his sculpture, “Sekisoh,” which translates to “lamination” or “accumulated layers.” His creative process begins by shaping paper: folding, bending, and twisting paper like origami. To form each layer, he places a piece of wet Japanese washi paper on a thin acrylic board and presses clay onto the paper until he attains the desired thinness. When the clay is dried, he peels off the paper, which leaves a coarse texture on the surface. Izumita is fascinated by weathered, corroded, and dried textures, which he believes encapsulates a certain timelessness – a moment of time in which an object could fall apart but does not. He seeks to capture the tension between fragility and stability in his sculptures.",
