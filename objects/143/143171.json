  "text": "During the Paris Commune of 1871, Alfred Auteroche drove an ambulance for the Republican (national government) side, which defeated the revolutionary Communards who had seized control of Paris and established a government espousing the rights of women, children, and workers. A year after this bloody conflict, the artist exhibited The Harrower at the Paris Salon. The inscription, penned in Latin and French, means “To the man the sword, to the woman the plow”—seemingly a reference to the idea that women were left to work the fields as men fought for their political beliefs. This scene may thus have served as a memorial to the women burdened by the war, and the men lost in it.",
