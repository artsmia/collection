  "text": "A stenciled and painted cotton stole featuring a highly naturalistic morning glory floral pattern, as well as insects, tiny animals, and script. The design is divided into two components designed with vertical direction. Each section is half bordered with densely clustered morning glories, blue on one side and pink on the other. In the center, the floral pattern explodes to include iris, roses, morning glories, sweet peas, and fuchsia surrounded by butterflies and dragonflies. Within the design, amongst areas of the floral pattern are words, names, phrases in English and French, and small motifs such as an eye, faces, a horse and rider, a cow, a cat, and a pig. Cream fringe borders the short sides of the stole, embellished with pink, green, and pale green.",
