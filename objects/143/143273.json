  "text": "In the first half of the nineteenth century, stenciling became a popular artistic enterprise for American and European women. Stenciled designs were applied not only to walls and domestic textile furnishings but to dress items as well. This stenciled cotton textile – possibly meant to have been used as a table runner or stole - is an exceptional example for its condition, densely packed design, saturated colors, sophisticated use of shaded/voided areas, and witty inclusion of free-drawn words and images.",
