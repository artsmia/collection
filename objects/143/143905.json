  "text": "Though perhaps best known as a sculptor, Kiki Smith regularly works in drawing, installation art, and printmaking, a medium she considers of of key importance to her creative practice. In this mixed intaglio print, Smith's presents an anonymous woman (Josephine) in profound grief, shedding an oversized red teardrop that she cradles in her hands. Intended as metaphor, Smith's protrayal of grief is one of universal relevance, perhaps even more so today than in 1999 when she originally produced the print.",
