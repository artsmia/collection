  "text": "This rare pair of screens provides insight into the types of military encampment settings and battle formations used during the sixteenth and early seventeenth century. \r\nOne shows the delineation for an encampment of almost 11 acres for a unit (sonae) which is led by a feudal lord (daimyo). The other shows the deployment of battalions starting from the top with light infantry (ashigaru) units, armed with matchlock rifles. Each type of soldier is indicated with a different color and on the left side of each screen is a legend that explains what the colors stand for. Varying amounts of text accompany the screens that provide rules or guidelines.",
