  "text": "As a student, Tanaka Yū initially studied oil painting but soon switched over to ceramics because she liked the physical demands of working with clay. Nonetheless, her interest in painting is reflected in her preference of bright colors over the typical earth tones of ceramics. \r\nTanaka’s ceramics emphasize form over function, and literally covers up the utility of everyday vessels such as bowls, jars, planters, and plates. Her colorful pieces encourage viewers to guess what could lie inside. To create her bundles, she coil-builds her forms with blended clay that contains Shigaraki soil, which increases its pliability. She achieves the smooth surface by sponging the surface and then brushing or air-brushing the clay slip. She applies pigment before and after the firing.",
