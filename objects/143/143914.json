  "text": "Pamela Phatsimo Sunstrum’s mixed media painting, Front Room, features the artist’s alter-ego Asme (“as me”) seated centrally in a domestic interior accompanied by three other women. Two of the women hold Asme’s hands, offering comfort and assurance, while the third appears distracted, attending to her personal appearance. Sunstrum’s composition references a similar scene in the 1866 painting La Fiancée Hésitante (The Hesitant Fiancée) by 19th-century French Salon painter Auguste Toulmouche (1829-1895). In contrast to the bourgeois sentiment of Toulmouche’s painting, in which a bride-to-be reveals momentary doubt, here Asme expresses barely restrained rage, a defiant reaction to her realization of powerlessness over social and cultural expectations that frequently regulate women’s roles, behavior, or appearance. With its reductive design, flattened pictorial space, and conspicuous patterning, Front Room also demonstrates Sunstrum's decorative impuse experienced within a woman's domain.",
