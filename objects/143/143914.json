  "text": "A simplified domestic interior scene featuring a central, seated woman (a bride-to-be) who looks directly at the viewer with an expression of barely restrained rage. She is accompanied by two women, one on each side of her, who appear to be soothing her with genuine concern, each holding a hand of the seated figure. A fourth woman stands in the background, seemingly uninterested in the human drama unfolding nearby, peering into a mirror and attending to her personal appearance. The women's attire consists of colorful, patterned dresses.",
