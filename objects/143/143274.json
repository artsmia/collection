  "text": "Large-scale narrative work depicting the standoff between Water Protectors and law enforcement during the North Dakota Access Pipeline protests. The work features a number of vignettes that lampoon politicans, call out militarization of law enforcement, and racist responses. The work is predominently olive green and muted, dark tones of lavendar purple. An orange river runs through the foreground from the lower right corner to the center left edge of the canvas. Intersecting the river is a navy blue pipeline that stretches from the lower left corner to the upper right quadrant. Green rolling hills create a horizon line in the upper center half of the work. The sky is composed of purple, pink, and blue silhouettes.",
