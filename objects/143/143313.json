  "text": "Little is known about the career of Ernest-André Andreas. We do know that he was treated for depression by Dr. Paul Gachet, the physician who cared for the Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh in 1890. At age 31, Andreas appears to have drowned in the Oise, a river that flows near Auvers-sur-Oise, the village near Paris where van Gogh ended his life.\r\n\r\nAndreas’s surviving works suggest that the artist made a living in Paris as an illustrator, often for magazines. As Houses in the Moonlight demonstrates, he also took up pastel. In this haunting image of a slightly overcast night scene, the shapes of the buildings and the water in the foreground are only just discernible.",
