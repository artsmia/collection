  "text": "Land-grant colleges and universities in the United States (including the University of Minnesota) were funded by the seizure and development of Indigenous land. Kalen Goodluck’s photographs, from an award-winning investigative article for High Country News (Colorado), highlight that history. Here, a chain-link gateway becomes a metaphor for the 11 million acres of Indigenous land taken through the Morrill Land-Grant Act of 1862, signed into law by Abraham Lincoln.",
