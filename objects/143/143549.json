  "text": "The shape of this vessel derives from bowls used by Buddhist monks seeking alms—an expression of their humility. However, this bowl was produced in Burma (now Myanmar) when it was ruled by Britain (1858–1947), and thus reflects the tastes of British collectors for exotic luxury goods. Consisting of a complex combination of repoussé and chasing techniques, the bowl was fashioned by the internationally acclaimed silversmith Maung Shwe Yon, who exhibited his wares in the 1883–84 International Exposition in Calcutta (now Kolkata). The scenes recount the harrowing story of the Buddhist nun Patacara, who suffered the tragic death of her husband, children, and parents. She overcame these hardships after encountering the Buddha, who helped her understand the transient nature of life and the impermanence of all things.",
