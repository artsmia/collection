  "text": "This cape has been in the family of the maker for more than a century and has been worn and taken care of by four generations of Lakota women. In the late 19th or early 20th Century Lakota artist Winyan Hcaka (The True Woman) created this extraordinary cape for her daughter, Mary Julia. The cape, with abundant floral designs in a dazzling array of colors, is made to be worn on very special occasions. Constructed from a supple brain tanned hide with beads sewn onto the work with sinew, the cape adorns the wearer in a particular form of Lakota figurative art made by women, floral designs. The artist then incorporates abstract lane-stitch beadwork at the border of the cape. She then finishes the piece by sewing a thin piece of hide as the base for fringe, meticulously wrapping more than one hundred red porcupine quilled tassels.",
