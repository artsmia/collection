  "text": "Charlene Burningham was an integral member of the Midwest fiber art community and was herself a highly regarded but underrecognized artist. Burningham studied art under Walt Nottingham at University of Wisconsin River Falls as well as the University of Minnesota Twin Cities where she completed her MFA and was eventually hired as a professor in the Design Department c. 1970. Later, Burningham would become a leader in the art quilt movement, and many of her students at the University of Minnesota – especially Jan Myers Newbury, Deb Lund, and Margaret Miller – went on to have successful careers. Burningham created “Promethean Orange” just before she embarked on her teaching career at the University of Minnesota.",
