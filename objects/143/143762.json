  "text": "A man pauses for a break from his day or perhaps is just begining his morning. He holds a newspaper open while smoking a cigarette, his coffee mug near at hand. Is he on break from work or looking for work among the classified ads? The artist has carefully depicted the man's fit, solid muscular body and sharply focused attention. We are left as viewers to puzzle out and wonder about his life and this moment, as he is captured in between events in his day.",
