  "text": "A Navajo woman made this Third Phase Chief Blanket around 1865 during the Late Classic period of Navajo weaving (1860-1875), when Navajo artists made some of the most spectacular textiles in history. The pattern of this textile is emblematic of hozho, a fundamental philosophical concept for the Navajo people that emphasizes the connection between beauty, symmetry, balance, order, and grace.",
