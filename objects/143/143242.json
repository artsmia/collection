  "text": "Night #9 is an excellent example of Wolf’s signature framing of the Hong Kong skyline—a vista without earth or sky, gridded to all sides with concrete and artificial lights.  Within the bright fenestrations of the towers, human forms appear antlike in scale and anonymous in description, ribbons of concrete streaming between them.  While not quite a horror, the view Wolf frames is disturbing: the lack of geographical referents heightens the viewer’s sense of claustrophobia as they imagine life within those wan grey towers.",
