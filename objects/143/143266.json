  "text": "This long metal pipe might look like a delicate, fashionable accessory, but weighs nearly one and a half pounds and is made entirely of metal. In the Edo period, smoking was a common but expensive activity, and intricately decorated pipes were considered status symbols. Depending on the situation, a person could use the pipe to smoke tobacco, or could brandished it like a baton or a club. In Edo-period Japan, only samurai were allowed to carry swords.  Young merchant-class ruffians called machi yakko often kept them as a weapon in case they got involved in fights with low-class samurai or other troublemakers. While samurai were usually armed, when they had to disarm themselves for some reason (such as visits to the pleasure quarters), they would carry a metal pipe instead for self-protection.",
