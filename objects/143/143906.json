  "text": "Though perhaps best known as a sculptor, Kiki Smith regularly works in drawing, installation art, and printmaking, a medium she considers of of central importance to her creative practice. In this mixed intaglio print, Smith likely casts herself in the role of the ballerina, dancing on point while wearing an elegant dress that accentuates the grace and beauty of her performative movement. More metaphor than narrative, the portrayal is a visual manifestation of traditional feminity and attention-focusing charisma.",
