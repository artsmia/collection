  "text": "Eight women sit around a table together to work on a quilt. They busy themselves with sewing, cutting, embellishing the design. Around them many generations of people interact and play -- from children to an older woman rocking in a chair with a child. A man peeks in from the doorway, perhaps wondering if his presence is welcome -- and he is greeted by a woman offering a carafe of coffee. The whole room is lively with talk and activity, adding to a warm mood.",
