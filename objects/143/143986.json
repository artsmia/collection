  "text": "“I was on an assignment for the New York Times and covered the Navajo Nation reopening during the pandemic when I photographed Naomii Young. Sheep shearing was one of the subjects that I wanted to document. I met Naomii, and she and her family were sheep shearing, which I'd never really seen before. It was really interesting to go and see her environment and the land and everything. It was fun. It was interesting to watch, learn, and see the bonds that the family had with each other.”\r\n—Sharon Chischilly",
