  "text": "Nancy Lee Katz devoted twenty-five years to photographing individuals in the arts whom she admired and were part of her “Pantheon.” The sitters are leading figures in their fields, including the artist Helen Frankenthaler, the composer George Walker, and the architect Philip Johnson, each posed in a space or with an object that speaks to their work. No two photographs are the same, however, even within the same field of endeavor. Katz sensitively photographed each sitter, allowing their personalities and individuality to come through.",
