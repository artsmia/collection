  "text": "Tsukamoto Kaiji’s intricately carved and glazed porcelains are based on Ding and Qingbai wares of the Chinese Song dynasty (960–1278). The delicacy of Tsukamoto’s bowls rival those of his historical predecessors, and in 1983 he was designated a “Living National Treasure” by the Japanese government.\r\nThis perfectly round tea bowl would have been used only in summer—shallow bowls help cool the tea—and is decorated with karakusa, an abstract pattern of winding plants.",
