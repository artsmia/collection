  "text": "Photographer and filmmaker Shelley Niro (Mohawk) writes: “Nadya Kwandibens is a young storyteller from the northern bush country of Ontario, Canada. She carries her camera like an extension of her body. As evidenced by her prolific photo works, Kwandibens is committed to showing her community to the world: their faces, their livelihoods, and their love for their culture. In this photo, Tee Lyn Duke stands on a subway platform in Toronto, wearing her traditional jingle dress. As commuters move around her, leaving their blurred impressions, Duke stands like a statue. She reminds me of the Indigenous female presence that has walked in this landscape, hunted these forests, and still can be seen and felt in this highly commodified environment known as Tkaronto, now Toronto.”",
