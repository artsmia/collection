  "text": "This small-format album from 1907 is the earliest documented of the 15 albums known by Kodōjin. His signature is not found in this album, the artist opting instead to disperse 18 different seals throughout it. The six paintings in Album of What Exists are all ink landscapes. They offer a range of scenic views and how to render them, including, for the first time, a mountain range in the style of the Chinese painter-calligrapher Mi Fu (Mi Fei, 1051–1107) that he would frequently revisit throughout the remainder of his career.",
