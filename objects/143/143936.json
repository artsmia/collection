  "text": "Approach-Avoidance #13 exemplifies Judith Roode's conceptual approach and distinctive gestural drawing style. Here, she depicts two figures seen from the shoulders up, lying prone, head to head, separate but close together in an ambiguous orientation and setting. Part of an extensive series of studio drawings Roode began in 1982, this example evokes a palpable but unresolved psychological tension between the pair of figures. For the viewer, the drawing's meaning is suggested by the title of the work, though Roode also invites subjective interpretation from personal memories and associations.",
