  "text": "Approach-Avoidance #13 typifies Judith Roode's conceptual approach and distinctive gestural drawing style. Here, she depicts two figures seen from the shoulders up, lying prone, head to head, separate but close together in an indefinite orientation and setting. Part of her best known \"Approach-Avoidance\" series of the 1980s, the drawing evokes a palpable but unresolved psychological tension between the figures. For the viewer, the drawing's meaning is suggested by the title of the work, though Roode also invites interpretation through personal memories and associations.",
