  "text": "A procession of three figures stroll along a straight path cut into a verdant countryside. One of them, a girl in a golden yellow dress holding a small bouquet of flowers, walks ahead of two women whose heads are turned one to the other as if in deep conversation. One of the women is dressed in a black gown with a red tiara and muslin veil over her black hair. She is painted with her head in profile as she inclines it towards her companion who is dressed in a long white gown and wears her auburn hair in two braids that hang down her back.",
