  "text": "In 1861 The Florentine painter Raffaello Sorbi was awarded a prize at the Florentine Triennale for his history painting of the dying Corso Donati, a Florentine aristocrat and leader of a failed rebellion who was killed in 1308. 1861 was also the year in which many of the independent states on the Italian peninsula united to form the Kingdom of Italy. Sorbi played his part in celebrating the Italian spirit, painting a wide range of subjects drawn from the Bible, ancient Rome, and genre scenes of figures in 18th century dress. His most original contribution, however, lies in the highly finished paintings of an imagined Florence of the Middle Ages. The Evening Walk is one of his most compelling in this manner.",
