  "text": "Judith Roode's charcoal pencil drawing, Annuncaition, reveals her distinctive gestural drawing style and conceptual approach, with figures often placed in indeterminate settings. Here, the subject is narrative, inspired by the Annunciation as described in the Bible's Gospel of Luke, in which the angel Gabriel informs Mary that she would conceive and bear a son through a virgin birth and become the mother of Jesus Christ. Roode presents the scene in an ambiguous and partly obsured architectural setting that focuses the viewer’s attention on the psychological impact and spiritual manifestations of the momentous event.",
