  "text": "This piece consists of several interrelated sculptural elements. On the right is a cabinet on four legs\r\nfit with an array of old electronics including levers, buttons, and gauges. A separate device fit with\r\ndials and knobs sits on top of that. It has a handle on the top suggesting that it could be portable\r\nand used in the field. A cord runs from this ensemble to the next. On the left a much taller structure\r\nconsists of a rusty metal box upon which sits a tall wire cage within which is held a long metal\r\nstructure like a stretched basket, topped with what resembles a big thimble. Glass crystals shaped\r\nlike large teardrops are hung at intervals throughout the wire cage.",
