  "text": "If you could make a device that would harness the power of the spirit realm to transform the hearts\r\nof human beings into emanations of pure love, what might that look like' What would it need to\r\ndo' How would it work. These are some of the ideas that artist Renee Stout played with in making\r\nthis piece. It is an absurd imaginary machine that works in conjunction with otherworldly forces in\r\norder to remove bad thoughts and intentions from people. But it might also connect on a\r\nwavelength that allows the artist to communicate with spirits, or even extraterrestrial beings.",
