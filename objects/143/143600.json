  "text": "Laura Aguilar was drawn to the “festive” ambiance at the now-shuttered lesbian bar the Plush Pony in East Los Angeles. Inspired by the Plush Pony’s clientele of mostly Chicana and Mexican working-class women, she decided she “wanted to show the whole community, not just half a community.” She photographed there against the backdrop of the civil unrest of the 1992 Los Angeles riots, in a space that provided both physical and emotional safety. The women here engage directly with Aguilar, appearing powerful and secure in their identities.",
