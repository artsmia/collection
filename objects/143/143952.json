  "text": "In 1934, a woman wore this five-piece kimono set at her wedding. Though we know little about her life, the lavish decoration on her kimono reflects the hopes of her family that she lead a happy life as a wife. Once a woman wed, she was no longer part of her birth family, but rather a member of her husband’s family. The set consists of an outer robe (iro uchikake), a long-sleeved kimono with draping train (hiki furisode), a fully shibori-dyed undergarment (sō shibori juban), a plain white undergarment (juban), and a brocade sash (obi). A bride would wear the uchikake over the long-sleeved kimono with a padded train tied at the waist with the sash. The white undergarment would have been worn closest to the body, and the layers would have been visible at the openings, especially around the collar.",
