  "text": "With his shoulder-length hair, wearing bell bottoms and a headband, photographer Larry McNeil is the central figure in Real Indians. Standing beneath an enormous hand-painted sign running the length of a one-story building, McNeil is a living counterpoint to the exploitative language written across this roadside attraction—a site promising tourists that they can “Visit, Watch, Trade” with “Real Indians.” McNeil created an instantly legible critique of tourist culture and its long-standing exoticization and objectification (if not outright erasure) of Indigenous people. At the same time, and through his casual stance, McNeil conveys an ironic ease that effectively negates the sign’s multiple distortions.",
