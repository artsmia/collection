  "text": "As an original member of the photography collective NIIPA, Thomas was crucial  in the development of the photographic medium within Native North American communities, as well as its recognition by national and international institutions of art and culture. His depiction of a young boy standing to the left of the words “Cultural Revolution” spray painted upon a brick wall is iconic of his activism in the 1980s, which was especially focused upon uplifting and making visible urban Native experience. In the artist’s own words, “When I began working with a camera in 1980, there was no photo-based conversation about the urban Indigenous experience. I was born and raised in Buffalo, New York, and as my elder always said, talk about what  you know. Since I had no existing Indigenous-made paradigm in photography, my quest was to develop one.” Thomas’ photograph is revolutionary in its reframing of Native identity within an urban context, and in its generational implications for the same.",
