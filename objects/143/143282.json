  "text": "Harriet Bart is a Minnesota based artist and was a founding member of the feminist art collective WARM (Women’s Art Registry of Minnesota) established in 1973. Over time, Bart’s work has evolved to embrace a variety of media, but textiles were a primary preoccupation of hers in the 1970s during the height of the US fiber art and related wearable art movement. “Waiting, ” was initially part of a larger group of five similarly constructed fiber components together entitled “Rivers of Silence” but “Waiting” was sold to a private collector when the group was displayed at WARM’s Minneapolis gallery in 1978. The other four components of the assemblage, “Knowing, ” “Watching, ” Wailing, ” and “Wasting, ” were acquired by Mia in 1997. The important acquisition of “Waiting” completes the “Rivers of Silence” set.",
