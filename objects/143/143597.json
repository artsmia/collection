  "text": "Throughout much of her career, the Chicana artist Laura Aguilar focused her lens on herself and her communities. In these two photographs, Aguilar evokes the art historical tradition of the nude in the landscape by centering the camera upon herself and other women. By the artist’s own account, her photographs brought into view “women, people of color, gays and lesbians” in spaces that were historically inaccessible to people holding these identities. At the same time, Aguilar used the camera to interrogate cis, white, and heteronormative ideas of beauty and belonging. Harmoniously posed among stones and trees, Aguilar’s and her sitters’ bodies seem both eternal and integral to the landscape.",
