  "text": "Where are we, as viewers, in this landscape' Is this a place on Earth, from which we witness UFOs entering our atmosphere' Or are we on a distant planet, witnessing the UFOs returning home' Macena Barton’s painting is exciting and mysterious, as befits the subject. She made the painting at a time of great geopolitical tension between the United States and the Soviet Union around a nuclear arms race. Made the year after Russian cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first human launched into space, this painting registers the excitement, strangeness, and adventure posed by the possibility of visitors from other worlds.",
