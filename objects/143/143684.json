  "text": "In addition to his poetry and painting, from at least 1923 onward Kodōjin joined with various craftsmen in composing poems for and creating decorations on their artworks. Such collaborations were firmly grounded in the literati tradition. They attest to Kodōjin’s versatility, expanding his art practice to attract clients who would not otherwise have been interested in acquiring a painting or a calligraphy.",
