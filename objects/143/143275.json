  "text": "At a time of political divide, Alec Soth set out on a journey across the United States intending to follow the  path of President Abraham Lincoln’s funeral train. While on the trip he became more interested in photography’s physical, historical, and conceptual weights. \r\nA landscape photograph looms heavily above the hotel bed. Soth’s daughter, Carmen, who has collaborated with him in the past, is serious in repose. With his view camera just at left, Soth places himself within the composition, possibly depicting a moment of rest or tension in their joint travels.",
