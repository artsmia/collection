  "text": "Willie Birch was born and raised in New Orleans, where he still lives and works. This large composition honors the workers and community in the city that perpetually rebuild and make improvements to homes and businesses there, expecially in the long impact of hurricane damage. At first glance it might appear to be one continuous scene; but it is bisected in the center and presents a before (bottom) and after (top) sequence of gradual progress. Birch notes that his ambitious painting is in honor of artist Jacob Lawrence, who made a series of works depicting Black builders, taking pride in neighborhood renovations, late in life.",
