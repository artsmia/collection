  "text": "Kali Spitzer’s artistic practice is a reclamation and reappropriation of tintype photography that centers the narratives of marginalized people. Her practice creates an intimate and communal space where vulnerability is celebrated as an act of resilience and empathy. Spitzer says: “I think that Indigenous women, trans, and nonbinary people, as well as people of color, the Black and brown and queer community, that we are often not seen or heard. And there’s so much violence committed against our communities, so part of my idea, part of my hope, is that by making beautiful, intense, loving images that are so large . . . I’m hoping to make a deep, human connection.”",
