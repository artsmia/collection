  "text": "A woman emerges from a flower or colorful plant. She and the plant are dressed and decorated in eye-dazzling multicolored patterns. This is the work of a Czech medium who made such drawings at seances (communal rituals to contact spirits) in a trance state. Pecka would have entered a state in which he allowed spirits to guide his hand and bring forth images of the spirits trying to convey messages. This drawing resulted from one of those sessions.",
