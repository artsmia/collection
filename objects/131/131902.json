  "text": "In this eye-dazzling concert poster by Bill Henry, both the barely discernable central image of a silent film actress (inverted) and the various text elements take a back seat to the contrasting arrays of brilliant reds and blues that give the appearance of a deeply receding pictorial space. Likely meant to resemble the interior of an early movie theater, the visual effects of the “vibrating” color scheme are the most memorable aspects of Henry’s innovative design.",
