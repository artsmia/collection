  "text": "Just as Herbert Singleton was finishing this coffee table, he heard one of his friends get shot in the back around the corner. Many of Singleton’s works reflect the violence and “confusion” he witnessed in a poverty-stricken African American neighborhood in New Orleans. Confusion is a technical term in New Orleans voodoo culture, but to Singleton it also meant destruction and moral depravity. Singleton often used Biblical scenes, like this crucifixion, to expose confusion. The group to the left, clustered around the man named Pontius Pilate who condemned Christ to die, seem stricken and uncertain. Pontius Pilate frowns, while his wife whispers that Christ is innocent in his ear. To the group on the right, Christ’s mother and followers seem impassive and sure. Perhaps Singleton dappled the painted sky above deliberately to reflect the confusion below.",
