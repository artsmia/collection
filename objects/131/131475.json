  "text": "Nellie Mae Rowe uses brilliant colors to reimagine the inside of her home, which she called her “playhouse.” Rowe created the drawing soon after learning she had cancer. Her personal visual language, developed over her decades as an artist, seems to tell a story. Empty chairs appeared in many of the compositions she made in the year leading up to her death. Drooping plants might suggest fading life, while the dolls recall the creative play of her youth. A grid organizes the picture, possibly referencing the quilts she made in her childhood.",
