  "text": "Shepperton is as ancient village, dating back more than a thousand years and situated on the River Thames. As is often the case with Seymour Haden’s work, he shows us a place that would soon change in character. In this case, the railroad arrived in Shepperton the same year Haden made this etching. Soon the process of suburbanization began. The large house with many chimneys was sufficiently picturesque that other artists also depicted it in the 1800s, but a scan of photos of Shepperton suggests that it no longer stands.",
