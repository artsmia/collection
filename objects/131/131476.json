  "text": "The tall striped hat, cape, and heels of the figure on the left suggest the costume of a drum major (the person who leads a parade). If Henry Speller intended this scene to be a parade, however, it seems an uncertain celebration. The image of a canon often suggests violence and war, but it looks as though the mouth of this one spews confetti rather than a lead ball. The figures’ fixed smiles and wide open eyes make the faces seem more mask-like than human. Perhaps the celebration is a performance, or a sham, as well. Conflict and opposition seem present even in a moment of joy.",
