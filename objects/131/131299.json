  "text": "Modupeola Fadugba’s Pink Honey frames the history of swimming in her portrait of one of the Harlem Honeys and Bears, an all‑Black synchronized swim group for senior citizens. Fadugba interviewed members of the team, learning about their complex relationship to swimming—an activity from which non‑whites were often excluded throughout American history. By burning the paper, Fadugba references one of the many instances in which Black swimmers confronted verbal and physical abuse while trying to use a pool. In one incident cited by the artist, a hotel owner poured acid on a group of Black and white protesters who refused to leave a segregated pool in St. Augustine, Florida, in 1964. “These swimmers … explore the power of togetherness to defy the odds and transcend debilitating stereotypes,” Fadugba notes. “These are not unrelated issues; they are inextricably intertwined with the history of this community, but what has brought them together is their love for swimming.”",
