  "text": "The work on paper made with a combination of pencil, acrylic, and ink on burned paper. The paper is a rectangle that is longer than it is wide. The work is a portrait of an older Black woman wearing a swimsuit, posed on the edge of a pool. The subject’s hair or swimsuit are left blank. The sitter is depicted in a grey scale, while the background is colored in a matte, blush pink color. The edges and select portions of the work are burned, which creates a golden brown discoloration and holes in the work.",
