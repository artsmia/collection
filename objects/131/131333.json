  "text": "This Daoist deity is an example of the sancai, or three-color, technique, in which a combination of three glazes of different colors—typically brown, green, and creamy white—was used by Chinese potters to decorate ceramic figures. This figure’s dignified clothing and commanding front-facing pose, indicate it is likely Tianzun. Tianzun is one of three Daoist deities, the supreme rulers of the Daoist pantheon. The figure was intended to inspire devotion and obedience when viewed in a temple or shrine.",
