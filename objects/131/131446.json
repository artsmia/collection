  "text": "Jesse Aaron worked largely with found wood. He may have coaxed this sculpture of a shark, with a rattle in its mouth and a baby on its back, out of a fence post or the limb of a tree. Wood splinters around the mouth that Aaron gauged to form the face of the shark mirror the teeth that he embedded in the lower jaw. Aaron often used found objects in his carvings. The sculpture hangs from a stretch of electrical wire so that the doll hovers just above the shark’s back. The rough-hewn and inventive material of the sculpture creates an interesting juxtaposition with the object’s fanciful subject-matter.",
