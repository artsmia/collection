  "text": "Technique: Stencil resist dye (katazome)\r\nThis textile was either used as a bedding (futonji) or a furniture cover (yutan). Futonji were draped over the coverlet at night and stored during the day, while yutan were used to cover chests or baggage first during the bridal procession and later in the couple’s new home. This elegant example is made of silk dyed a golden yellow and decorated with the pine-bark diamond (matsukawabishi) pattern using a stencil and starch paste, which kept the dye from penetrating the silk. Named for its resemblance to the bark of pine trees, this motif consists of a zigzag pattern, which forms a series of lozenges.",
