  "text": "Joshua Huyser’s landscapes often strike a balance between abstraction and representational art. In Whiteout, a police car and officer appear as blobs on the horizon, a familiar sight to any resident of the wintry north. With the snowy haze and flashing lights, he captures the anxiety, confusion, and danger of driving through a blinding snowstorm, and nature’s sublime vastness is palpable in a work about the size of a sheet of letterhead paper.",
