  "text": "Prophet Royal Robertson uses heavy black lines and thin washes of paint to create this peaceful, sci-fi scene. Art played multiple roles in Robertson’s life. In his yard, Robertson planted aggressive signs meant to repel the unholy or unworthy. Pictures like this one, however, convey more personal dreams. Beginning in childhood, Robertson experienced visions as an escape-hatch from everyday\nlife. This particular image came to him in 1980 AD, according to the inscription at the bottom. He signed the image “Patriarch Royal Robertson” rather than “Prophet Royal Robertson,” a sign of how his art provided him with a platform for his evolving sense of self.",
