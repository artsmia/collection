  "text": "Japan comprises over 6, 000 islands, and many coastal communities depend on the fishing industry. Sea creatures and water motifs were particularly popular subjects for festive garments worn by men whose livelihoods were tied to the bounty of the sea. Such kimonos were worn during traditional festivals (matsuri) organized to solicit favor from the gods to ensure the well-being of local communities.\r\nThis exuberant indigo-dyed robe appeals for a fruitful catch. It features over 20 different fish, many types of clams and oysters, a lobster, and an octopus. The motifs were all hand-drawn using many dyes (pinks, gray, brown, and indigo) and a technique called tsutsugaki, which involves the application of rice paste through a narrow tube to protect certain areas from immersion dye, thus rendering the various hues.",
