  "text": "This garment is a uniform worn by boys when practicing kendo, a traditional Japanese martial art that descends from swordsmanship. Ease of movement is essential; hence its narrow sleeves and slits along the seams on the lower half. To reinforce the fabric and protect the wearer from the blows of opponents during practice, the upper half is embroidered with an interconnected pattern called asanoha, a stylized hemp leaf. On the back of the garment are three unique renditions of cherry blossoms placed within a lozenge shape, called matsukawabishi.",
