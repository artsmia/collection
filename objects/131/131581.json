  "text": "A noblewoman likely wore this robe. Made of cotton, a costly imported fabric, it is identifiable as a ryūso (Ryūkyūan robe) by the gussets (triangular pieces of material) under the attached sleeves, the short sleeve length, and the long lapels. This garment would have been worn in the colder winter months, when temperatures dipped to the mid-50s Fahrenheit. \r\nThe complex pattern of swirling water, cranes, plum blossoms, and other plants was achieved through bingata, the repeated use of a stencil through which a resist paste was applied. The paste blocked the dye from entering the fabric, and these undyed areas were later colored in by hand.",
