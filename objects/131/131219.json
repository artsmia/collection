  "text": "This image, clearly recalling a traditional depiction of the Virgin and Child, is part of a project that Georges Rouault worked on between 1922 and 1927, a series of 58 intaglio plates on the subject of misery. The images deal with various themes, such as the World War of a few years earlier, the loneliness of everyday life, and the Passion of Christ. When seen as a group, the sorrow and sacrifice of these themes become comingled. Due to commercial and wartime disruptions, the series was not published until 1948.",
