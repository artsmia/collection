  "text": "Undergarments provided a second layer for warmth in winter or to shield outer clothes from sweat in summer. This sleeveless vest would have been worn as an undergarment in warmer weather. It is decorated with a combination of stencil-resist dyeing and tie-dyeing. The underlying fishnet pattern was achieved by binding the fabric tightly to a pole, leaving some areas exposed to absorb the indigo dye. The overlapping-circles motif depicts an hourglass-shaped drum (tsuzumi) with cords attached, lying on its side. This element was added in a secondary dyeing process involving a stencil.",
