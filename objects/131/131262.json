  "text": "For almost 60 years, Kwame Brathwaite has created positive images of African Americans and promoted the beauty of everyday people. Working as an artist and theorist, Brathwaite made photographs of African Americans that defied negative stereotypes and depicted a new vision of Black people. Together with his brother Elombe, Brathwaite cofounded Grandassa Models in the early 1960s, a Harlem-based modeling group that celebrated the beauty of Black women’s bodies and natural hair through fashion shows and photography. The Grandassa Models were the first to openly promote the powerful slogan “Black Is Beautiful, ” defying the white, European-dominated fashion trends of the day and defining beauty on their own terms.",
