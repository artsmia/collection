  "text": "A mill was recorded in this area in the Domesday Book in 1086. At that time, the mill was used to wash woolen cloth. In more recent times the waterpower was used for sawing lumber.\r\n\r\nMore than twenty years after etching this plate, Francis Seymour Haden recorded his thoughts about the work and its fate. He said that the detail would be impossible for him at his more advanced age. He knew it would always be among his most popular etchings, though he thought that several others from his later in his career were better artistically. We learn from his printer, Frederick Goulding, that in 1880, Haden wanted to alter or strengthen the image; so, he re-bit the plate—re-exposed it to acid. Together the men spent a snowy day printing new impressions. \r\n\r\nDissatisfied with the result, Haden destroyed the day’s prints and the plate.",
