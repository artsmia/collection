  "text": "On ceremonial occasions, Ainu women wore necklaces (tamasay) made of glass beads. While fashionable, the necklaces also were believed to offer the wearer spiritual protection. The beads could have originated from Russia, China, or even Central Asia; medallions (shitoki) were imported from China and Japan. Highly treasured, especially those with medallions, these necklaces were passed down from generation to generation.\r\nLikely made by Japanese craftsmen, this medallion is decorated with floral motifs—encircled triple hollyhock in the middle and bamboo leaves with gentian flowers on the rim—that are typical family crests in Japan.",
