  "text": "The woman looks like a strange insect specimen pinned to a card for observation. And she certainly is strange—her legs and arms are switched, and part of her torso is reversed. Eldren M. Bailey may have had bugs on his mind when he made the sculpture. The title, Spider Woman, could describe her strange bent limbs or refer to the folk-hero Anansi, who often appears as a spider. Tales of the sly trickster Anansi traveled with slaves from the Akan people of present day Ghana to the United States, where Anansi is also known as Aunt Nancy and Sis’ Nancy. Bailey primarily made sculptures to put in his yard, but Spider Woman is one of two sculptures of sexualized women that he kept in his home.",
