  "text": "Francis Seymour Haden has taken us to a favorite spot on the River Ribble northwest England. The wading cows are charming enough, but the real action lies beneath calm surface of the water. Salmon were abundant in the area, and the river remains an important breeding ground for the endangered Atlantic salmon. The nets drying on sticks along the riverbank were used to catch fish in great numbers. Commercial fishing continues there today.",
