  "text": "This quilt employs a “Housetop” pattern uncommon outside of Gee’s Bend, a small, rural community in Alabama now known for its creative, unconventional quilts. The design seems symmetrical until you notice that Mooney sewed extra fabric onto the blocks on the 72 right. The imbalance seems to set the vibrant colors of the quilt in motion, the right angles of the squares responding to the rectangular border. Lottie Mooney was born in 1902 in Gee’s Bend. Hers was just the second generation to be born after the abolition of slavery. In 2006, this quilt was featured in a Gee’s Bend series of USPS postage stamps.",
