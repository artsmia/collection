  "text": "The crest on the upper back of this coat is of an encircled triple comma oriented counter-clockwise. The repeated character in archaic seal script at the bottom reads hon 本. It can have many meanings, and it is unclear what was intended here. The name Itakura 板倉, also in seal script, appears on the collar; it was either the name of a merchant family or of a shop that likely paid to have these expensive coats created and then given to the firefighters. This very public investment in the safety of the community was also good for business, as many merchants and shops supported firefighters through gifts of parade clothing.",
