  "text": "A farmer would have worn this jacket while working in the fields. Made of hemp and cotton, the entire surface is covered with sashiko, a decorative stitching applied to reinforce the fabric. Its simplicity of form, construction, and decoration provides a showcase for the gradations of color. Through its distinct areas of fading, we can read the contours of a man’s active body: the shoulders and outer sides of the sleeves are worn from sunlight and use. A lighter band at the midriff indicates the point at which a sash closure must have been worn, repeatedly loosened and tightened throughout the workday.",
