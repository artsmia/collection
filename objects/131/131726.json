  "text": "Donza are coats worn by fishermen throughout Japan for festivals and special occasions until the 1930s, when production of them largely ceased. Narrow sleeves and extensive patterns rendered in sashiko, a form of decorative reinforcement stitching that uses cotton thread, are characteristics of this style of coat. Here, remarkably small stitches were placed only a few threads apart, incorporating the contrasting thread to such an extent, and achieving such a degree of regularity, that the pattern almost looks woven into the backing fabric. Its sleeves are decorated with a lattice pattern in yellow cotton thread, and the body of the garment features a complex pattern of arrow-like feathers in light-blue thread.",
