  "text": "Hanya Holm (1893–1992) was a major force in the development of American modern dance. She first studied in her homeland of Germany with expressionist dancer Mary Wigman and then moved to New York in 1931 to share what she’d learned, eventually becoming a giant in the field.\r\n\r\nSara Wallach makes her etchings using shaped plates which she prints repeatedly on a single sheet of paper. Based on a note that she wrote to accompany this etching, it appears that she printed the lower left figure twice, then moved the plate for three more impressions without re-inking.",
