  "text": "This studious young man wears a yarmulke and his hair descends from his temples in sidelocks, called payot. For some Orthodox Jews, this practice is an observance of a biblical injunction against shaving the “Corners” or “edges” of one’s head.  \r\n\r\nKnown primarily as a sculptor, Israeli artist Noemi (Naomi) Schindler was also an accomplished printmaker, working mostly with woodcut. She immigrated to Israel from Berlin in 1936 and moved to Paris in 1965, where she continued her studies, and remained for the rest of her life.",
