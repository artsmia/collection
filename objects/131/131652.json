  "text": "This is a child’s pajamas, or nemaki. The cotton was woven in a type of gauze weave (mojiri-ori), which involved twisting the warp threads between the straight weft threads, resulting in a light, breathable fabric ideal for the hot summer months. A small pattern of double lines, arranged in sets of three and created by resist dyeing the warp threads, decorates it. The lighter blue edges of the undyed sections, where a small amount of indigo entered, give these white lines a luminous, almost flamelike quality.",
