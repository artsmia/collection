  "text": "In this nightmarish image, a shadowy group of small figures cowers before two large figures, one obscured by his cape, the other in silhouette but clearly wielding a sword in his upraised hand. Just one of the small figures is illuminated, a man who turns away from the looming giants. Is he retreating, or is he showing them his rear? As is the case with the other plates in Goya’s series, called Los Proverbios or Disperates [Follies], this image is difficult to pin down.",
