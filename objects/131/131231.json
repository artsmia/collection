  "text": "Hugo Gellert was one of America’s leading political artists of the first half of the 1900s. He dedicated his art to the advancement of socialist ideals. In 1943, in the depths of World War II, he produced a portfolio of nineteen screenprints entitled “Century of the Common Man, ” which served as a visual manifesto of his values. Each plate was devoted to one or two basic ideas; here, the need to transmit democratic values to future generations through education in current events.",
