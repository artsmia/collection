  "text": "This hood of quilted cotton completely covers the head and neck, except for the eyes. It is designed to protect the wearer from both heat and falling debris. The exterior is dyed with indigo, and the interior is dyed red with a motif of undyed white squares. \r\nThe character centered on the forehead is karu 刈, meaning “cutting, ” which may refer to a unit charged with razing structures to prevent the spread of fire. While water and buckets were stored across the city, they were of limited use to stop large blazes. Often, firefighters would contain fires by flattening burning structures with long, hooked poles and grappling hooks.",
