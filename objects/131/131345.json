  "text": "William Rice’s landscapes get their graphic punch from the key block, or line block, here printed in midnight blue. This block was carved with the print’s major details—branches, deep shadows, meandering stretch of creek. As was customary, Rice printed it last, over the other colors. He added texture to the paper by pressing it against canvas when damp.\r\n\r\nRice left Pennsylvania for California in 1900, lured by his friend Frederick Meyer (1872–1961), who founded the California Guild of Arts and Crafts school. Rice taught art there and in public schools in and around Oakland. Meanwhile, he produced some 300 prints. Most celebrate the California landscape, such as this scene of late-spring snow.",
