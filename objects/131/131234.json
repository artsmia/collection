  "text": "A monumental rectangular slab of resin containing compacted layers of kaftans, du-rags, hair curlers, weave hair, hair curlers, feathers, CDs, gold chain and more. Together these elements make an image of two central figures composed of draped caftan dresses with a hollow space where the head would be. The larger figure on the left has a chain draped around its neck. They are surrounded by a halo of silver CDs. The background is a colorful, multilayered and compressed image using fabric with different shapes, color and patterns, along with feathers, hair, curlers, wooden clothespins and feathers. In the upper right-hand corner is a black circular object that creates a moon like image.",
