  "text": "This smoking kit consists of a tobacco box and pipe holder, to which a pipe would have once been attached. Prestige accessories of Ainu men, smoking kits were prominently carried on the belt; the pipe holder was tucked through the belt, leaving the box to dangle. Records show that when Ainu men met for the first time, they exchanged their kits for a smoke and to provide an opportunity to admire each other’s kit.",
