  "text": "Closely identified with the second generation of Abstract Expressionists, Frankenthaler invariably used the basic visual elements of color and pictorial space as a means to achieve an emotional resonance in her non-objective compositions. Her innovative technique of pouring diluted paint directly on unprimed canvas-known as stain painting-was her signature style. This act of pouring became a literal metaphor for larger concepts like nature. Using line, color and texture, her aim is always to make beautiful works that evoke deeper emotions. In Rio Grande, 1987, Frankenthaler chose vivid blues and a muddied red punctuated by gesture marks.",
