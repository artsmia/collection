  "text": "Senegalese photographer Omar Victor Diop is a self-taught artist who draws inspiration for his work from celebrated figures within the African diaspora. Through cinematically composed portrayals of himself in both individual and group portraits, he occupies the position of saints, martyrs, and leaders from a global Black community, conveying its heroism in truly epic style. Were it not for a telltale soccer ball or plastic whistle, one would almost believe his work to be a historic print. \r\n",
