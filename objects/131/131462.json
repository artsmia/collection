  "text": "Lola Pettway was born in 1941, in Gee’s Bend, Alabama, a rural and secluded region now well known for its unique, improvisational quilts. One of 13 children, Pettway says, “I worked hard, came up rough.” Her mother taught her how to quilt. In 1966, more than sixty black women from Alabama formed the Freedom Quilting Bee in order to sell their quilts and secure economic independence. In 1972, the Freedom Quilting Bee secured a contract with Sears to make corduroy pillow shams. Pettway’s mother brought home leftover fabric scraps in “avocado leaf” and “gold.” The rich hues inspired her to make bold compositions like the quilt shown here.",
