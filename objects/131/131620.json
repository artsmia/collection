  "text": "Ceremonial sticks, or ikupasuy, were used by Ainu men in libation ceremonies that included offerings of millet beer or sake. After sprinkling the alcohol on the ground with such a stick to feed the gods and spirits (kamuy), the man used it to prevent his mustache from getting into the drink. All sticks are unique, and their central section is always carved—often with animals and floral designs, sometimes also with narratives or abstract elements. The simple designs at the ends represent the male bloodline, thereby identifying the owner to the gods and spirits.",
