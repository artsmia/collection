  "text": "This set of clothing, called a suō, consists of an unlined, long-sleeved jacket and matching pleated trousers. It was worn by an actor performing kyōgen, lighthearted interludes between acts of more serious noh plays. The costume was based on the formal wear of warriors beginning in the 1300s. The pants extended beyond the performer’s legs and trailed behind as he moved.\r\nThe decoration on this set includes folded cranes and honeycombs meant to evoke turtle shells, both of which are symbols of longevity. The circular crests are called yukiwa ni tanpopo (dandelions enclosed within a snowflake circle), meant to capture the unfailing spirit of kyōgen and Noh actors, like dandelions that bear the cold winter and burst through snow to bloom. All motifs are large to be more easily read from a distance by audience members.",
