  "text": "The name Georg Jensen has been synonymous with 20th century Scandinavian design almost\r\nsince the young Danish silversmith opened the eponymous silversmiths’ atelier and retail\r\nshop in Copenhagen in 1904. Jensen’s first ambition was as a sculptor but, unable to make a\r\nliving in that field, he turned to silver, designing jewelry, tablewares and serving pieces to\r\nwhich he brought the sculptor’s understanding of volume and three-dimensional modeling.",
