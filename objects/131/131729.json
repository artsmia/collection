  "text": "This outer robe for a Ryūkyūan woman was decorated using the ēgata paste-resist technique, which is similar to bingata except that only indigo dye is used, thus making it available to commoners. The limitation of a single color may have made it more difficult to make, forcing the dye artist to rely on shading for variation and distinction between the designs. Given the elaborate stencil work of this robe, it could have belonged to a woman of the warrior class. The stencil work features irises, partly submerged baskets, flowing water, and weeping cherry blossoms, creating the impression of a picturesque, meandering river.",
