  "text": "Technique: Double ikat dye (tate-yoko gasuri)\r\nOkayama Prefecture, part of the Chūgoku region in the southwest of Japan’s main island Honshu, has long been known for the production of cotton fabric dyed with kasuri (ikat) patterns. This length of fabric features vertical stripe patterns (tate-jima) achieved with double ikat (tate-yoko gasuri). Following pattern books, the dyer plots out the areas to be dyed on both warp and weft threads and, using paper and string, masks the parts to remain undyed. Carefully kept in order and position, the threads are dyed, rinsed, and dried before being stretched on the loom. When woven together, the intended patterns emerge. Here, the crosshatch design that looks like a pound sign (#) is meant to mimic the upper frame of a water well (igeta).",
