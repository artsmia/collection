  "text": "Little is known about Lufungula, except that he was active in the 1950s, before the then Belgian Congo gained independence in 1960. When he lived, or when he started and stopped painting, is unknown. He must have been trained in European-style painting, either at an urban art school or at a missionary school in the rural areas. Although the proposed gift shows a typical village scene, so popular among western clients, the artist’s technique and style show personality and originality. Especially the choice of the color palette and the application of thick patches of paint make this an interesting work.",
