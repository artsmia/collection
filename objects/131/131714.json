  "text": "Material and technique: Felted wool and tie-dyeing (shibori)\r\nFelt rugs (mōsen) of this size and shape were often used as a tea service mat (chagujoku) for the senchadō—literally “the way of sencha, ” a ritual using a specific type of loose-leaf green tea. This example is made from felted wool, offering a warm layer on which to sit during winter months. Felting is a process by which heat, friction, and pressure are applied to the wool fibers, causing them to lock together. Comparatively rare in Japan, felted wool was made in China and Mongolia and imported to Japan, where it would be dyed. Here, shibori practices of folding, masking, and tying off areas of cloth prevented certain areas from making contact with the dye. The prepared wool was then dipped in successive dye vats to achieve the desired pattern and hue.",
