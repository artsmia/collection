  "text": "Artists Georgia Speller (born Verges) and Henry Speller met in the early 1960s and married in 1979. According to both of them, they had a marriage that was “just about perfect.” Outside their marriage, however, both felt the social and economic limitations that came with being black in the American South. The fancy house and well-dressed couple in this image speak to Georgia Speller’s dreams of something better. The airplane flying in the sky might signify escape or the high life. But even as she imagines a different life, Speller places the entire scene up on a hill, out of reach.",
