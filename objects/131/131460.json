  "text": "The “Housetop” pattern of concentric rectangles framing a square was uncommon\r\noutside of Gee’s Bend, a rural part of Alabama now well known for its unconventional quilts. Addie Pearl Nicholson made her quilt with nine blocks, but disrupted the pattern by rotating each block in different directions. Nicholson started piecing quilts when she was sixteen. Sometimes, her husband, Daniel, would help her with the piecing and sewing. Together, they would have ten children. While the parents worked in the field, the young children would lay on quilts under the shade of a tree, guarded by their dog.",
