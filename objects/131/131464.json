  "text": "Loretta Pettway is from Gee’s Bend, a rural part of Alabama now well known for its distinctive quilts. When Pettway was young, she learned how to quilt alongside her female elders. She often used the traditional “Bricklayer” pattern, also called “Courthouse Steps, ” distinguished by its repeating stepped pyramid motifs. Pettway distributed green and purple stripes throughout two of her pyramids in an irregular arrangement and used only one strip of blue along the border. Recurring themes in Gee’s Bend quilts are asymmetry and improvisation.",
