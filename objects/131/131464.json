  "text": "Loretta Pettway was from Gee’s Bend, a rural part of Alabama now well known for its unconventional quilts. When Pettway was young, she learned how to quilt alongside her female elders, by cutting fabric and threading needles. By the time she was eleven, she had pieced together and sewn her first quilt. Pettway often used the traditional “Bricklayer” pattern, also called “Courthouse Steps,” piecing together long strips of fabric to create stepped pyramids. Her quilts kept her family warm in a drafty house—she favored this pattern because she dreamed of owning a brick house.",
