  "text": "Material: Ramie from Echigo (Echigo-jōfu)\r\nBast fibers like hemp were frequently used for the clothing of commoners; however, the wealthy also wore bast clothing during the summer months. Called Echigo-jōfu, literally “superior cloth from Echigo, ” garments made from ramie—a form of bast fiber—were extremely fine. The earliest record of ramie fabrics produced in Echigo Province (present-day Niigata Prefecture) in north-central Japan dates from 749; production reached its height in the middle of the Edo period (1603–1868). \r\nRamie is a plant in the nettle family, its fibers twisted into threads before being woven by hand. After dyeing, the wet fabric was stretched across the snow-covered fields for over a week to be “bleached” by the sun and to tighten the weave. To demonstrate the fabric’s fine quality, an ancient test required a 13-inch-wide bolt to be run through the square hole of a coin (less than half an inch).",
