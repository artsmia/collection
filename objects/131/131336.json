  "text": "Celebrated Mexican photographer Graciela Iturbide is known for her groundbreaking documentary work within indigenous communities throughout Mexico. Bringing a feminist lens to her practice, Iturbide has created a large and varied body of work representing a range of traditions, rituals, and everyday experiences relevant to Mexican women and families. Balanced in their composition, playful in subject matter, striking in their tonal range, these photographs stand as prime examples of Iturbide’s talents as photographer and printer.",
