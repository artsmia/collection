  "text": "Uchikui, like furoshiki on mainland Japan, are heavy cloths used for wrapping gifts and other goods. Typical for uchikui, polychromatic designs—in this case of chrysanthemums, peonies, and other florals surrounding a rocky outcrop—are set against a dark indigo ground. Three panels of plain-weave, heavy-grade ramie, a fabric made from the fibers of nettle plants, were joined together. Largescale uchikui woven from stiff and strong fibers were often used to cover furniture or other large household items.",
