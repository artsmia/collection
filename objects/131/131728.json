  "text": "Technique: Patchwork (boro)\r\nOriginally used as a bedding liner (futon-uraji), this textile was sewn to the underside of a bedding cover (futonji), between which cotton batting would have been inserted for insulation. Because such liners were not visible, they were typically made of rewoven fabrics or patchwork (boro) textiles, as is the case here. Most of these patches are made of undyed hemp, but some are also of cotton dyed with indigo.",
