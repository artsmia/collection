  "text": "Mabel Royds went to India in 1914 when her husband, rejected for health reasons by the British Army, wanted to see whether the Indian Army would accept him. (It did.) This is one of several prints inspired by Royds’s time there. The complicated interplay of diagonals—the men’s parallel limbs, the pole slicing through the image, the dramatic angle of the front-facing figure—adds tension to the scene, underscoring the men’s labors.",
