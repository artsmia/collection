  "text": "Material: Safflower dye (beni)\r\nThis kimono, possibly worn by a child, is woven from hemp and dyed a vivid scarlet pink with beni, made from safflower. To create the hue, the dye maker removes the safflower petals from the flowerheads, crushes them, and leaves them to ferment in the vat. In the process, the dyestuff turns from yellow to red. Finally, straw ash is added to extract the red pigment.\r\nThe variable colors of this kimono tell the story of its alterations. A tuck in the body indicates the length was shortened. Meanwhile, the sleeves were lengthened with additional fabric, dyed a more saturated shade of beni.",
