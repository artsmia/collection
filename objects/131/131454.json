  "text": "Look for the yellow-haired rag doll in the upper right of the painting. Arms and legs stretched out, the doll seems to be either flung or in motion. The doll likely represents British royal Princess Diana, whose death in 1997 inspired artist Thornton Dial to make Royal Flag. Dial used twisted bedclothes and rags, shreds of the American flag and pieces of rope, to construct a strangled interpretation of the flag of the United Kingdom. One in a series of seven works, the large-scale assemblage (an artwork made from disparate, often every day, objects) is meant to describe the state of Princess Diana’s world.",
