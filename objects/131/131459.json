  "text": "On April 19, 1995, white supremacist Timothy McVeigh detonated a Ryder rental truck in front of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, killing 168 and injuring 680. This collage is one in a series Ronald Lockett made in response to the terrorist attack. The title, April Nineteenth (The Number), refers to the date of the attack. Alongside the rest of the nation, he likely saw images of the building, sheared nearly in half by the explosion, in newspapers and on TV. Lockett layers fragments of oxidized metal whose sharp edges evoke the physical and emotional devastation of the event, while the rusted cooling element that occupies the center of this piece seems to resemble the open grid of offices exposed by the blast.",
