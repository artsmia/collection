  "text": "Ornamental boxes with compartments, or inro, were typical accessories of a Japanese outfit, commonly used for transporting medicine. The inro dangled from the sash with the aid of a toggle (netsuke) attached by a cord. Carved from wood, this inro has its upper end left raw and uncarved, contrasting dramatically to the regular, intricate surface pattern that covers the rest. The lower jawbone of a bear, its incisors prominently visible, serves as a netsuke.",
