  "text": "Sculptor Harold Tovish (1921–2018) was a figurative modernist, his work rooted in the ideas of cubism and machine-age aesthetics, often with a surrealist twist. His attitude toward the machines that inspired him was not favorable. He feared their destructive capability, which he witnessed first-hand as a soldier during World War II. His perfectionism led him to abandon many projects; so, his output was fairly limited. This portrait is part of a portfolio of seven that Barbara Swan made of artist friends who worked in New England.",
