  "text": "Nahookosji Hai (Winter in the North)/Biboon Giiwedinong (It Is Winter in the North) is a tapestry created by master textile artist DY Begay. In February 2018, Begay traveled to Grand Portage, Minnesota from her home in the Southwest to create a textile inspired by place. Begay’s textiles are abstract paintings on wool, drawn from her keen observations of particular landscapes, particularly within Dine Bikeyah, or Navajo land. In this instance, Begay spent days observing Lake Superior and the winter skies. Begay’s attention to details, of waves crashing on rocks, the light behind trees, and the vast sky helps convey the serenity of the place itself.",
