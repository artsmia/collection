  "text": "The aristocracy used cotton for winter garments. The cut of this garment is typical for Ryūkyūan robes (ryūso): it has sleeves completely attached to the body with triangular gussets under the arms, a long neckband, and is wider and shorter than kimonos from the Japanese mainland. Here, a complex design runs riot over it: maroon-interlocking circles of bamboo, groups of pine boughs and plum blossoms, large stylized snowflakes filled with chrysanthemums, and small ones filled with turtles and cranes, depicted in red.",
