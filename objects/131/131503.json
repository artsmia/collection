  "text": "A headrest is like a pillow, elevating the head and neck during sleep. Headrests are found all over Africa, where they often also protect elaborate hairstyles. The oldest ones were found among other furniture on graves in ancient Egypt and Nubia, while some nomadic pastoralists in eastern Africa still use them today. This example, from central Africa, is particularly attractive because of the two half-figures, looking in opposite directions, that support the top.",
