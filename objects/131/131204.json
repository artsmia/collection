  "text": "The light is fading and the shadows growing long. Birds are in flight, looking for their evening meal. Francis Seymour Haden mad this etching while visiting Cornwallis Maude (1817–1905), then known as the Viscount Hawarden, an Irish aristocrat and conservative politician. His estate was at Dundrum House in Tipperary. Its parkland was considered some of the most beautiful anywhere. The house is now a 3-star hotel and the nearby grounds, a golf course.",
