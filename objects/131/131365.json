  "text": "In this mixed-media multiple, El Anatsui presents a hybrid version of his iconic garment-like woven assemblages composed of discarded liquor bottle caps. In this editioned work, he merges a digital image of a portion of a woven assemblage with a section of actual folded and crumbled aluminum bottle caps attached along one edge. And like the artist’s larger works, the multiple emphasizes the formal characteristics of color, pattern, and harmonized design. The result is a jewel-like surface that invites close inspection and reveals El Anatsui’s innovative transformation of common, discarded materials into objects of beauty and wonder.",
