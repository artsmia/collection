  "text": "Elizabeth Norton’s love of animals dates to her childhood in Chicago, where she spent hours drawing at the Lincoln Park Zoo. The inscription “del., sc. et imp.” stands for delineavit, sculpsit, and impressit—Latin for drawn, carved, and printed. In an era of growing mass production, Norton may have wanted to specify that her woodcuts were original art personally made by her.",
