  "text": "Two turnips arranged in opposite directions decorate this bedding cover, made from five rectangular cotton panels. The cover was likely made for a man as the word for turnips, kabu, is a homonym for kabu o ageru, which means improving one’s reputation. \r\nTo achieve two shades of blue using indigo dye, the dyer required several stages of production. First, the dyer drew the original turnip design using tsutsugaki, a freehand resist-dyeing technique in which starch paste is dripped out of a tube, creating lines. Second, after dyeing the cloth once, he reapplied starch using the same technique, but not in all the same places, resulting in varying depths of blue, light to midnight.",
