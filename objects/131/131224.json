  "text": "Writers in ancient Greece told various versions of the mythical story of the Judgment of Paris. Paris, a mortal, has been called upon to judge a beauty contest between three goddesses: which win the golden orb' Escorted by Hermes, the goddesses try to impress Paris, not just with their beauty but also with other incentives. Hera offered the lands of Europe and Asia. Athena offered military might and wisdom. Aphrodite offered the love of Earth’s most beautiful woman: Helen. Aphrodite won the orb, thus Paris won Helen.",
