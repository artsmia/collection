  "text": "This unlined robe for a woman to wear during the hot summer months was likely created near Arimatsu, a town in present-day Aichi Prefecture famous for its indigo-dyed fabrics. It is decorated with a complex lattice pattern whose regularity was achieved by the use of a stiff paper stencil through which a starchy rice paste was applied. When dry, the paste created a barrier that masked the fabric and kept those areas white once the fabric was submerged in an indigo dyebath.",
