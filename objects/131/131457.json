  "text": "Lonnie B. Holley created Pressure from the Burn as a reminder to persist in the face of hatred and violence against African American people and culture. The fire hose and wood used to fashion this cross came from a railroad bed near Sloss Furnace, in Birmingham, Alabama. In 1993, Holley had made a monumental work called The Goal of Creativity on the site that the city destroyed a year later without warning Holley. When he made this cross, he said, \"Having to put out a fire inside yourself, no matter how bad the blaze you been in, you got to go on carrying your\nburden.\"",
