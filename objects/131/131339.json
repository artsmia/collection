  "text": "David Wojnarowicz’s work documents and illuminates a desperate period of American history: that of the AIDS / HIV crisis and culture wars of the late 1980s and early 1990s. Mexico Crucifix was created during a short but transformative period in the personal and artistic life of the artist. In January 1987 Wajnarowicz had recently returned from Mexico with Tommy Turner where he had shot the majority of the footage for what would become his iconic film, Fire in My Belly. It was during this time Wojnarowicz also learned that his mentor, best friend, and ex-lover Peter Hujar, had been diagnosed with AIDS.\r\n\r\nBetween Coatlicue (Aztec earth goddess) and Christ, Wojnarowicz painted a hurtling steam locomotive, northern Mexican mummies, and a crying child. Covered entirely in plastered Mexican pesos and news articles, this monumental work combines images of religious violence, capitalistic greed, and innovations in media and technology to examine the ways these elements work as one to control and corrupt both the individual and the broader society.",
