  "text": "This print belongs to a long history of images of bathers—though usually these groups of naked people are shown out of the water. This scene of women might be understood as a response to Paul Cézanne’s famous images of male bathers. He originally developed his ideas for this image in the 1920s as a lithograph meant for his series on the theme of misery. Perhaps, these strong women were left without men due to the ravages of the First World War. Such a downbeat interpretation of what might be a lighthearted subject is may be appropriate for the work of the artist whom, in 1938, Time magazine characterized as ‘the somberest painter now alive and the monk of modern art. The heavy black outlines around areas of color harken back to Rouault’s apprenticeship to a stained glass maker in the 1880s.",
