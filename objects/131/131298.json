  "text": "In the late 1960s, Colombian artist Olga de Amaral embarked on a series of radical experiments in weaving, composing monumental sculptures consisting only of warp (vertical) threads using techniques akin to braiding. This body of work became known as her Muros Tejidos (Woven Walls) series. Here, earth tones and a lattice-like structure reference centuries-old Incan slit tapestries, indicating Amaral’s long-term interest in historical Latin American textiles.",
