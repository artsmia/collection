  "text": "A textile made of warm, earth-toned wool and horsehair is radically and experimentally woven in a warp-only style. It hangs just under 10 feet tall, showcasing a unique braiding technique that is almost lattice-like. The braid patterns curve slightly, creating movement. Colors highlighted include a warm, earthy yellow, deep terracotta orange, and browns.",
