  "text": "In the late 1960s Colombian artist Olga de Amaral, embarked on a series of radical experiments in weaving, dropping out the weft and composing monumental warp-only textiles using braiding techniques. This body of work became known as her Muros Tejidos (Woven Walls) series. With this body of work, Amaral moved away from her previous fields of tapestry and designed textiles and came into her own as a conceptual artist. The warm earth tones of this Muro Tejido, along with its lattice-like construction, directly reference archaeological pre-Columbian slit tapestries, and gesture to Amaral’s long-term interest in Latin American historic textiles.",
