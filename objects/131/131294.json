  "text": "Ed Rossbach was an influential member of the blossoming fiber art movement in postwar\r\nCalifornia. In this work he fashioned a c. 1600 collar using a surprising combination of\r\nhistoric lacemaking techniques and modern plastic tubing.\r\nRossbach gravitated to mundane materials and forgotten or overlooked craft techniques. But\r\nhe is best known for his basketry, while lacemaking – historically an overwhelmingly female\r\nand domestic craft - was not an area he often explored. This atypical work therefore\r\nbroadens our view of Rossbach’s efforts to understand and elevate marginalized crafts.",
