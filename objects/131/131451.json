  "text": "In this woodcarving, Leroy Almon shows Jesus with a crown of thorns pricking his forehead, facing the prospect of crucifixion. Almon used a pocketknife to carve the deep wrinkles in Jesus’ forehead and neck, communicating his exhaustion. The directed gaze and set mouth suggest Jesus’ determination and pain in this moment. Almon’s mission as an ordained minister and artist appears in his deeply human portrayal of Jesus. By painting Jesus as black instead of white, Almon created a figure in whom his congregants could see themselves.",
