  "text": "In the early 1980s, self-taught artist John B. Murray received a diagnosis of prostate cancer. Murray had always seen his art as a way to ward off evil. Now that evil had entered his body, his gaze turned to the invisible battle between healthy and contaminated cells inside him. The circle in the lower half of this drawing resembles a prostate gland. Murray colored it with red, perhaps to represent the dangerous cells it contained. Red spreads into the rest of the image, pushing against blue, which represents good in Murray’s work. The pulsing tangle might represent the confusion and distress the disease caused Murray in the final years of his life.",
