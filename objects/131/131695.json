  "text": "This short coat, or hanten, was made of patched pieces of worn cotton—an early form of recycling. The resulting patchwork, known as boro, was then reinforced with even, vertical lines of decorative stitching called sashiko. The extended use of this garment is clearly visible, as is the artistry of the woman, or women, who made and repaired it.",
