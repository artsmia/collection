  "text": "Walking along the shore of Cape Cod or Lake Superior, artist George Morrison would collect pieces of driftwood. At home, he fit the scraps together, allowing the shapes to grow into monumental works that he described as paintings made of wood. In this piece, Morrison arranged long, worn boards to evoke the sea and a horizon line. Throughout the composition, grids of rectangles and squares are interspersed with more organic forms. Curving lines and varied textures in the work call to mind the effect of time and the elements on the land.",
