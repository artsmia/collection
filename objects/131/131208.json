  "text": "Sometimes Francis Seymour Haden shows us places where the railroad was just starting to cause change on the outskirts of London. By 1863, that type of transformation had already been at work in Battersea for 25 years. The lavender fields have been replaced by dense settlement. Despite all the new construction, the steeple of Saint Mary’s Church remains prominent. Though we have a fairly high vantage point, it is nothing like the view that may have wowed the occupants of the distant hot air balloon.",
