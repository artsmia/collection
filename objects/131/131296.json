  "text": "Gibson conceived of this pitcher as the body of a woman with her arms flung behind her and\r\nher torso moving dynamically forward. Titled “Birth of Venus, ” Gibson rendered the form in\r\nsculptural rather than functional terms, working silver as if it were modeling clay and, in so\r\ndoing, brought the goddess of love to life.",
