  "text": "Though it sounds strange today, paper raincoats (kamiko) were popular in premodern Japan for their affordability. They are made of sheets of thick paper sourced from the inner bark of the mulberry plant and treated with persimmon juice and a mixture of oils from perilla seeds and tung (also called China wood). This treatment makes the paper surprisingly resilient and sturdy. The sheets are carefully pasted together, then dyed with indigo. After rubbing the surface to add sheen and create some softness, the maker cuts and sews the cloth into this garment. \r\nAn inscription on the front of the coat might refer to Nishigō-chō 西郷町, a town on Osaka Bay. The name on the front seems to be Hama-Wakabayashi 濱若林 and the roundel on the back reads Hon-Wakabayashi 本若林. Both might belong to a business owned by a person named Wakabayashi. The coat was likely used by the owner or an employee to advertise the business while on the road.",
