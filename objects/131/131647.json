  "text": "Material and technique: Mulberry paper and tie-dyeing (shibori)\r\nThis example of indigo-dyed paper features large circles created by kumo shibori, literally spider tie-dye, a technique that produces the spider web–like circles with radiating lines striped of white. It is a special type of mat (chagujoku or sagujoku) placed underneath tea utensils and charcoal braziers when serving sencha, a loose-leaf green tea, in a ritual (senchadō). Introduced from China by the Zen monk Ingen Ryūki (1592–1673) and popular in Japan by 1800, senchadō is a way of tea appreciation and social activity. During the ritual, the host would lay the utensils on a mat, which functioned not only as protection but also as an object for contemplation.",
