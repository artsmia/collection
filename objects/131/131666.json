  "text": "Dyed an overall shade of light blue, this kimono is decorated with a crest known as mitsu Kashiwa, or three oak leaves, a stylized depiction of a Daimyo oak tree’s leaves, which grow in clusters. Several famous families in Japan’s history used this crest, and the number of veins can vary in each leaf depending on the family. An example of the freehand resist-dyeing technique (tsutsugaki), in which starch paste is applied to the textile from one end of a tube, the crest appears in multiple places on this single garment: in indigo blue on the upper left, in gray on the lower right of the back, and in indigo blue on the lower right of the front.",
