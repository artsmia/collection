  "text": "This vertical landscape came into being as the result of an accident that marred a larger horizontal composition. Haden cut the copper plate and continued to work on the left-hand piece. What had been the periphery now became the center. He created a bit of drama by elaborating the densely wooded riverbanks, allowing them to set off the distant hillside view.",
