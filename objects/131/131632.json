  "text": "Material: Silk pongee (raw silk)\r\nThis kimono is made of tsumugi, or pongee, a soft, thin cloth woven from raw silk. Its threads come from cocoons rejected as inferior by the silk industry due to their irregularity. Making the thread is a time-consuming process: the maker spins the silk floss into yarn by hand, cocoon by cocoon, instead of spinning filaments of several cocoons at once. Because the silk filaments are of uneven width, the woven texture is not shiny and smooth as with most silk. It appears simpler, yet comfortable and light. The more such a garment is washed, stretched, and worn, the more its luster increases.",
