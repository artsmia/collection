  "text": "Artist Joe Minter recalls receiving the inspiration to build his “African Village in America” from God around 1989, the same year his hometown Birmingham, Alabama, began planning a civil rights museum. These three monumental crosses, engineered from found wood, refer to the Christian belief in the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus. Minter used discarded material to combine the Christian resurrection with another kind of resurrection. His was for people the nation had discarded: “That what is invisible, thrown away, could be made into something so it demonstrates that even what gets thrown away, with a spirit in it can survive and grow.”",
