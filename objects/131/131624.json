  "text": "Ainu men were woodcarvers. Used as a cutting tool as well as for defense, knives (makiri) were an essential element of an Ainu man’s outfit. Men carved the sheaths themselves, choosing their own patterns. As a symbol of his carving skills, the knife was suspended prominently from the belt and fastened by a netsuke-like toggle, in this case a piece of deer horn.",
