  "text": "Connecticut-based artist Norma Minkowitz is credited with claiming crochet as a fine art technique. Journey’s End showcases her improvisational crochet methods at their finest. Across the work’s broad expanse, the fiber elements vary in color and thickness. As thread thicknesses change, the quality of the textile evolves, becoming gauzy and transparent in some areas, opaque in others. The resulting sculpture assumes a lifelike, organic quality.",
