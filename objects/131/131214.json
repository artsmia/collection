  "text": "Lucie Stahl utilizes a flatbed scanner to create large-format images in which various objects such as food, photographs, magazine clippings, and trash appear blown-out and flattened. Stahl’s work plays with the notion of liquidity in its many forms—from finance to bodily fluids to the malleability of gender, identity, and images. In Alien Quest, the artist’s hands hold a black and white collaged form with images that speak to conservative family values. Pasted on top of this is a color flyer for a LGBT science fiction novel that calls for the support of marriage equality placing in stark relief the current socio-political climate and one’s aspirations for future possibility.",
