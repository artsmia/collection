  "text": "The opaque red border around the picture makes it feel as though we’re watching the turning of the universe on an old television screen. In this vision, Prophet Royal Robertson maps the universe as a series of concentric circles around God. The white scuffs on the black ground and the varied texture of the rings suggest constant motion. God zips through the center, streaming a comet tail.",
