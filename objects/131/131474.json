  "text": "Artist Georgia Speller often created work on themes of authority, power, and domination. Consider how this composition casts the relationships between these three figures. A man sits, his hands held suggestively in his lap and his gaze directed at the well-defined chest of one of the women. The two women tower over him. One stands back, as if to watch, while the other holds the man by the neck.",
