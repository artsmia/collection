  "text": "This large-scale black chalk drawing represents five men in an interior. Three are over life-sized; they are depicted bust-length with their heads and shoulders extending across the entire sheet of paper, from top to bottom, left to right. Each man is represented from a different point of view. The central figure is shown frontally, and the figures to the left and right are turned in three-quarters view facing away from the center. The men are older, in their seventies, shown with serious expressions and bundled in sweaters, black scarves, rain jackets, and dark fur hats. In the background behind them can be seen two other men, also shown bust-length. Their bodies are not visible behind the large foreground figures but they are similarly dressed. The group of men are depicted in a barely detailed interior, with windows that looks out into a harbor with boats.",
