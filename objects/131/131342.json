  "text": "The Dutch painter, draftsman and printmaker Willem van den Berg dedicated his long, successful career to art of the realist tradition. He specialized in portraits, animal subjects, landscape, and depictions of farmers and fishermen. Over the decades, he frequently returned to the small, conservative, Catholic fishing village of Vollendam, 20 kilometers north of Amsterdam, to depict the Vollendamers, searching to capture their way of life and their weathered faces, old-style costumes, and sober expressions. This monumental drawing is among the largest and most ambitious of van den Berg’s celebrated genre of the Volendam fishermen. The villagers are better known by their nicknames, as many residents share family names. The individuals represented can be identified left to right as Pinkhof, Piet Veerman (1857–1941), also known as “Dikke Piet,” or “Stocky Pete,” and Frerik Schokker (1857–1943), also called “Kleine Frerik,” or “Little Frederick.”",
