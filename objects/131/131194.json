  "text": "The title of this image, Madame est servie, is the French equivalent of saying Dinner is served. German surrealist Paul Wunderlich, here, takes the term more literally, serving up madame on a wooden table. As a painter, sculptor, and printmaker, Wunderlich specialized in erotic, often kinky, imagery. Hs work met mixed reception. He won many awards for the quality of his graphic art, but officials in the early 1960s confiscated his work on the grounds that it was obscene. He frequently fetishized distorted female nudes. His method for morphing them into improbable forms was to draw not his models but their shadows.",
