  "text": "Shards of mirror catch the light and illuminate this colorful scene by Theodore Hill of the Jesus performing his Sermon on the Mount. The sermon is the longest continuous moral teaching by Jesus recorded in the New Testament of the Christian Bible. Here, Jesus seems to float, just barely anchored to the earth. The exuberant yellow ground and fancifully colored rocky outcrops, inhabited my small angels and bushes bearing fruit, seem to set a celebratory tone for the image. Hill made this and other images representing scenes from the life of Jesus to hang in his home in Atlanta, Alabama.",
