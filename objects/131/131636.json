  "text": "A farmer wore this coat to stay warm during the long winter months. It is made of two different cotton weaves: one is a plain-weave dyed with indigo for the side sections and the lower front section of the body, and the other is a double ikat (tate-yoko gasuri) pattern achieved by resist-dyeing sections of both the warp and weft thread prior to weaving, resulting in a pattern that emerges once woven together. While drawing on different techniques to add visual interest, one woven and the other embroidered (sashiko), the maker masterfully combined large panels and strips of the different textiles to create a harmonious and quietly dynamic garment.",
