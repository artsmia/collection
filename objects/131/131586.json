  "text": "Kaparamip are robes made of cotton decorated with a large number of white appliqués in cutout patterns. In the early 17th century, merchants brought cotton cloth to the Ainu, who employed it as a thinner, lighter alternative to traditional materials. Cotton offered Ainu women new aesthetic opportunities, yielding patterns that were more fluid and organic than those found on other types of robes. In both kaparamip shown here, the pieces of white cotton are stitched together to form one large appliqué that covers the entire garment. The sleeve openings and the edges are embellished with pieces of red-dyed cotton, intended to ward off spirits.",
