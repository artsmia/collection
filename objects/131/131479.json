  "text": "Rather than paint Jesus hanging on the cross, Southern artist Mose Tolliver perches birds upon it. In many of Tolliver’s works, perhaps drawing on imagery from African-American folk tales, birds represent freedom and transcendence. Tolliver first started working with wood after seeing a neighbor make sculptures out of tree roots. He soon began making paintings—usually with limited color palettes like the red, blue, and white of this work. In Christianity, the cross represents the\nweight of human sin. This red cross, however, seems to float on the blue background, buoyed visually by the contrasting colors and physically by the head of the white figure.",
