  "text": "The artist of this work, John B. Murray, barely went to school and never learned how to read. Beginning in 1978, however, the script seen here began appearing in his paintings. Murray started drawing amoebic, biological forms like these after being diagnosed with prostate cancer in the early 1980s. The red and grey in the shapes to the right might represent cancerous infection. Perhaps Murray wrote a protective charm or benediction in the blue inscription to the left, intended to ward off further infection.",
