  "text": "This is a slightly reduced copy of an etching made by Francis Seymour Haden in 1870. Apart from this print, we know nothing of the copyist, who signed “A. Barry.” The Agamemnon was one of the last wooden-hulled war ships built in England. The Keel was laid in 1849, and the ship launched in 1852. Armed with 91 guns, it served as the flagship in many battles. In 1857, it helped to lay the transatlantic telegraph cable. It is shown here during its demolition at the Navel Arsenal at Deptford. In the distance at left is the Royal Hospital at Greenwich and the “Dreadnought,” an old ship that served at the Battle of Trafalgar and subsequently as a hospital ship.",
