  "text": "This banner is decorated with a hand-painted scene of four samurai sitting on the ground carrying various weapons. The figure in front holds an iron folding fan (tessen) used to signal commands and, at close quarters, ward off an attack or be used as a blunt instrument. Beside him sits a warrior with a tall, cross-shaped spear (jūmonji yari) that extends almost to the top of the banner. The topmost figure holds a matchlock rifle. It is unclear which scene in Japanese folklore this scene references.",
