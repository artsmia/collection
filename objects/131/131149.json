  "text": "This tapestry was designed to hang in Case Western Reserve Law School’s moot courtroom, a space where law students practiced arguing in court. Because the tapestry was meant to hang in front of a chalkboard, Helena Hernmarck divided it into two panels that would slide right and left whenever one needed to access the board. Hernmarck’s design includes imagery that references the U.S. legal system, including a scale of justice and the Great Seal of the United States.",
