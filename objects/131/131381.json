  "text": "The brooding paintings and drawings by Arthur Polonsky (born 1925) feature exquisitely calculated draftsmanship combined with furiously expressive gestures. His studies of the human condition can be solidly grounded in reality or sail away into flights of magical mysticism. This portrait is part of a portfolio of seven that Barbara Swan made of artist friends who worked in New England.",
