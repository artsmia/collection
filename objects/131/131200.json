  "text": "Francis Seymour Haden’s landscapes recorded many places that were just on the verge of major change. To the right, the railroad has penetrated a quiet riverside retreat. The train came here, to Brentford, largely to serve Kew, which lay across the River Thames and was home to the Royal Botanic Gardens and posh suburban homes. Haden’s vantage point seems to be in Kew. Though Kew retains much of its open green space, Brentford is much more heavily built up in part due to its direct access to transportation.",
