  "text": "Nellie Mae Abrams was born in 1946 in Gee’s Bend. She and her mother developed\r\ntheir distinctive quilting styles in a broader community of artists who lived and worked in\r\nGee’s Bend, a rural community in Alabama now known for its inventive quilting style.\r\nNellie Mae Abrams started her “Housetop” quilt with a solid block of blue fabric. She joined\r\nyellow strips of fabric on two sides of the square, and continued adding strips around that\r\noriginal block until she declared the quilt complete. The loose pattern of dancing squares\r\nmade room for unexpected compositional choices, like the red striped cloth in the border of this quilt.",
