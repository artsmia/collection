  "text": "Nellie Mae Abrams was born in 1946 in Gee’s Bend. She and her mother developed their distinctive quilting styles in a broader community of artists who lived and worked in Gee’s Bend, a rural community in Alabama now known for its inventive quilting style. Nellie Mae Abrams started her “Housetop” quilt with a solid block of blue fabric. She joined yellow strips of fabric on two sides of the square, and continued adding strips around that original block until she declared the quilt complete. The loose pattern of dancing squares made room for unexpected compositional choices, like the red striped cloth in the border of this quilt.",
