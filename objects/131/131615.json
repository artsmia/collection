  "text": "In temperate weather, Ainu typically went barefoot. Footwear was used for hunting on snow and ice. From late autumn to early summer, the Sakhalin Ainu hunted seals for fur, meat, and oil. This pair of boots is made of sealskin sewn together with animal sinew. Light, hard-wearing, and water-resistant, sealskin was an ideal material whose popularity and utility were shared by other Pacific Rim cultures, including the Nivkh of Siberia and the Inuit of North America.",
