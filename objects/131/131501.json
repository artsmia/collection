  "text": "Roy De Forest considered his work to be play. He had a keen sense of humor and affection for animals (especially dogs) that is evident in the subject matter and energy of his work. This construction, made early in his career, shows his inventive reflection on landscape and memory. The entire piece looks like ot could be a music box or wind-up toy (notice the mechanism on the left side waiting to be turned). Vivid color and suggestive details in wood let the viewer's imagination go wild.",
