  "text": "Chijiri is a general term used for Ainu garments that are directly embroidered without appliqué. Absent the added layer of appliquéd cloth, the embroidery must stand on its own, demanding perfection. Ainu women selected thread colors, such as yellow, to contrast with, while also complement, the rich tones of these robes. They also considered various types of stitchwork—here, chain and couch—for the distinct visual qualities they offered. and then rendered stitches that are precise, small, and uniform.",
