  "text": "If you think that the face of this Igbudu mask looks ugly, you’re not alone. Its Yoruba users in Nigeria have an expression to describe an especially homely person: “O l’oju bi oju ‘gbudu”—\"His eyes are like the eyes of Igbudu.” The mask, with its dirty face and misshapen features, is compared to Eshu, the Yoruba god of chaos, and the dancer who wears it on top of his head carries a stick to strike out against onlookers. The ceremony in which Igbudu performs is an important one: called Egungun, and celebrated once a year in every Yoruba community, it remembers and honors the ancestors.",
