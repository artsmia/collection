  "text": "Draftsman, painter, and printmaker, Bernard Chaet (1924–2012) taught for 40 years at Yale University. His landscapes and still lifes are full of the energy, emotion, and occasionally violence that one would expect of a scene of a football game or a battle. This portrait is part of a portfolio of seven that Barbara Swan made of artist friends who worked in New England.",
