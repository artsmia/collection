This is a quiet follow up to yesterday’s Report. Materializing the turning point, a choice, decision. How do you know what is right? So many aspects of our lives had been turned upside down, perverted or completely demolished in the recent years. It’s hard to find a solid footing anywhere. And yet, so much depends on our ability to, indeed, do the right thing.</i>",
