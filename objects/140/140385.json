  "text": "This artwork is part of the series COVID-19: Labor Camp Report.   \r\n\r\nArtist's statement on this artwork originally published on the @laborcamp Instagram account: \r\n\r\nTwo stories merging in this report: 1: Russia announced that they have the COVID-19 vaccine, despite the fact that there was clearly not enough time to test it. 2: German authorities confirmed today that Alexey Navalny, an outspoken Putin critic, was poisoned with Novichok [Новичо́ к]: chemical nerve agent developed and used by the Russian state. Let’s all hope that our Regime does not get inspired by these Russian strategies that “make things go away.”",
