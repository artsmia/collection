  "text": "This artwork is part of the series COVID-19: Labor Camp Report.   \r\n\r\nArtist's statement on this artwork originally published on the @laborcamp Instagram account: \r\n\r\n<i>Racist hatred and disregard for Black Lives manifests itself in many different ways, enabled and cultivated by mechanisms of oppression and discrimination. It has persisted throughout  American history, and continues today, maintaining its hold on systemic structures. Those are the facts, and no amount of “patriotic education” can erase this ugly truth.</i>",
