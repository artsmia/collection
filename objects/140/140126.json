  "text": "The Romantic movement led to renewed appreciation for buildings surviving from the Middle Ages and for the beauty of mans coexistence with nature. Both of these strands are found in Domenico Quaglio's poetic study of Boppart, a small town along the Rhine River, now known as Boppard and now designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Gothic building at the right is a 13th-century parrish church. Quaglio presents us with an idyllic world in which gnarled oak tree, a pleasant stream and ancient buildings provide a safe and peaceful environment for the townspeople.",
