  "text": "Itaya Hazan first became interested in ceramics as a child; he was particularly fascinated by the tea bowls his father used in the Japanese tea ceremony. He studied sculpture at the Tokyo Fine Arts School (the university did not offer ceramics courses at the time), and after college he established his own kiln and won accolades for his works. In 1953, Itaya became the first ceramicist to receive the Order of Culture. He was also nominated as a Living National Treasure in 1960 but declined the honor.\r\nItaya developed an underglazing technique called hokō, which means “enveloping the light.” Here, the hokō matte glaze endows the Kannon with a mellow radiance, as if it glowed from within. The realistic representation of the drapery underscores Itaya’s training in sculpture.",
