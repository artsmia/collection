  "text": "This artwork is part of the series COVID-19: Labor Camp Report.   \r\n\r\nArtist's statement on this artwork originally published on the @laborcamp Instagram account: \r\n\r\n<i>I read somewhere that there might never be an end to this pandemic. That the antibodies don’t last, that the virus mutates, that people will not take the vaccine. As a father, and a teacher, I am also wondering how are folks preparing their kids to enter the virus laden schools?</i>",
