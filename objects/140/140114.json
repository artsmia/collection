  "text": "Adrien de Witte was one of the most respected artists of Liège in Belgium. As a young man he spent five years in Rome, where he resided at the Darchis Foundation, an institution founded in 1699 for the purpose of supporting young men from Liège in their efforts to study art and theology in Rome. He returned to Liège where he was appointed professor at the Academy of Fine Arts in 1885 and taught there until 1921. He was director of the Academy from 1910 to 1913.\r\n\r\nProsper Drion (1822-1906) was a sculptor from Liege. He preceded de Witte as director of the Academy of Fine Arts, a post he held for 23 years.",
