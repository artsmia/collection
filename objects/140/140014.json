  "text": "Alexandra Kehayoglou creates lifelike three-dimensional textiles that depict her native Argentine landscape. \"No Longer Creek\" marked a turning point in the artist’s career when she made advocating for the environment a priority in her practice. After witnessing the daily gradual destruction of Raggio Creek, a river near her home in Buenos Aires that was being choked and polluted by industrial activity, she conceived of this work as a cry for help. Kehayoglou’s plea for public attention along with broader community-led efforts ultimately saved Raggio Creek, and the habitat was later restored to its natural state. \r\n\r\nKehayoglou comes from an Argentine family of Greek descent. She laboriously handcrafts her textiles using natural wool fibers reclaimed from her family’s 60-year old carpet factory.",
