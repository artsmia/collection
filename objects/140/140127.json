  "text": "In the 1960s, likely inspired by early historic examples, Kamoda experimented with ash glazes, which tend to pool when fired—a quality that puts more emphasis on the glazed vessel’s surface texture. Here, the glaze liquified and ran in rivulets down the vertical sides of the vase. Nearly transparent, the glaze’s greenish color is noticeable where it is slightly thicker. Japanese potters first applied such ash glazes to their wares as early as the 800s. Kamoda’s ash-glazed pieces garnered him critical recognition, and in 1965 he won the Japan Ceramics Society Award.",
