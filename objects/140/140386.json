  "text": "This artwork is part of the series COVID-19: Labor Camp Report.   \r\n\r\nArtist's statement on this artwork originally published on the @laborcamp Instagram account: \r\n\r\n<i>The Regime is desperate to divert the attention away from their disastrous mishandling of the pandemic which continues to kill thousands of Americans. The world’s largest weapons manufacturer, exporter of death, complains about the dangers posed by cans of soup. It would be just funny, if it were not yet another nudge pushing the country into free fall towards fascist dictatorship.</i>",
