  "text": "Nancy Spero was a lifelong activist and was horrified by the U.S. air war in Vietnam. News about the war affected her so that she radically shifted her approach to art so that she could work fast, on paper, and with easily obtained materials. This intimacy and immediacy is evident in this drawing that imagines a weapon of war -- the armed helicopter -- being chased away by an image of a mother and nursing child, accompanied by the word Peace stenciled twice.",
