  "text": "This artwork is part of the series COVID-19: Labor Camp Report.   \r\n\r\nArtist's statement on this artwork originally published on the @laborcamp Instagram account: \r\n\r\n<i>There is an incomprehensible quality about the numbers I hear or read about, no matter the context. Whether it’s wealth or misery, the abstraction engulfs the reality. Except perhaps for the faint realization, that some of them belong in one world, and others in a completely different one.</i>",
