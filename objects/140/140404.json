  "text": "This artwork is part of the series COVID-19: Labor Camp Report.   \r\n\r\nArtist's statement on this artwork originally published on the @laborcamp Instagram account: \r\n\r\n<i>The Justice Department declared Seattle, Portland and New York City “anarchist jurisdictions” as a basis for denying federal support to those cities. It’s unbelievable, AND decidedly pathetic for the government to assault major American cities, and its citizens, this way. It’s as if the Regime is at war with its own citizenry...</i>",
