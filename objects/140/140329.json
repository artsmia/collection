  "text": "This artwork is part of the series COVID-19: Labor Camp Report.   \r\n\r\nArtist's statement on this artwork originally published on the @laborcamp Instagram account: \r\n\r\n<i>No matter if you live in a state that is currently experiencing a massive surge of COVID-19 infections, or in one that appears to have it under control, it seems that we are all trapped in ultra polarized spaces. Spaces defined by the profound inability to ascertain with any degree of confidence, what is actually happening. I feel these divisions eating away at my discombobulated brain. Who/what can i trust? What does it all mean? Where are we going?</i>",
