  "text": "A woman seated in an armchair holds a child in her lap. The woman wears a shawl and has her hair in a bun. Light flows in through a window behind the chair. The woman's face is in shadow, and the child's is brightly lit. Could this be a meditation on two lives, one coming to a close, the other just beginning'\r\n\r\nAdrien de Witte was one of the most respected artists of Liège in Belgium. As a young man he spent five years in Rome, where he resided at the Darchis Foundation, an institution founded in 1699 for the purpose of supporting young men from Liège in their efforts to study art and theology in Rome. He returned to Liège where he was appointed professor at the Academy of Fine Arts in 1885 and taught there until 1921. He was director of the Academy from 1910 to 1913.",
