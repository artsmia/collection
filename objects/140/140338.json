The Regime hides pandemic data from the public, in order to sow further disinformation.\r\n\r\nDistrust of science is fomented, while magical thinking proliferates. People furiously argue about the validity of basic protections afforded by wearing a mask... It’s hard not to think that the fog of war had descended upon us. The fog of pandemic. The fog of now.",
