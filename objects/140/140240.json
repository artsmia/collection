Change is coming! From anguish comes hope. From devastation comes renewal. From death springs life. Contemplating ways to turn the tragedy into opportunity. Subvert its destructive energy, and allow it to propel us forward into a better future. A companion to the “No!” Report from April 7, reminding us that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.</i>",
