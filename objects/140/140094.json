  "text": "A five-breasted naked woman labeled \"Natura\" hands a naked baby to a woman in a long dress with her right breast exposed. Paint has been applied these two figures to cover exposed parts of their bodies. To the right is another woman who carries a swaddled baby. In the background are many animals on land, sea, and air. Especially prominent are to boars, a salamander, a hedgehog, a turtle, a bear, and a chicken.\r\n\r\nThis is the first print in a series of six that studies the misery of human life. The images were designed by Maarten van Heemskerck and engraved by Philips Galle. Each is accompanied by Latin verses by the learned Dutch polymath Hadrianus Junius (1511-1575), with further verses in French and Dutch below.\r\n\r\nSome of the verses below may be roughly translated as follows:\r\nBirds, fish, trees, and all animals,\r\nAre all provided and clothed by Nature.\r\nMan alone is left completely naked,\r\nand suffers a thousand travails.",
