  "text": "This artwork is part of the series COVID-19: Labor Camp Report.   \r\n\r\nArtist's statement on this artwork originally published on the @laborcamp Instagram account: \r\n\r\n<i>Do you ever get the feeling that reality has spun out of control to the point where seemingly immutable, fundamental concepts become unstable, even questionable? For example: what if freedom doesn’t really exist, and the idea of it was only invented to justify oppression? I was thinking today about the overwhelming noise of the world. And the yearning for silence. Silence is complicated. Silence is death. But silence also helps us turn inward, to dig deeper, to find empathy. Is there a loud silence...?</i>",
