  "text": "The action takes place outdoors. Three men huddle closely together playing cards. They use blocks of stone for benches. One sits with his back to us and wears a tall hat with a wide brim. Behind his is another man who wears a tall hat without a brim. A third player wears no hat. Behind him is another man who looks too drunk to play. In the background is a large building with weeds growing from the weathered masonry. This architecture suggests that Thomas Wijk may have made this etching about the time of his sojourn in Italy (in Naples and perhaps Rome), 1640-42.",
