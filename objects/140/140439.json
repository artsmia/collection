  "text": "This artwork is part of the series COVID-19: Labor Camp Report.   \r\n\r\nArtist's statement on this artwork originally published on the @laborcamp Instagram account: \r\n\r\n<i>Another police murder, this time in Philadelphia, hundreds of thousands dead from COVID, disease spreading faster than ever, billionaires profiting from our misery, and the Regime found yet another way to corrupt and pervert justice. Hypocrisy and cruelty both are at play in the Supreme Court confirmation last night. An assault that is carefully calibrated to inflict maximum, long term damage to our democracy, and personal freedoms and liberties.</i>",
