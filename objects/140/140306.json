  "text": "This artwork is part of the series COVID-19: Labor Camp Report.   \r\n\r\nArtist's statement on this artwork originally published on the @laborcamp Instagram account: \r\n\r\n<i>I read today Chomsky saying that the Regime “has adopted the ‘Viva Death!’ approach.” While I can see that the Regime will choose death for profit any time, I do not understand why people decided that the disease no longer concerns them. Wear your mask! If you don’t want to do it for yourself or for those around you, do it against the Regime.</i>",
