Ultimate excuse for inconvenient truth. I watched the Attorney General hearings yesterday, and was struck how often those exercising their right to protest are labeled terrorists, while the criminal Regime hides behind the pretense of patriotism. What if patriotism is just nationalism “lite”' And nationalism, just a more palatable version of fascism'",
