  "text": "This artwork is part of the series COVID-19: Labor Camp Report.   \r\n\r\nArtist's statement on this artwork originally published on the @laborcamp Instagram account: \r\n\r\n<i>The Regime’s favorite word. Ultimate excuse for inconvenient truth. I watched the Attorney General hearings yesterday, and was struck how often those exercising their right to protest are labeled terrorists, while the criminal Regime hides behind the pretense of patriotism. What if patriotism is just nationalism “lite”? And nationalism, just a more palatable version of fascism?</i>",
