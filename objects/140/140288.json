  "text": "This artwork is part of the series COVID-19: Labor Camp Report.   \r\n\r\nArtist's statement on this artwork originally published on the @laborcamp Instagram account: \r\n\r\n<i>The fact that even during the pandemic, as a People, we need to fight against the deadly grip of racist, systemic injustice is a testimony to our social failure. There is a rotten, morally debased culture that is eating away at whatever is left of our collective identity. I believe though, that the plague does bring an opportunity to renew our commitment to empathy. And that if we work hard together, we can lay foundation for a healthier, more equitable, and just future. Black Lives Matter. Enough is enough.</i>",
