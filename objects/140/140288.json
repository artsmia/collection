There is a rotten, morally debased culture that is eating away at whatever is left of our collective identity. I believe though, that the plague does bring an opportunity to renew our commitment to empathy. And that if we work hard together, we can lay foundation for a healthier, more equitable, and just future. Black Lives Matter. Enough is enough.",
