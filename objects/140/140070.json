  "text": "An adolescent putto stands in a shaft of bright light, leaning against an upright cornucopia that brims with a scepter, a palm frond, a laurel wreath, a chain bearing medals, etc. With his left hand, he points to a pile of books. This is an allegory of the rewards of study. The message is that if  one is lluminated through education, one can achieve, fame, power, glory, and wealth.\r\n\r\nThis comes a series of playful images of putti etched by Lorenzo Loli after drawings by Giovanni Andrea Sirani.",
