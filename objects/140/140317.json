Later, as my city burned, the fire became a very real presence in the landscape of the uprising. Today, I am thinking of the flames of distrust and hatred stoked by the Regime. The lines of division. They are describing massive infection outbreaks as “hot spots,” but fires burn bright between each and every one of us.",
