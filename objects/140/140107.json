  "text": "This Christian allegory is a two part scene with the interior of a Jewish temple at the left and the exterior at the right. Inside a priest stands in the bimah using a pointer to lead the assembled congregation through the texts, presumably the Tem Commandments, inscribed on tablets. In the forground, an elaborately dressed woman sits on a throne. She probably represents Faith. Outside stands Jesus. He holds a large cross and has nail wounds from his crucifixion. He puts his right hand through a small window, drawing the attention of the seated woman, thus suggesting another way besides Jewish tradition.",
