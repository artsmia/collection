  "text": "This artwork is part of the series COVID-19: Labor Camp Report.   \r\n\r\nArtist's statement on this artwork originally published on the @laborcamp Instagram account: \r\n\r\n<i>By Regime’s own admission: the virus spreads through air, and is exponentially more deadly  than even the worst flu. 198, 452 people died from it in the USA alone. And yet, there are thousands, if not millions of folks here, who choose to live in a world of fiction, in which none of this is happening. Science fiction offered a vision of the world built on science, but we appear to be living in a world governed by fiction and denying science.</i>",
