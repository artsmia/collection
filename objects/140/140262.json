  "text": "This artwork is part of the series COVID-19: Labor Camp Report.   \r\n\r\nArtist's statement on this artwork originally published on the @laborcamp Instagram account: \r\n\r\nNearly 3,000 people died of COVID-19 on Friday. We often use 9/11 as a sort of national grief reference point. So the realization that we now have entered a stage, at which we relive the tragedy of this magnitude daily, helps to put things in context. The heavy silence present in images from that day was resonating in my mind as I drew these figures. One by one.",
