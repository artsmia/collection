  "text": "This artwork is part of the series COVID-19: Labor Camp Report.   \r\n\r\nArtist's statement on this artwork originally published on the @laborcamp Instagram account: \r\n\r\n<i>Taking a moment today to acknowledge the crazy amount of time that had passed since it all began. This week marked half a year since I started making these drawings every day. 6 months, and just about everything feels out of control. Uncontained. Maybe uncontainable. And also hair.\r\n\r\nP.S.\r\nI am not sure how this came about, but when thinking about the lockdown duration, I got this image in my head: a figure lost in, or swallowed by the wild, swirling hair that becomes this dark torrent. I guess for many of us, the uncut hair became a tangible measure of the flow of time. For me, all days became somewhat similar. I certainly lost the sense of weekdays or weekends.\r\n\r\nPerhaps time did become the tangle of a thousand strands? An all enveloping braid. When I started on this series, I cracked open a fresh packet of coffee filters. Watching the pack of 100 disappear, and then another, became another metric for me. This Thursday, I opened the fifth pack... I drank more than 400 cups of coffee while drawing. Maybe it’s not hair? Maybe the figure is just drowning in coffee?</i>",
