  "text": "This artwork is part of the series COVID-19: Labor Camp Report.   \r\n\r\nArtist's statement on this artwork originally published on the @laborcamp Instagram account: \r\n\r\n<i>It’s no wonder that the Regime luxuriates in genocidal catastrophe. Its totalitarian language and behavior betrays the true agenda with renewed clarity. From dog whistles to overt fascist signaling. From racist heritage to heartless policy. No amount of flowery decorum can cover the stench of hate and violence fomented by the Regime in the name of Freedom and Liberty. And how pathetic, that when called out, they hide behind a childish excuse: it was just a joke.</i>",
