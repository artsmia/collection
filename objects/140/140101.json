  "text": "The action takes place outdoors amid ruinous ancient Roman buildings. It appears to be the end of a workday. The shadows are growing long, and three men play cards as others look on. Thomas Wijk may have made this etching about the time of his sojourn in Italy (in Naples and perhaps Rome), 1640-42, or it could be a memory of his experiences there.",
