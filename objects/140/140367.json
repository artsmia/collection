  "text": "This artwork is part of the series COVID-19: Labor Camp Report.   \r\n\r\nArtist's statement on this artwork originally published on the @laborcamp Instagram account: \r\n\r\n<i>3 things intersect here for me: 1. Decline in testing in the US means we will simply “see” less, and certainly understand less the extent of the problem. 2. Months into the plague we seem to notice it less, act like it’s not really happening. 3. The creeping in of the fascist, dictatorial dynamic in our country is evident, yet there does not appear to be a way to stop it. Things happen right in front of us, but a sense of our collective inability to see them is overwhelming.</i>",
