  "text": "This artwork is part of the series COVID-19: Labor Camp Report.   \r\n\r\nArtist's statement on this artwork originally published on the @laborcamp Instagram account: \r\n\r\n<i>These particular numbers are based on the distribution of wealth in the US (with only 7% of wealth being held by 80% of the entire population), but it really could have been any numbers. The Report is about how much our understanding of the various deep predicaments is totally opaque to us. How the numbers continue to resemble less and less of the reality in our country, which, of course, is profoundly broken.</i>",
