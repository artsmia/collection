  "text": "This artwork is part of the series COVID-19: Labor Camp Report.   \r\n\r\nArtist's statement on this artwork originally published on the @laborcamp Instagram account: \r\n\r\n<i>The constant arguments about masks are absurd. They are there to protect us, and those around us. Every time I put mine on, I think of the bravery and selflessness of the thousands of doctors and nurses, who put their PPE on to care for us. Day in, day out. Wear it. Save a life.</i>",
