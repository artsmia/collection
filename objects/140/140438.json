  "text": "This artwork is part of the series COVID-19: Labor Camp Report.   \r\n\r\nArtist's statement on this artwork originally published on the @laborcamp Instagram account: \r\n\r\n<i>The two stories today that blended together in this drawing for me: the third, out of control surge of COVID, and the methodical push to appoint the backward judge to the Supreme Court. The feeling is that we are sitting on the edge of a full blown disaster, powerlessly watching it happen. Do you feel this dread too? How much more of it can we take?</i>",
