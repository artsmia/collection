  "text": "This artwork is part of the series COVID-19: Labor Camp Report.   \r\n\r\nArtist's statement on this artwork originally published on the @laborcamp Instagram account: \r\n\r\n<i>Many things converge, for me, in this meat still life: 1. I began with the reports of the regime ordering the meat plants to continue their operation, despite thousands of cases of employees and meat inspectors being diagnosed with the deadly disease. 2. Further, in general, acknowledging the gross mismanagement of food resources leading to tons of vegetables being buried, thousands of gallons of milk being wasted, while millions of people line up in food lines because they can’t afford the next meal. 3. Realizing yet another opportunity brought to us by the pandemic: to re-evaluate our cruelty laden addiction to meat, which coincidentally, significantly contributes to the ongoing environmental disaster. 4. Remembering, that in Polish “still life” [martwa natura] literally means “dead nature.” 5. Wishing good luck to us all [see above].</i>",
