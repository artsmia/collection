  "text": "This artwork is part of the series COVID-19: Labor Camp Report.   \r\n\r\nArtist's statement on this artwork originally published on the @laborcamp Instagram account: \r\n\r\n<i>This is a hard one. It’s not too late, but it sure feels that what we have at the moment is merely an illusion of democracy. Pandemic revealed the severity of the systematic dismantling and  ruination of our democratic institutions. Racism, hatred, nationalism, and lies, are merely financial instruments in the hands of the ruling class. When they are done with us, we will be either literally or morally bankrupt. Or both.</i>",
