  "text": "This artwork is part of the series COVID-19: Labor Camp Report.   \r\n\r\nArtist's statement on this artwork originally published on the @laborcamp Instagram account: \r\n\r\n<i>Our home has been mangled beyond recognition. Our more perfect union deformed and abused. Despite, or perhaps because of it all, we must work together to build a way forward. To paraphrase the great Ruth Bader Ginsburg: “We must do something outside ourselves, something to repair tears in our community, something to make life a little better for people less fortunate than us.”</i>",
