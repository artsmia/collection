  "text": "This artwork is part of the series COVID-19: Labor Camp Report.   \r\n\r\nArtist's statement on this artwork originally published on the @laborcamp Instagram account: \r\n\r\n<i>The official death toll in the U.S. is nearly 60, 000 and there are now over 1, 000, 000 cases of people diagnosed with the disease here. I read stories about the hospital workers holding up cellphones so their patients can say goodbye to loved ones. So much of the death is experienced through our phones. The ultimate corporeal experience of the human condition, reduced to a touch of a perfectly machined, glass surface.</i>",
