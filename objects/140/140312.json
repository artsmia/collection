  "text": "This artwork is part of the series COVID-19: Labor Camp Report.   \r\n\r\nArtist's statement on this artwork originally published on the @laborcamp Instagram account: \r\n\r\n<i>There is of course the childish notion, that if you just close your eyes, it all goes away, that our Regime embraces. Then there is the idea of history that is constantly manipulated, and because of that, in truth, entirely inaccessible. But there is also the fact, that we are witnessing this historic moment, and that we must not let our experiences slip into the oblivion of time. And more.</i>",
