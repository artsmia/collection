  "text": "Valeska Soares is a Brazilian-based conceptual artist whose wide-ranging practice encompasses sculpture, assemblage, installation art, collage, drawing, photography, and video. Found and repurposed material are the focus of her innovative practice. Soares’ collage, For To (XI), is part of a series of works featuring dedication pages torn from various antique books and arranged into distinctive geometric formations. Soares regularly uses found books and parts of books to explore the subjective constructs of experience and consciousness, especially the ever-shifting perceptions of time, space, and memory. In this presentation, Soares massed dedication pages into two panels that together form a distinct oval shape. The pages offer a glimpse of the preserved but mostly forgotten personal histories of the authors and gift givers, whose inscriptions tell of love, gratitude, honor, and admiration. Evoking nostalgia, intimacy, and the transience of time, Soares’ collage reveals her fascination with, in her own words, “the lives and memories [of others], becoming for a moment in time, part of those personal narratives as each one travels from subject to subject.”",
