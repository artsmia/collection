  "text": "This artwork is part of the series COVID-19: Labor Camp Report.   \r\n\r\nArtist's statement on this artwork originally published on the @laborcamp Instagram account: \r\n\r\n<i>The questions of “when will the project end?” or “how many Reports will be made?” were present for me from the very first week of the process, back in March. At first, I thought I would just make them until I run out of paper, or ink. Then folks came forward with offers to send me paper and found ink for me to keep going. Then, I thought, perhaps a month, or two, or three? As weeks rolled on, I have been looking for a “sign, ” a moment in time that would make it clear that the project is over. A meaningful closure.\r\n+\r\nThat moment is here, and the COVID-19: Labor Camp Report Project comes to an end.\r\n+\r\nAs a nation we arrive at the precipice today, on November 3rd. A pivot, crucial juncture, a fork in the road, point of no return. What happens next begins the new chapter in the book of events. A book always opened in the middle. Looking out into, and beyond the scorched landscape, I feel hesitant and hopeful. Bewildered and frightened. Determined and emboldened. But also exhausted and deeply injured by the dark times we have endured together. My thoughts go toward healing and rebuilding.\r\n+\r\nPersonally, after more than a thousand hours spent at the desk drawing every day, after 225 Reports, I will take a moment to regroup. The scope, and various outputs of the Report Project itself will require my attention in the coming months. There are exhibitions in the works, I will finally have the time to organize the printing of all the posters, and make them available as individual prints (so many of you requested this, that I feel I absolutely have to make it happen!) And, of course, there is the book that Frank and I have been working on, which is scheduled to come out in early 2021!\r\n+\r\nThere are no words, with which I can adequately express my gratitude to all of you who joined me on this journey. Your sustained attention, countless conversations, words of encouragement and sharing motivated me to stay present and witness, working daily for more than 7 months. There is a real sense of community that emerged around this work: from the thousands engaging through social media, to hundreds who supported the Project so generously via Kickstarter, to scores who came forward volunteering to wheat paste prints in Minneapolis, Saint Paul, Rochester, Baltimore, New York, Los Angeles, and Portland.\r\n+\r\nI am filled with love and gratitude for my Quarantine Family, who supported me in this crazy adventure in so many ways: sustaining me emotionally, but also made sure that I never ran out of materials and supplies (special shoutout to Pamela: my official liaison extraordinaire with Wet Paint in Saint Paul!), that the hundreds of cups of coffee kept coming, that there was always time in the schedule to make the drawing each and every day. And Ava, who held every single drawing for the front porch photo: a weird new ritual we performed together for months without break. I am humbled by it all, exhausted and exhilarated.\r\n+\r\nWhile the Report Project is over, I am motivated and inspired to continue producing and sharing new work. After all, at the Labor Camp, We Are Working All The Time! Stay tuned. Stay strong. I will see you on the other side of today!\r\n+\r\nMuch love, p.</i>",
