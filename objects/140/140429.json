Then came the second wave. Now, we are entering the third peak stage in the continually expanding pandemic disaster. It is painfully clear that whatever it is we are doing, is not working. If we are going to save ourselves, we need a new direction, a new plan. The Regime doesn’t care about us. We need to vote them out.",
