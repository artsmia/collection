But we know that today is merely a cruel reenactment of the fascist past. The ruling class in the US metastasized over the governing body and mutated into an autocratic Regime. Complete with fanatical fervor, militaristic forces brutalizing the citizenry, demonization of free press, and thousands dying at the hands of a heartless tyrant. We are trapped in a cruel Gordian knot of time space continuum.",
