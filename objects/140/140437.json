The catastrophic mishandling of the pandemic makes it clear just how grave is the importance of your vote. The survival of democracy is on the ballot. So is the question of how many more thousands of American lives will be lost to this disease, and whether we will be able to meaningfully care for millions of the sick. Defend yourself! Defend your  loved ones. Vote now if you can, or vote November 3!</i>",
