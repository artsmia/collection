  "text": "This artwork is part of the series COVID-19: Labor Camp Report.   \r\n\r\nArtist's statement on this artwork originally published on the @laborcamp Instagram account: \r\n\r\n<i>So many ideas cross over every time our “fearless leader” uses the childish excuse of “there are 19 or 20 names for the virus” to then call it in his racist way. His endless lying, the need to always blame somebody else, the condescension. I always think of the fact that COVID was named after the shape of a crown, and find it poetically reflecting on the Regime’s toxic tyrannical ambitions.</i>",
