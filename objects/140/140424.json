  "text": "This artwork is part of the series COVID-19: Labor Camp Report.   \r\n\r\nArtist's statement on this artwork originally published on the @laborcamp Instagram account: \r\n\r\n<i>There is no doubt that the Regime uses history as a tool of manipulation and oppression. The truth has been systematically warped, erased, and/or falsified to suit the needs of the ruling class. This continues to this day: the efforts to enforce “patriotic education” standards, ban the education programs that deal with systemic racism, or the all out attack on the 1619 curriculum, are just a few examples. But there is no greater historical lie, than the way systematic genocide  of Native American populations has been portrayed. Today is Indigenous Peoples Day: a celebration of our true history, which replaces what used to be “Columbus Day.” I am proud to live in Minnesota, one of only 14 states that recognizes this day as the Indigenous Peoples Day.</i>",
