  "text": "This artwork is part of the series COVID-19: Labor Camp Report.   \r\n\r\nArtist's statement on this artwork originally published on the @laborcamp Instagram account: \r\n\r\n<i>Once the issue is framed as “war, ” it is back to normal. It’s the American way. I am thinking of the endless wars, the grotesque amount of resources consumed by the insatiable war machine, the ultimate excuse to tighten the reins of control and evade culpability. Except this time we are fighting the “invisible enemy.”</i>",
