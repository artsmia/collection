  "text": "This artwork is part of the series COVID-19: Labor Camp Report.   \r\n\r\nArtist's statement on this artwork originally published on the @laborcamp Instagram account: \r\n\r\n<i>On Friday our Great Leader proclaimed repeatedly that he was the wall. “The wall between the chaos and the American Dream” he said. We know that the Regime is only interested in dividing us, so no surprise that he thinks he is a wall. But regardless, chaos or dream, sooner or later, the walls always tumble.</i>",
