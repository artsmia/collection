  "text": "This is the title page to a series of six engravings devoted to the Song of Solomon. they are copies of a series engraved by Jan Sadelar I (Brussels 1550-Venice? 1603/4) in 1590.\r\n\r\nHere we see King Solomon sitting on his throne, holding a songbook open to an elaborate musical composition, the motet Duo in Carne une by Andries Pévernage (1542/3-1591). Solomon's grand throne is described in the First Book of Kings, chapter 10: ... the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the finest gold. There were six steps to the throne, and the top of the throne was round behind; and there were arms on either side by the place of the seat, and two lions standing beside the arms. And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps; there was not the like made in any kingdom.\r\n\r\nSoldiers and priests surround Solomon. Nothing suggests the intense sensuality of the cited verse: Cantica (Songs) 1.",
