  "text": "In the midst of temptation and warnings, a man tries to make his way through life.  Avaitia (Greed) holds up a purse.  Conscientia (Consicence) holds up a mirror, while Opinio watches the man carefully. Haggard  Invidia (Envy) eats her heart out, as Tristitia (Sadness) folls along. Festooned with peacock feathers, Superbia (Pride) awaits anyone who fails to follow the path of goodness. Someone was so concerned about such temptations that they painted over the naked rear of Conscience.\r\n\r\nA woman lableled Opinio  adjusts her hair with her hand. A man labeled Homo clasps his hands, interlacing his fingers. A woman labeled Tristitia clasps her hands, interlacing her fingers. A woman labeled Superbia with a peacock-feather headdress holds up a heart decorated with more peacock feathers.\r\n\r\nThis is the fourth print in a series of six that studies the misery of human life. The images were designed by Maarten van Heemskerck and engraved by Philips Galle. Each is accompanied by Latin verses by the learned Dutch polymath Hadrianus Junius (1511-1575), with further verses in French and Dutch below.",
