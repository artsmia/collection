  "text": "In the midst of temptation and warnings, a man tries to make his way through life.  \"Avaitia\" (Greed) holds up a purse.  \"Conscientia\" (Consicence) holds up a mirror, while \"Opinio\" watches the man carefully. Haggard  \"Invidia\" (Envy) eats her heart out, as \"Tristitia\" (Sadness) folls along. Festooned with peacock feathers, \"Superbia\" (Pride) awaits anyone who fails to follow the path of goodness. Someone was so concerned about such temptations that they painted over the naked rear of Conscience.\r\n\r\nA woman lableled \"Opinio\"  adjusts her hair with her hand. A man labeled \"Homo\" clasps his hands, interlacing his fingers. A woman labeled \"Tristitia\" clasps her hands, interlacing her fingers. A woman labeled \"Superbia\" with a peacock-feather headdress holds up a heart decorated with more peacock feathers.\r\n\r\nThis is the fourth print in a series of six that studies the misery of human life. The images were designed by Maarten van Heemskerck and engraved by Philips Galle. Each is accompanied by Latin verses by the learned Dutch polymath Hadrianus Junius (1511-1575), with further verses in French and Dutch below.",
