  "text": "This artwork is part of the series COVID-19: Labor Camp Report.   \r\n\r\nArtist's statement on this artwork originally published on the @laborcamp Instagram account: \r\n\r\n<i>I do often refer to socially-centric artists’ work as “cultural Jiu-Jitsu” because one of the important skills seems to be the ability to use the energy of the opponent against them. My muscle memory took over today, as this drawing practically made itself.</i>",
