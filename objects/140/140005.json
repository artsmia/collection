  "text": "A briliantly colored squre format painting depicting a group of five people seated around a round table out of doors. They and the table are arranged close to the picture plane at the bottom of the picture. The people are seated around the table and it seems like there is a seat reserved for the viewer. Beyond the gathered people a landscape is visible of green hills and in the deep distance there is the hint of a town, at the horizon.",
