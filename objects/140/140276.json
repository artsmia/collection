I wonder how many of you feel the same way: battered by the onslaught of uncertainty, pain, doubt. Unable to consider anything in the future with even a modicum of confidence. The sustained beating of news shrapnel. The inner struggle between the need for all this to be over, and the desire to survive, to sleep it all away. And the nagging realization that none of it is normal.",
