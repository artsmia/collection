  "text": "Jingasa, literally “camp straw hats, ” serve the same function as helmets, however, offer less protection against injuries. Samurai who could not afford a helmet wore simple jingasa on the battle field. Military leaders used jingasa as a lighter alternative to a helmet while riding or in the military camp. During the peaceful Edo period (1603–1868), jingasa became the standard headgear of the samurai class for non-military outdoors activity like hunting since they offered protection against rain and sunshine. This extraordinary example was constructed of thirty-two triangular iron plates with 224 pins. The interior is lacquered in black and has carrying straps that were needed to affix it to the head.",
