I saw them online, surrounded by reports of grief and pain. By anger and hatred. And they reminded me, that in the midst of it all, we still, and always, long for tenderness and love. I am thinking of all those who brave it alone.\r\n\r\nExpectant and defiant. The hugs will come. Though not yet. We need to hold on a little longer. Maybe much longer. But the day will come.",
