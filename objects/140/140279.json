I think about them too. And while the pandemic revealed just how profoundly broken our world is, some things are worth protecting.\r\n\r\nSome things should stay exactly the way they always were. For that to happen, we will have to commit to working towards a greener future. Closer to each other. Closer to earth.\"",
