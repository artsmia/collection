How will the world be different after COVID-19? Will we go back to the way things were before? We are all asking these questions. I think about them too. And while the pandemic revealed just how profoundly broken our world is, some things are worth protecting.\r\n\r\nSome things should stay exactly the way they always were. For that to happen, we will have to commit to working towards a greener future. Closer to each other. Closer to earth.</i>",
