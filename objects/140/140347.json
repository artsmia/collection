  "text": "This artwork is part of the series COVID-19: Labor Camp Report.   \r\n\r\nArtist's statement on this artwork originally published on the @laborcamp Instagram account: \r\n\r\n<i>Today I saw a chart showing the number of new cases of COVID-19 in the US. Unsurprisingly, the steady increase of cases suddenly stops, right after the Regime prohibited CDC from collecting the data from hospitals. When the Regime says they want to protect history, what they are saying is that they are already rewriting it. There is no end to the lies and manipulation. But the truth is always right in front of us. Never take anything at face value. Pay attention. Dig deeper. You have agency over the space between what is said, and what is heard.</i>",
