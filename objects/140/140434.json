  "text": "This artwork is part of the series COVID-19: Labor Camp Report.   \r\n\r\nArtist's statement on this artwork originally published on the @laborcamp Instagram account: \r\n\r\n<i>If yesterday’s Report focused on external protections, today I am diving deep inward. Conjuring up a metaphysical map of the internal feedback loop in which new memories are made up of old memories. A self-sustaining cycle, perhaps a quarantine self-defense mechanism, frantically attempting to make order on the inside out of chaos on the outside. Uroboros of the heart.</i>",
