  "text": "This artwork is part of the series COVID-19: Labor Camp Report.   \r\n\r\nArtist's statement on this artwork originally published on the @laborcamp Instagram account: \r\n\r\n<i>A lineup of profile faces is a classic totalitarian propaganda trope, often reserved for the portrayal of “leadership, ” and capturing the collective zeal for the cause. In today’s drawing, I am repurposing this theme, to depict those who hide their faces in order to violate the people with impunity. What is happening to our country? While the virus devastates our bodies, the Regime demolishes everything else, with equal lethality.</i>",
