  "text": "The fitting is cast roughly resembling a bow with a pierced spherical terminal in each end enclosing a loose ball. It was attached to the waist of a soldier driving a chariot, used as a cleat for tying the reins to leave his hands free for combat. The stylized cicada motif seen on the top of the fitting is meaningful. It was a favored motif during the Shang dynasty, perhaps due to the insect’s fascinating life cycle and ability to split its outer skin annually, thus a symbol of resurrection, rebirth and immortality.",
