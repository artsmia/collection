  "text": "In the foreground, two warriors face off with swords and shields. One just wears cloth, while the other has body armor and a helmet. More men can be seen fighting in the distance, while pairs of animals (lions and dogs), lie in peace. The point is simple: Unlike animals, men are always fight and thus bring misery upon themselves.\r\n\r\nThis is the final print in a series of six that studies the misery of human life. The images were designed by Maarten van Heemskerck and engraved by Philips Galle. Each is accompanied by Latin verses by the learned Dutch polymath Hadrianus Junius (1511-1575), with further verses in French and Dutch below.",
