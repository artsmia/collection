  "text": "This artwork is part of the series COVID-19: Labor Camp Report.   \r\n\r\nArtist's statement on this artwork originally published on the @laborcamp Instagram account: \r\n\r\n<i>The economy: probably one of the most perverted concepts used by the Regime to justify anything, and explain everything. It’s amazing how the news of the epic collapse of the US economy just a few days ago, got drowned by the noise of everything else. It looks like we are heading for the Great Depression era scale hardships, yet all we hear about is just how wonderful the reopening process is going.</i>",
