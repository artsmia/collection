  "text": "This artwork is part of the series COVID-19: Labor Camp Report.   \r\n\r\nArtist's statement on this artwork originally published on the @laborcamp Instagram account: \r\n\r\nGeorge Floyd was killed by the police on Monday. He was strangled in broad daylight, on camera, at this corner, while multiple people pleaded with the police to take their knee off his neck. It is important to acknowledge the fact that the same, inherently racist, systemic dynamic which facilitated the murder of George Floyd, is also the reason why twice as many Black Americans die of COVID-19 as whites. Tragedy within tragedy. Black Lives Matter, and we can not let this go on.",
