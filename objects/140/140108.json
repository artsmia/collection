  "text": "This is the final image in a series of six treating the Song of Soloman. Here an allegorical figure, an elaborately dressed woman representing Faith, kneels on the ground and looks up to see Jesus in the heavens. He holds an open a book that says, \"Vox Sponsi -- Verbum Vitae\" (The voice of the bride --  The word of life). Blood gushes from a wound in his side, hits the book, and flows down throughthe dove of the Holy Spirit, finally landing on the kneeling woman. In effect, she has become his bride. Around her are eight crowned women, some with unguent jars,  one holding firewood, one an urn, and another a basket filled with bones.",
