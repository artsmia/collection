  "text": "This artwork is part of the series COVID-19: Labor Camp Report.   \r\n\r\nArtist's statement on this artwork originally published on the @laborcamp Instagram account: \r\n\r\n<i>I am pondering the grave implications of “restarting the economy.” I am thinking of the heartless calculations of the “leadership” regarding the price of the “cure” and the extent of the “problem.” The ruling class only cares about its wealth and power. They are the problem. We are the cure.</i>",
