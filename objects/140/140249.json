  "text": "This artwork is part of the series COVID-19: Labor Camp Report.   \r\n\r\nArtist's statement on this artwork originally published on the @laborcamp Instagram account: \r\n\r\n<i>I can't be the only one feeling temporally and physically disoriented by the experience of the last few weeks. I am in my head, in my home, but also outside, and everywhere in the world simultaneously. Nothing happens, panic holds for days, or explodes and disappears in an instant. Turmoil shifting places at will: it's there, and suddenly here with me. In my hand. Monotonous intensity. Silence and catastrophe. Do you feel it too?</i>",
