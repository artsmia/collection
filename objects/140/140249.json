I am in my head, in my home, but also outside, and everywhere in the world simultaneously. Nothing happens, panic holds for days, or explodes and disappears in an instant. Turmoil shifting places at will: it's there, and suddenly here with me. In my hand. Monotonous intensity. Silence and catastrophe. Do you feel it too'",
