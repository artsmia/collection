  "text": "Iliazd's Ledentu as a Beacon represents a high point in the history of Russian avant-garde book design and experimental typography in the aftermath of the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917. A transitional object that contains elements of both Dada and Futurism, this fascinating book is frequently cited as one of the most radical and innovative of the many avant-garde publications issued during this tumultuous period.  A leading figure of the Russian futurists, Iliazd was instrumental in promoting a cultural and artistic renewal that continues to reverberate to the present day. His experimental designs and unconventional art forms were highly influential and helped spur the expansion of modernism during the early decades of the 20th century.",
