  "text": "The Kuba Kingdom, a pre-colonial kingdom that still exists in the modern state of the Democratic Republic of Congo, is a conglomerate of more than a dozen ethnic groups. This cultural diversity may explain the great variety of Kuba headdresses. This hat is embellished with cowrie shells from the Indian Ocean (about 1,500 miles away) and colorful glass beads,both obtained through trade. The geometric deign is typical of Kuba art, and can also be seen here on the embroidered ceremonial skirts nearby.",
