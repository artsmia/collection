  "text": "When Thomas Moran first arrived in Venice he wrote to his wife, Mary: \"Venice is all, and more, than travelers have reported of it. It is wonderful.\" Moran's exploration of bright color and shimmering light in this romantic watercolor pays homage to the art of J. M. W. Turner and embodies the sentiment of Lord Byron's poem, Childe Harold's Pilgrimage: I loved her from my boyhood; she to me Was a fairy city of the heart, Rising like water columns from the sea, Of joy the sojourn, and of wealth the mart… Perchance even dearer in her day of woe, Than when she was a boast, a marvel, and a show.",
