  "text": "Splashes of fiery red, oranges, and yellow erupt on the left of Thomas Moran’s view of Venice, Italy. He was enchanted from his first trip to the city and it became his primary rejuvenating source of inspiration. He wrote to his wife, Mary: \"Venice is all, and more, than travelers have reported of it. It is wonderful.\" Moran was sensitive to how the changing quality of light affected the color range in sky and water, as well as the reflected tones that illuminate the building facades.",
