  "text": "Death seems to whisper in the woman's ear. His right arm reaches under hers so that he can grasp her head. Her right hand touches his, but the gesture is ambiguous. Does she mean to pull away his hand? If so, she does not do so forcibly. Does she press his hand to her head? Her impassive facial expression gives no clue. The inscription on the upended architectural fragment bears reading: All human beauty is destroyed by death.",
