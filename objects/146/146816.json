  "text": "Stupas were burial mounds created to mark the remains of great teachers in India. Upon the death of the historic Buddha, his cremated remains were divided and transported to sites associated with important events in his life. There, monumental architectural stupas were constructed over them and became pilgrimage destinations for his followers. Later, artisans created scaled-down versions in metal, wood, and precious stone to evoke the presence of the Buddha and his teachings. Such miniature stupas often contain sacred items such as minute scrolls of scripture, small religious images, and relics of later Buddhist teachers.",
