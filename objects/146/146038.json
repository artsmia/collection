  "text": "These three prints are part of the e.e. cummings suite, a group of 21 prints, each titled with a line from cummings’s untitled poem that opens, “anyone lived in a pretty how town” (1940). Hamaguchi traveled to Paris soon after withdrawing from the Tokyo Fine Arts School in 1930 and remained there for nine years. He likely befriended cummings in the early 1930s during the latter’s extended stays. The friendship resulted in cummings sending the young Japanese artist a mezzotint rocker, which Hamaguchi used to make his first copperplate print in 1937. The shifting colors in the suite reflects the dreaminess of the poem.\r\nScan the QR code to read the entire e.e. cummings poem anyone lived in a pretty how town at the Poetry Foundation website. \r\nLINK TO: https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/22653/anyone-lived-in-a-pretty-how-town\r\n",
