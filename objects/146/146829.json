  "text": "Ethan Aaro Jones invites viewers to consider the world around us, and moments that may be easily missed. Taken along the banks of the Hudson River, Jones photographs the natural border between the states of New York and New Jersey, as well as the human-made additions to the environment. Here, the ladder, hoses, and diving helmet imply the interruption or a pause in a moment of exploration, akin to the search for the Northwest Passage that inspired the artist’s series “An Unsearchable Distance,” of which this work is a part of.",
