  "text": "Just as Ottoman textiles were sought after across Europe as luxury objects, Italian velvets were prized at the Ottoman court. Italian and Ottoman weavers took note of this mutual admiration and imitated each other's styles and techniques. Here the bold design of the panels, with large pomegranates set within a vibrant latticework of flowers, reflects the direct influence of Ottoman textiles. While the use of icy blue silk and the addition of the crown and fleur-de-lys to the fruit pattern are characteristic of the Italian aesthetic. This pair of panels can be traced to a in Istanbul already in the 19th century, which may indicate that they were exported to Turkey at the time of their production.",
