  "text": "Spanish ceramic production was the most sophisticated in Europe in the 1400s. This lusterware dish was produced by Islamic potters in Manises, Valencia--an important center of production for the luxury wares. It was commissioned by the distinguished Morelli family of Florence and exported to Renaissance Italy. The Morelli arms appear at the center of the dish, surrounded by a fusion of Islamic and Gothic decorative motifs rendered in glazes of shimmering copper and cobalt blue.",
