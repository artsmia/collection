  "text": "Wenceslaus Hollar was a Bohemian prolific printmaker who had an international career, including work for the highest echelons of British aristocracy. In the 1640s, he joined other Royalists who fled the English Civil War, temporarily settling in Antwerp. There he worked on a series of etched still-lifes of muffs.\r\n\r\nOne immediately senses this pleasure this little accessory could bring. One of Hollar’s fashion plates shows a woman dressed for winter weather. She wears a muff, and beneath the image is a short verse:\r\n\r\nThe cold, not cruelty makes her wear\r\nIn Winter, furs and Wild beasts hair\r\nFor a smoother skin at night, Embrace her with more delight.\r\n\r\nIn short, this fur also makes its wearer all the more desirable.",
