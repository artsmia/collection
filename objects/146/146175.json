  "text": "The work consists in a rectangular composition where thin vertical plastic strips of different colors are fixed in close proximity and parallel to each other. When the viewer faces the work, the predominant color on the surface is blue and overlapping squares with different shades of blue, yellow, brown, and red can also be glimpsed. Those are not colored shapes, but chromatic areas produced by the combination and distribution of the colors in the composition. As the viewer moves in front of the work, the colors begin interacting with each other in a kind of “moiré” effect that completely changes the perception of the colored surface. This effect is typical of the Physichromie series, that the artist defined as not a painting but “a platform, where color is being produced, dissolved, generated in a perpetual instant”.",
