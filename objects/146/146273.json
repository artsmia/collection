  "text": "While on a pilgrimage at Joshua Tree National Park, where she was “seeing [her] father through the end of his life,” Cara Romero found solace in contemplation of the Joshua tree (known as tsawarümp [tsah‑wah‑ROOMP] in the Chemehuevi language). In Towük Kani (We Are Home), the trees appear as if animated within the landscape, underscoring their importance as “ancient spirit beings in our shared ancestral homelands of the California desert,” in Romero’s own words. Her photograph is an act of respect for the trees, and a manifestation of her protective stance toward them as spiritual relatives.",
