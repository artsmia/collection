  "text": "Photographer Cara Romero regularly references family photographs in her work, seeing them as a vital counterpoint to the visuality of anthropological publications such as National Geographic. In The Zenith, she positions the artist George Alexander against a dark background, wearing an astronaut’s helmet and blue coveralls and seeming to float amongst a constellation of white cobs of corn. In his own work, Alexander frequently includes the astronaut helmet, which he describes as a “metaphor for humanity.” For Romero, the portrait of Alexander is a “fantasy and hope [...] that imagines him in a wonderful future.”",
