  "text": "A white ceramic sculpture with occasional black dots in the shape of a flat crown formed out of wispy clouds. The work balances on three points at the bottom where the stroke-like formations converge. Like airy whipped cream or meringue, the ends stand in small peaks. The surface is smooth but slightly gritty in texture. The base layer, rising like a wave, approaches but does not touch the top layer, leaving empty space through the middle. Each piece of clay seems to separate into thinner fibers that twist and turn.",
