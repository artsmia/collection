  "text": "Jacques Villon was a prolific printmaker whose working career spanned more than seventy years from the 1890s to the 1960s. Over the years, his style changed with modern artistic currents. Boudeuse (The Brooding Woman) comes from his Belle Époque phase, when he explored Parisian nightlife alongside artists such as Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec and Edgar Degas. Turning the brooding woman away from us, Villon leaves us to speculate about what troubles her. The watchful male artist has emphasized her flawless skin, hour-glass figure, and state of partial undress--and thus her desirability and vulnerability.",
