  "text": "A plunging, diagonal horizon line divides this winter landscape at center. In the bottom half of the painting, fresh snow covers the ground, scatted with shadows from a cluster of pine trees. Those pine trees fill the center of the painting, bending under the weight of large packs of snow. One tree trunk is bent at nearly a ninety–degree angle. The snow and trees are crisply painted and brightly illuminated. Beyond the horizon, a dense forest is rendered in cool tones of purple, blues, and greens, painted with very loose brushwork. The forest sprawls out beneath a cloudy gray sky, with faint warm light at the horizon line dissolving in the cooler tones of the forest below and the sky above. ",
