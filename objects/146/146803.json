  "text": "Early in his career, the Finnish artist Väinö Blomstedt traveled to Paris, where he studied with Paul Gauguin and aligned himself with a group of forward-looking painters from across Europe. When he returned to Helsinki, he taught at the Finnish Art Association and the Central School of Art and Design, guiding subsequent generations of Finnish painters towards new and modern styles of painting. He painted winter landscapes like this one outdoors, braving freezing conditions to capture Finland’s vast and largely untouched wilderness. In 1904, the Grand Duchy of Finland remained under Russian imperial control and Blomstedt’s Winter Landscape is emblematic of broader Finnish resistance to Russian political and administrative influence, staking a claim for a distinctive cultural identity.",
