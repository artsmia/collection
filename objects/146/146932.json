  "text": "Napoleon fish, or the humphead wrasse, inhabit the coral reefs of the Indian and Pacific Oceans and Red Sea. Males typically grow to about 3 feet long, while females are smaller. Its name derives from the hump on its head that resembles Napoleon Bonaparte’s hat, known as a bicornes. They are endangered due to overfishing and habitat destruction.\r\n\r\nImai Sadamasa (1989-) grew up in a family of ceramic artists. His grandfather, father, and uncle all made ceramics, and he naturally grew up playing with clay. Though Sadamasa is known for his “super realistic” sculptures, he argues that he is not aiming for realism but rather striving to grasp the essence of the animals he creates.\r\n",
