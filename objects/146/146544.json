  "text": "Miriam Schapiro, a major force in the feminist art movement, made this homage to Russian modern artist Sonia Delaunay (1885-1979) at a time in which she was \"looking for \"legitimate ancestry.\" Schapiro meant earlier female role models who sheried her heritage and asserted their creativity confidently at a time in which women artists were marginalized. Delaunay works across materials and was an innovator across formats. Schapiro took that to heart and made a career that sprang in multiple dimensions.",
