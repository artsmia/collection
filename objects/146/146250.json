  "text": "Michikawa Shōzō was born on the northern island of Hokkaido, left to study in Tokyo, and now lives farther south, in Seto, Aichi Prefecture. He has exhibited and taught workshops all over the world, including in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Italy. Michikawa’s unconventional techniques include twisting the clay to create fractures and facets. This sculpture looks like a tea kettle but is in reality not functional. The pyramid-like form itself is as far away from traditional kettles as it can be. Michikawa added a handle that is three times the height of the kettle, thus making it abundantly clear that this is not for use but a sculpture.",
