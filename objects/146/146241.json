  "text": "Kawamoto Gorō was one of the most innovative ceramic artists in Japan in the post-World War II period. Born to a family of potters who produced wares traditionally made in the Seto region, he abandoned the well-known styles in the 1950s to produce unconventional and radical pieces and it is these hand-built forms that set him apart from others. This monumental vessel is an impressive example of Kawamoto’s masterful command of abstract decorations on individual forms.",
