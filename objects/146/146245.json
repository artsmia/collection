  "text": "For George Segal, the human figure served as the principal inspiration for his creative practice, which embodied painting, sculpture, installation, and printmaking. Walter, from the series “Portraits,” reveals Segal’s fascination with the portraiture of 17th-century Dutch artist Rembrandt van Rijn, who regularly used contrasts of strong light and heavy shadow (chiaroscuro) for dramatic, even theatrical effects, as if the individuals portrayed were actors performing on a spotlighted stage. Segal takes this analogy further by using etching, drypoint, and selective inking and wiping of the plate to produce his portrait, echoing the intaglio printmaking techniques favored by Rembrandt.",
