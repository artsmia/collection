  "text": "Frits Thaulow was one of the leading Norwegian artists of the 19th century. He traveled widely and settled in France in the 1892, where he remained the rest of his life. He specialized in winter scenes and depictions of rivers. This pastel represents the spring thaw on the snowy Norwegian Lysaker River, near the Grini Farm in Bærum, Norway, where the artist lived from 1887 to 1889. Thaulow revisited this scene and composition many times over his career. The pastels and prints range in size, date, and mood. The melting snow, moving water, and reflected light in the river provided Thaulow with endless variation to study.",
