  "text": "The histories of those who work on behalf of museums are usually found within archival materials. In this case, the photographer Stuart D. Klipper made this portrait of Evan Maurer, who served as Mia’s director for sixteen years, while he was traveling in New Mexico for work. Klipper’s elongated horizontal composition emphasizes the expanse and openness of New Mexico’s landscape, and is potentially a nod to the photographer’s admiration of his Maurer’s work.",
