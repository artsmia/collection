  "text": "Danish artist Carl Holsøe devoted much of his career to painting atmospheric interior scenes with precisely studied light and harmonious colors. He mostly painted domestic scenes, but he occasionally studied church interiors. Here we look down the nave of the Sct. Nicolai Kirke (St. Nicholas Church) in Køge, a seaport 24 miles south of Copenhagen. \r\n\r\nHolsøe paid close attention to the effect of multiple light sources--some hidden--illuminating whitewashed walls, polished brass chandeliers, richly toned wooden pews, and worn stone floors. His work has often been likened to that of Dutch 17th-century artists, and this picture can be seen as a modernized homage to the likes of Emanuel de Witte and Pieter Saenredam. Perhaps Holsøe sought out the St. Nicolas Church because its major interior features are from the 17th century: altarpiece painted by Lorenz Jørgensen, 1652; pulpit carved by Hans Holst, 1624.",
