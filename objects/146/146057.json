  "text": "An anonymous mass of umbrella-toting cyclists rapidly peddle past a massive bright yellow hibiscus. Seven umbrellas hint that seven corresponding cyclists must be hiding underneath, but they are invisible. They move so fast that their bodies become enveloped in motion, represented by a series of scratches. According to Kuroda Shigeki, his signature cyclists are not in fact cyclists at all, but rather a representation of time and space. In this print, Kuroda playfully juxtaposes the stillness of the bright yellow hibiscus, surrounded by color, and the motion of the hurried cyclists depicted in black, thereby creating a sense of everyday absurdity.\r\n\r\n",
