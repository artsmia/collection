  "text": "A beautiful woman dressed as a courtesan and accompanied by a young attendant encounters an old monk in this print. The woman dons a pale blue kimono decorated with the King of Hell Enma seated at a desk with a large opened book before him and blue demons stirring cauldrons below. Her garment signals that she is Hell Courtesan (Jigoku Dayū), a 15th-century courtesan who attained enlightenment with the help of the monk Ikkyū. The text in the cartouche at the top left combines two legends associated with Ikkyū: that Ikkyū wrapped his loincloth around a statue of Jizō, a bodhisattva; and that he was respected by the Hell Courtesan.\r\n\r\nThis print was part of a series titled Fifty-Three Pairs of the Tōkaidō Road, a play on the “53 Stations of the Tōkaidō, ” which referred to the highway system that connected Edo and Kyoto. This series was a collaborative venture involving print artists Utagawa Kuniyoshi (1798-1861), Hiroshige (1797-1858), and Kunisada (1786-1865). Each print highlights a legend or play that took place at the named station.",
