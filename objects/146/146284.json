  "text": "Lockwood de Forest was a key figure in the spreading of Orientalism in the decorative arts in the United States. Having traveled extensively through Italy, the Near East, North of Africa, and India, he began his career as a painter influenced by Frederic Church and other artists from the Hudson River School. This painting was made during a trip to Egypt in 1876, when the artist produced a series of sketches of the banks of the Nile River under different effects of light, some of which he would later use as basis for studio paintings.   \r\n",
