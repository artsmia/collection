  "text": "Rascism Kills was commissioned by the NE Sculpture Gallery Factory as a part of the Social Justice Billboard Project. The project was created in response to the murder of George Floyd and public unrest in the days and weeks that followed. Situated at George Floyd Square in Minneapolis, the billboard was on view for three months. As part of the project, Fitch also created a series of wheatpaste posters which he continues to distribute along with his other wheatpaste projects. The design, in all of it's forms, is a powerful reminder of the consequences of unchecked systemic rascism and white supremacy, and serves as a rallying call for collective acknowledgement and action agains racial injustice.",
