  "text": "A hexagonal form with an impressive amount of gold and silver inlaid into the iron body, using the technique nunome-zogan. The gold-inlaid lid shows a literati scene of a scholar in his thatch hut in a lake setting. The ripples on the lake give a feeling of motion to the water. The trunk of an old pine tree is at left, its branches reaching to the top and across. On the right and towards the center are many cherry blossoms suggesting springtime. There are mountains in the distance and other designs and reeds in the foreground. Each of the six sides of the box has a different classic textile design achieved by using hundreds of pieces of inlaid silver. The designs are in fine detail and include a tortoiseshell pattern of decorated hexagons, an ancient Chinese key-fret design, and the treasured pattern of asa-no-ha (stylized hemp leaf).",
