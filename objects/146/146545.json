  "text": "The years 1961-63 were for artist Miriam Schapiro, a \"period of renewal\" in which she explored imagery that helped her find a \"new image of self.\" She had spent the previous decade making fully abstract paintings. Gradually she started to define images of shrine-like niches and structures in the work and spontaneously the egg form began to appear. Schapiro, who went on the be one of the most important figures in the feminist art movement considered these new paintings the beginning of a search for imagery that connected her to matriarchal ancestors and her own indentity as female.",
