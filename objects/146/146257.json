  "text": "Ikkyū  Sōjun was an eccentric monk who challenged rules and expectations in Zen Buddhism, such as the prohibition against sex. Having studied Chinese literature and art growing up in a temple, he was skilled at poetry and calligraphy. In this example, Ikkyū  modified a composition by late Tang dynasty poet Zheng Gu (851?–910) about the bittersweet parting of two friends: One note of a flute as we leave the pavilion at dusk You are going to Xiaoxiang, I am going to Qin Ikkyū ’s swift brush and rhythmic line evoke the flow of the Xiao and Xiang Rivers.",
