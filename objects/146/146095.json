  "text": "Twenty-one cherries emerge from darkness. The cherries are at once the same and different—facing forward, turning backward; connected by an arched stem or left alone with a stubby stem; rotating and standing still. Even the black is not uniform but rather textured. Hamaguchi Yōzō’s prints encourages close observation, as details reveal themselves one by one. Hamaguchi was a master of the mezzotint, a printing technique invented in Germany in the 17th century notable for its ability to render halftones. Once popular as a method of mechanical reproduction for paintings, the mezzotint fell out of favor with the invention of photography. Hamaguchi not only revived the printing method but also developed a way to add color by using multiple printing plates. \r\n",
