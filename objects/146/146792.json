  "text": "The majority of armor masks were only half length, leaving the eyes and forehead uncovered. This is a full-face mask constructed in two segments by Myōchin Muneakira, who is considered one of the greatest armor makers in Japan’s history. Including this one there are only four masks known that he inscribed with a date. He created this one in 1737 when he was 54 years old and, in his peak, attested by the exceptional level of smoothness and elegance and the perfectly curved lines and balanced forms.\r\n\r\n",
