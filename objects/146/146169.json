  "text": "Yagi Akira, the son of Yagi Kazuo (1918–1979), who co-founded the avant-garde ceramics group Sōdeisha in Kyoto in 1948, follows a distinctly different path from his father. While his father was a pioneer in ceramics, Akira has carved out his own niche, focusing on porcelain vessels that continually push the boundaries of perfection in form and glazing. His creations, though small and intimately-sized, transcend mere functionality, embodying an obsessive pursuit of artistic perfection.",
