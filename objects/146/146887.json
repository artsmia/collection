  "text": "From the firy darkness, a single thin tree trunk emerges and cuts through the air, its skinny limbs stretching towards something beyond the picture frame. This work is a mezzotint: a technique of printmaking that begins with making small repetitive marks throughout a copperplate with a half-moon tool called a rocker and then flattening areas of lighter color. The movement of the rocker yields the soft, glowing effect in black. Hamanishi usually begins with a drawing on paper, which he reverses to make templates. He then creates smaller aluminum plates for designated areas to add color. In this print, he displays an interest in the elegant forms of everyday sights.",
