  "text": "Created in response to the 2008 GOP National Convention in St. Paul, MN, the work is iconic of Fitch's signature style. The poster invokes lucha libre, or masked wrestling, mateches. Except this time the fight is not between two masked men, but for the American presidency. \"Obama vs. McCain.\" Fitch created the poster as part of a larger \"Get out the Vote\" campaign, in this case targeting St. Paul and Minneapolis' large Hispanic population---a group who had historically been overlooked in Minnesotan political campaigns.  Tongue in cheek, the poster pokes fun of the political spectacle while taking an important political stance.",
