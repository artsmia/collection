  "text": "Four years in the making, Alec Soth's artist's book, Broken Manual (2010), was designed as an underground guidebook for those hoping to escape their lives. Through image and word, Soth investigates places where people retreat from civilization. His photographs of hermits, monks, survivalists, and others living off-grid are accompanied by reflections written by Lester B. Morrison (pseudonym for Soth himself) that include such tips as disguising one's appearance and devising a new identity. Ultimately, the book offers a glimpse into Soth's private world, one in which he examines his own motivations, fears, and doubts.",
