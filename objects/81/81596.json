  "text": "Highly decorated bowcase and quiver sets were worn by men of high status among the Apsaalooka.  Composed of otter skin and large beaded panels, this type of object is included among other prestigious accoutrements such as shields and feathered headdresses, which also marked a man's honor and importance in his community.  Explorers who met the Apsaalooka in the 1830s wrote that only very well-dressed men owned an elaborately ornamented bowcase and quiver set.",
