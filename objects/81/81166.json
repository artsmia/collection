  "text": "Roman portraiture went through many stylistic stages over the centuries. By the late 2nd century A.D., Roman artists created portraits that turned away from the classical forms first used in the Augustan period (44 B.C.-14 A.D.) and later in the Hadrianic period (117-138 A.D.), and returned to more realistic renderings of the individual's facial features. \r\nThis head is compact and solid with relatively little modeling of the forehead. A slight smile plays across the lips, which have been accentuated by the use of the drill at the corners of the mouth. However, the hair lacks the elaborate drillwork and intense facial expression that characterize other works of the same period.",
