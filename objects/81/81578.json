  "text": "The Modernist philosophy of 'form follows function' was inspired in part by folk objects such as this Swedish market basket.  Its innovative use of wood shavings and the simplicity of its structural form creates an unadorned object of exceptional beauty which is testimony to the anonymous artists who make utilitarian objects that enrich our lives.",
