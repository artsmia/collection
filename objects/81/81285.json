  "text": "This intricately wrinkled and textured ying stone is a classic example of a \"distant view mountain\" rock. Deep crevices traverse the rock's middle giving it the impression of several mountain peaks separated by gorges. The white calcite inclusion approximates the look of a mountain glacier. Miniature mountain landscapes form a sub-category of scholar's rocks. More reflective of the natural environment than the dramatically convoluted and perforated ling-pi and tai-hu scholar's rocks, they were perfect for studios that lacked views of a distant landscape.",
