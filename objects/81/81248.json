  "text": "Even though Inoue Yasunori is the son of potter Inoue Manji, who was designated Living National Treasure in 1995, he was not inclined, at first, to pursue a career in the arts. Only after he completed his degree as a structural engineer in 1981 did he begin to study with his father. Since that time he has enjoyed considerable success in juried pottery competitions. Like his father, he works primarily in white porcelain, to which he applies pale or transparent glazes. Unlike his father, who often embellishes his wares with traditional floral motifs, Yasunori's approach is more abstract. For this large platter, he carved the surface of the porcelain in irregular concentric circles. As the glaze liquefied in the heat of the kiln, it flowed towards the center, becoming progressively darker where it is thickest.",
