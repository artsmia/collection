  "text": "In Greek mythology Medusa was a beautiful priestess of Athena, the goddess of war. Medusa angered Athena, who punished Medusa by transforming her into a powerful monster with snakes in place of hair and a gaze that turned those who looked at her to stone. In Hosmer’s hands, Medusa retains her beauty, her hair writhing in transformation. Hosmer herself experienced supernatural events—premonitions, clairvoyance (perceiving things through extrasensory perception), and visits from spirits—so she may have considered Medusa’s curse a gift rather than a detriment. Perhaps she associated Medusa’s changed state with one of power and authority, as much to be respected as feared.",
