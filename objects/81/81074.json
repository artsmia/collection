  "text": "Harriet Hosmer is widely recognized today as one of the first and most skilled female sculptors in America.  She was particularly interested in the historic plight of women, which is seen in her extraordinary bust of Medusa, created in 1854.  In Greek mythology, Medusa was a beautiful girl cursed by Athena, who mutated her into a vile, homely Gorgon.  Medusa's hair turned to snakes and she gained the power to petrify men.  Hosmer's Medusa is compassionately rendered in a fixed state of transformation, with snakes intertwining her lovely hair.  In addition, Medusa bears two feathered wings, reminiscent of the winged horse Pegasus that was born from her neck after she was beheaded.",
