  "text": "This portrait head, with its resolute upward gaze, can be associated with works from the reign of the Emperor Gallienus. At this time, artists worked in a more abstract style that simplified the structure of the head and imposed superficial graphic elements on the surface. Individual features, like the lines of the forehead and the detailed treatment of the hair, rendered with the short strokes of the a penna technique, are characteristic of this form of portraiture.",
