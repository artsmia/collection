  "text": "This youthful satyr, once part of a complex group, sits on a blocky base and turns his head and body sharply to his right. The remains of his right thigh show that the leg was extended for additional support.\r\nThe satyr's general pose, his expression, and the fragmentary hand at the back of his head recall elements of a Hellenistic symplegma, or erotic group. This type of sculptural group involved members of the Dionysian entourage in compositions of closely intertwined limbs and physical struggles.",
