  "text": "The wrestler Tagonoura Tsurukichi (1829–1900) was 37 years old when he appeared in this tournament in the third month of 1866. Tsurukichi had come to Edo from the southern island of Kyushu and at that time had been a wrestler for six years. This tournament was the last one in which he fought under the name Tsurukichi; he then changed it to Kazō, which he used until his retirement five years later. Wrestlers, like kabuki actors, would change their name to indicate that they had reached a new point in their professional life.",
