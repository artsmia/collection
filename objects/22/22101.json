  "text": "Michael Steiner has been exhibiting since 1962, when he was eighteen. Over the years, his sculpture has evolved from an early exploration of minimal “primary structures” to an intensive exploration of the legacy of Cubist construction. This small cast object, Horus, is iconic of the artist's style of the late-1970s.",
