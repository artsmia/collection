  "text": "For this autumnal scene Hiroshige was inspired by a poem by Kisen Ho_shi, a 9th century Buddhist priest who lived in the mountains near Uji, southeast of Kyoto. Hiroshige included the poem in the upper portion of the print: \r\n\r\n\t\t\tLowly hut is mine\r\n\t\t\t\tsoutheast of the capital--\r\n\t\t\tThus I choose to dwell;\r\n\t\t\t\tAnd the world in which I live\r\n\t\t\t\tmen have named a \"Mount of Gloom.\"\r\n\r\nThe melancholy tone of the poem is echoed by Hiroshige's portrait of the poet shown here in a windswept landscape with maple leaves swirling about him. His attention appears to be taken with the sorrowful cry of a deer, shown here in the distance.",
