  "text": "This pair of corner cabinets displays characteristics of the early Neoclassical style in their restrained, symmetrical forms, ormolu (gilt-bronze) mounts, and wood veneers, or thin sheets of wood.\r\n\r\nJean-Chrysotome Stumpff was originally from southwestern Germany but came to Paris in 1760 and worked in the Rococo and Neoclassical styles. He is best known for his dynamic veneer work employing the natural patterns of the thin sheets of wood to create geometric and floral patterns.",
