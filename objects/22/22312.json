  "text": "The neoclassical design of this chair is loosely based on ancient Grecian Klismos (italics) chairs, yet the quatrefoil in the center of the middle slat suggests the influence of the Gothic revival style that gained popularity in America during the 1830s.  The front legs and splayed feet were formed through skillfully turning wood rods at two axis points.",
