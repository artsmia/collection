  "text": "Philadelphia-born Louis Faurer thrived while photographing city scenes and frequently pictured the interplay of reflections. Here, a man on crutches emerges as if from the legs of a mannequin, a potential reference to the man’s own partially visible legs. Faurer’s composition, however, leaves other things unresolved, including his own location on Market Street in Philadelphia on that day.",
