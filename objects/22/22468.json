  "text": "Miyanoshita, one of the seven hot springs in Hakone area, is located on a steep embankment above a mountain stream. Affording a breathtaking view of the mountains that rise on the opposite side of the valley, the inns of Miyanoshita were a particularly relaxing retreat to the visitors. On the path leading to the inns, Hiroshige placed a group of such travelers. They look admiringly at the dramatic scenery and one man even dances with joy.",
