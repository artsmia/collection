  "text": "Lord Enya was forced to commit ritual suicide to atone for having drawn his sword at court. His faithful retainers are disbanded, thus losing their livelihood. Their daily struggle to survive is worsened by the necessity of contributing funds to carry out their revenge plan.  Act 5 describes such difficulties involving the retainer Hayano Kanpei and his wife Okaru. Trying to help his son-in-law, Okaru's father obtained money by promising to sell his daughter into prostitution. While returning home with the money, however, he is robbed and killed by Ono Sadakurø. Kanpei in a later scene mistakes Sadakurø for a wild boar and shoots him. Kanpei steals the dead man's purse without knowing the money was originally meant for him. Hokusai's dynamic rendering of act 5 is comprised of three different vignettes, including Sadakurø's murder.",
