  "text": "By the late 18th century, a thriving culinary culture had emerged in Edo that catered to the city's wealthy residents. By the 1830s, printed guides ranking the best restaurants were published regularly and avidly read by food enthusiasts. In addition, restaurants became meeting places for the members of poetry societies and other cultural groups because their members were already regular patrons of popular chefs.\r\n\r\nThis print, from a set of thirty by Hiroshige depicting the top restaurants in Edo, shows visitors leaving an establishment called Tagawaya. A man wearing a dark yellow jacket who seems to be drunk is leaving the restaurant together with his friend who holds a white towel to his forehead. Since the restaurant was located right by the Yoshiwara pleasure quarter, a prostitute, shown dressed in the purple gown, is in the party.",
