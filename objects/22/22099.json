  "text": "One of the most important Latin American artists of the 20th century, Jesús Rafael Soto began gaining promi- nence while living in Paris in the mid-1950s. There he took part in the exhibition “Le mouvement (The movement),” the first exhibition of artists exploring optical effects that give the observer the illusion of movement in an artwork. In Light Trap, this illusion is provoked by a vertical wire placed in front of a lined background, causing visual vibrations when the spectator moves in front of it.",
