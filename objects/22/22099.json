  "text": "One of the most important Latin American artists of the 20th century, Jesús Rafael Soto began gaining promi- nence while living in Paris in the mid-1950s. There he took part in the exhibition “Le mouvement (The movement), ” the first exhibition of artists exploring optical effects that give the observer the illusion of movement in an artwork. In Light Trap, this illusion is provoked by a vertical wire placed in front of a lined background, causing visual vibrations when the spectator moves in front of it.",
