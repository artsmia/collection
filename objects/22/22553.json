  "text": "The game played here is <I>kazu-ken</I>, a numbers game that originated in China. In this game, players make numbers from zero to five with their right hands, while predicting and then calling out the combined number from all players. The loser has to drink a cup of sake.\r\n\r\nThis is a visual parody of the Kabuki play <I>Sukeroku’s Affinity for Edo Cherry Blossoms</I> (<I>Sukeroku yukari no Edo zakura</I>), but none of the three figures is a Kabuki actor. The story of the play centers on the love affair between the prostitute Agemaki and the dashing dandy Sukeroku, who is playing with his rival Ikyū (left).\r\n\r\n",
