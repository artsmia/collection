  "text": "Two lively wise men are shown here engaging in expressive conversation under a drooping pine tree. The inscription, however, adds a layer of political commentary to this work, which was executed around the time of the collapse of the increasingly corrupt Ming court, resulting in the Manchu takeover in 1644. The poem implies that the men, whose bodies are bent, have better characters (i.e., stand straighter) than those in the corrupt court. It reads:\r\n\r\nCrippled Zhang, carrying dishes of food, off to visit kin,\r\nmeets hunchbacked Li along the way, and \r\nexchanges words of wisdom with him.\r\nThe two men clap their hands in glee,\r\nand laugh out loud: Ha, ha!\r\nNowhere in this world is there a man\r\nwho stands quite straight!",
