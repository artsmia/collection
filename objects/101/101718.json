  "text": "Edison Cummings is a contemporary silver artist who explores non-traditional forms in his work.  Originally trained as a painter, he quickly turned to three-dimensional pieces, preferring to focus on the sculptural aspects of silversmithing.  Inspirations for Cummings's art include architectural elements, found objects and the traditional designs of the Diné.  This combination of influences can be seen in the elegant lines of this teapot, which blends functionality with a unique elegance of shape.",
