  "text": "Jennifer Lee is one of the most highly regarded British ceramic artists working today. Born in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, she studied ceramics at the Edinburgh College of Art and the Royal College of Art.  Her work carries on the quiet, powerful qualities of British ceramics as explored by experimental mid-century modernist potters Hans Coper and Lucie Rie. \r\n\r\nBronze Specked Pot is characteristic of Lee's recent work.  This highly-refined vessel is hand-built on a deceptively precarious foot.  Lee does not use glazes.  The pot's contrasting colors and textures are crafted through Lee's personal technique of weaving different clay bodies into the original material.  These integrated bands are visible in the pot's interior.  A final burnishing of the form completes this meditative process, resulting in a form of precision and refinement created without the use of a wheel.",
