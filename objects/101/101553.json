  "text": "Trained as a sculptor by French masters Pajou and Houdin, Thomire became a master in his own right, specializing in ornamental bronze work.  This Neoclassical chariot scene, which may have been inspired by the Parthenon Mables, is a wax model for a gilt bronze mount.  When cast, the mount would have been applied to decorate a piece of case furniture.  It is rare for such a wax model to survive, and even more so for it to be signed by the designer (lower right corner.)",
