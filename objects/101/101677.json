  "text": "Where war goes, so does Death. Fritz Eichenberg's experience of World War I left a lasting impression on him, and in 1933, he moved to America to escape the rising power of Adolph Hitler. In 1972, as the Vietnam War dragged on, Eichenberg looked back to the Renaissance for inspiration, and produced a series of illustrations based on Erasmus of Rotterdam's 1511 satirical masterpiece, The Praise of Folly. Erasmus asks     us pointed questions:\r\n\r\nIs not war the very root and matter of all famed enterprises? And yet what more foolish than to undertake it for I know not what trifles, especially when both parties are sure to lose more than they get by the bargain?",
