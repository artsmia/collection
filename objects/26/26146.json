Beaumont Newhall in 'The Daguerreotype in America', referred to this unusual item in the following manner,'Gurney had handbills printed to resemble in size and typography paper money; in each corner were the figures 100 in large type; beneath, written in fine print, were the words 'and forty nine'--the address of his Broadway gallery.' The note has three engraved vignettes Equestrian George Washington, Justice with scales, and an Indian maiden. Borders slightly trimmed, very good condition.",
