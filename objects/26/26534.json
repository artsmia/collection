  "text": "These strip-woven, indigo-dyed garments were created as a set and worn by a man: the sleeveless, flared tunic is called gbariye, and the drawstring pair of wide-waisted breeches is a sokoto. The embroidery designs on the tunic—on the chest and around the pockets—originate from the north of Nigeria, bearing parallels with designs seen throughout the region. The roots of these knot motifs are both in Islamic aesthetics and talismanic (protective) concepts.",
