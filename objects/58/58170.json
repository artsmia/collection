  "text": "Karim Rashid is a well-known name in the design community, with many of his products already found in the American home.  Born in Cairo, Egypt, he was educated in London and Toronto, and began his industrial design career at age nineteen.  Incredibly prolific, Rashid has produced more than five hundred product designs, ranging from chairs to dish soap bottles, for clients such as Nambe, Sony, and Issey Miyake.  Rashid, who put out his autobiography, \"I Want to Change the World,\" in 2001, has been called a modern-day Raymond Loewy.  The curvaceous, handled \"Garbo\" trash can is now a design icon, selling over two million units.",
