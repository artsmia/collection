  "text": "Miss Maud Cassel (Mrs. Ashley) is a perfect example of technique mirroring subject. Maud Cassel was the daughter of industrialist Ernest Cassel-just the sort of social luminary who fascinated Anders Zorn, whose own parents worked in a brewery. Zorn portrayed Maud at her debut into society, using decisive, slashing lines to convey her determined gaze and satisfied pose amid the opulence that defined her life. She later became mother-in-law to Earl Mountbatten of Burma.",
