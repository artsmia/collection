  "text": "This plate displays the Sèvres factory’s unmatched skill in decorating porcelain. At least three painters took part in ornamenting it. One created the enameled garland of fruits and flowers, another painted the cobalt-blue ground, and a third depicted the bronze bust of Benjamin Franklin on a fake marble background. Sèvres produced several images of Franklin but made only a few plates in this neoclassical pattern. This plate seems to be the only one left.\r\n\r\nFranklin was the first American ambassador to France, where he was beloved for his wisdom and diplomacy. He admired French culture, and after returning to Philadelphia in 1785 he promoted French taste in household furnishings.",
