  "text": "The American landscape artist Hugh Bolton Jones trained first in his native Baltimore and then in New York. His earlier works reveal a deep debt to the Hudson River School. His first mature works, however, were produced during a tour of foreign study at the thriving artist's colony at Pont-Aven, France, between 1876 and 1880. Edge of the Moor, Brittany, which dates from that period, reflects Jones's encounter with the Barbizon style and demonstrates his ability to capture seasonal light effects. Obviously pleased with the results, Jones shipped the painting back to the United States in 1877 for display in the National Academy of Design's annual exhibition.",
