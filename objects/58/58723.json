  "text": "A photogram is a photographic image produced without the use of a camera. Objects are placed on light-sensitive paper and exposed to light, resulting in a negative shadow image with tonal variations according to the transparency of the particular objects. In Fotogram II, a strainer or colander is used to create a study of the function and effects of light. As an instructor at the Bauhaus, Moholy-Nagy (pronounced Mo-HA-lee NADGE) experimented with photographic processes in a manner consistent with the art school’s credo: Art and Technology: A New Unity.",
