  "text": "This work is a part of Yoshida Hiroshi’s 1926 Inland Sea Series of nine prints. Six of the prints, including these, show sailboats floating in Japan’s Inland Sea, a body of water bounded by three of Japan’s four main islands. Yoshida used the exact same woodblocks for each of the six prints but adjusted the colors to suggest different weather conditions and times of day. They are a testament to the expressive potential of color and the most iconic works by Yoshida.",
