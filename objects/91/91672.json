  "text": "Ohara Shōson, who also worked under the pseudonyms Ohara Hōson and Ohara Koson, was one of the modern Japan’s most prolific creators of <I>kachōga</I>—prints depicting flowers (<I>ka<I>) and birds (<I>chō</I>). These two late prints offer different takes on the beloved rooster. One shows a rooster beneath the overhanging branch of a blossoming plum tree, watching over a hen and five chicks. The other has a rooster in a standoff with a weasel. In both, Shōson explored the textures and shapes of the roosters’ dramatic tail feathers and combs.",
