  "text": "European silks of the late seventeenth and early eighteenth century often display unusual motifs and dramatic compositions resulting from the interchange between East and West. The successful voyages of the East India trading companies opened up new horizons for European design, as cargoes of porcelain, lacquer work and textiles reached the continent and stimulated the imaginations of artists. These so-called Bizarre silks are characterized by elongated diagonal and exotic, abstract elements, juxtaposed in overlapping patterns and spiraling curves, often enhanced by gold and metallic threads. At this time France took over the lead in the silk industry from Italy, and began to set the tone in fashion. Many bizarre silks were made into clothing, such as men's waistcoats and women's dresses.",
