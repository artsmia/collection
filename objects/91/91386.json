  "text": "This black ink cake takes the form of a shallow dish. It was specially commissioned, along with an identical cake of red ink in the museum's collection, to commemorate an important court event and possibly to be used as an imperial gift. The central medallion is impressed with a pair of gilt dragons flanking a two-character inscription that reads, \"Bestowed by Imperial Command.\" The cavetto bears stylized shou (longevity) characters arranged in two bands. The reverse is decorated with archaistic dragons and a gilt nine-character mark that reads, \"Made by Wang Chin-sheng in the Ch'ien-lung period of the great Ch'ing dynasty.\"",
