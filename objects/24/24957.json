  "text": "The Fulani coverlet for a bride, called a munnyuure, is an exhaustive textile to produce. Indeed, the name munnyuure means to patiently endure, implying that only a very patient weaver is capable of producing this type of blanket without making a mistake. The patterns are created by the weft and must match up with adjacent stripes when sewn together, making it critical that the weaver pay careful attention to the spacing of the various designs. This textile is characterized not only by its construction but also by the use of indigo and natural colored cotton.\r\n\r\nThe munnyuure functions as part of a woman's dress in traditional Fulani society. Women from good families are expected to wear such a garment over their shoulders and head when leaving the house.",
