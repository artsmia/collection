  "text": "Diego de Ágreda’s extensive porcelain dinner service, comprising some 170 pieces, is in Mia’s collection (60.31.1-5, 85.42.4.1-167). Just as his Mexican mines exported silver around the world, particularly to Spain, India, and China, Ágreda imported luxury items to Mexico. He commissioned this service from China in the 1780s and had it decorated with his family coat of arms. His portrait nearby was painted later, and its heraldry reflects Ágreda’s subsequent elevation to rank of count, with a gold crown added atop the lion’s head and helmet.",
