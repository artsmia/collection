  "text": "In 1931 Peggy Bacon sailed to Europe with her artist husband, Alexander Brook (1898-1980). The title of this drawing, done among the cafés in Paris's storied artist hangout, shows her gift for satire. Bacon's métier was her droll wit, and she was celebrated in the 1920s and 1930s for her caricatures. A student of George Bellows and John Sloan, she had a marvelous eye for revealing character.",
