  "text": "A wealthy family would have used this large cupboard as the central storage unit of the household. The cupboard, a veritable fortress within the house, is decorated with a plethora of elements from classical architecture. Dutch architect and painter Hans Vredeman de Vries helped popularize these ancient architectural references in his fashionable engravings. As such, in addition to commanding admiration and respect for the owner’s taste, the cupboard’s façade would have also served as a conversation starter about matters of art, travel, and literature.",
