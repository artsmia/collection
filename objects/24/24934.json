  "text": "The <I>Landaka khasa</I> is one of the five blankets that make up a Fulani bride's trousseau. Unlike the <I>arkila kerka</I> which is suspended, tent-like over the bed, the khasa functions as a man's blanket, providing warmth and protection from mosquitoes during the winter months, from November through February. \r\n\r\nThe Fulani maintain fierce loyalty to traditional patterns and insist that they be used in the creation of their textiles. The number and complexity of the designs may vary, but specific elements are essential to each type of blanket. The <I>Landaka khasa</I> begins with the <I>bitjirgal</I> design representing a water receptacle, followed by a broad red stripe, <I>dakol boderi</I>. The most impressive design, the <I>landal</I>, occupies the central area of the blanket and symbolizes the landscape that the Fulani live, including the paths followed by the nomadic herders, hillocks where villages are constructed, trees, soil and obstacles on the paths.",
