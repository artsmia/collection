  "text": "The application of auxiliary ornamentation to silk fabrics became fashionable in mid-eighteenth century French clothing. Ribbons, pearls, sequins and buttons were incorporated into an embroidered design to add texture and sparkle. Strips of fur, reputedly introduced by Philippe de Lasalle in 1763, remained popular into the 1770s.\r\n\r\nThis piece served as a dressmaker's sample for a panel in a woman's dress. The silk merchant's label, still attached, identifies the piece with a short description and inventory number.",
