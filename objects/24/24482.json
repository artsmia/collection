  "text": "Elaborate silk fabric such as this was very costly to produce. It would have taken at least two highly skilled weavers, using the most sophisticated weaving technology of the period, several days to produce one yard of fabric. It undoubtedly was made as a special order and could have been used for any number of things, ranging from wall covering to men's or women's clothing. It was not until the middle of the 19th century that textiles were designed for specialty markets such as home furnishings or fashion.",
