  "text": "Born and raised close to nature in Washington state, Jim Hodges frequently explores themes of transience, fragility, and abstraction using the natural world as a starting point. His expansive practice emphasizes materials and process, experimental and traditional alike, bringing to the fore concepts that evoke fundamental human experiences and emotions. A common thread is a poetic consideration of life’s many mysteries, including birth, death, love, and the inevitability of change. In the “days” suite of intaglio prints, Hodges uses highly abstracted elements of nature or landscape to capture an ephemeral moment in the constant passage of time.",
