  "text": "Three fishermen stand on the shore of an inlet. Their weather beaten faces signal that they have tales to tell. Hands in pockets, they quietly talk to one another. The Man at the left smokes a pipe, as the other two look at him intently. It is a still and cool day. The men wear jackets, smoke rises from the chimney of a house across the inlet. The house's reflection appears in the water. The scene is a moment of respite in a life of hard and hazardous work.\r\n\r\nThis is one of a series of eight woodcuts about the ordinary of fishermen that Maz Pechstein made in 1923. This is the only one of the series that was printed in color.",
