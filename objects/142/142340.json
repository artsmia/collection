  "text": "Irene Reed was a Connecticut-based artist who worked with a diverse array of media -- including found items -- and off-loom fiber techniques, but was best known for her crochet creations -- typically hats, purses, accessories, and small sculptures. This evening cloche with its central feathered medallion evokes the feeling of an elegant wrapped and bejeweled turban. But Reed's notorious sense of humor breaks through in her selection of buttons and other found item gemstones, and strike a more informal tone.",
