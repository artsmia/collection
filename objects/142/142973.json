  "text": "This generous gift includes signed works on paper and carvings by various Haida artists, pottery by various Pueblo makers, one work on paper by Pueblo painter Dan Namingha, and one work on paper by an Inuit artist. Each of the Haida prints are depictions of traditional Haida stories and the carvings are wood intricately designed. The pottery is all hand built in the traditional coil method of the Pueblo people from various communities. Each piece of pottery is also painted using natural pigments. The print by Dan Namingha is great example of contemporary Pueblo painting. The Inuit work on paper is a beautiful depiction of a seal mask used in Inuit culture.",
