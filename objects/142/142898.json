  "text": "Jack Beal was an American realist painter and printmaker who rejected the emotional intensity and gestural spontaneity of postwar abstract expressionism in favor of conveying ideals such as truth, beauty, and morality through more traditional pictorial representation. His work and practice helped define the New Realism movement of the 1960s, a school of painting that included the American artists Alfred Leslie, Janet Fish, and Philip Pearlstein, among others. This pastel drawing typifies Beal's approach to landscape, which emphasizes the patterns, textures, and color harmonies of the natural world. The scene depicts the rolling hills and stream near his studio and home in Oneonta, New York.",
