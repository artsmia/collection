  "text": "This wildly distorted image of a woman was made to provoke a reaction. It was part of a series of such works that Baziotes used to explore the limits of expression through exaggeration. Is the woman frightened? Is she angry? Shocked or surprised? Or trying to make someone laugh? All could be true as the artist was experimenting with new modes of expression to explore emotion and human experience.",
