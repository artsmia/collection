  "text": "Within this painting Belcourt depicts living beings that are currently threatened, endangered or at the edge of extinction in Mia’s backyard, the Upper Midwest. Each of these species are not only critical for the balance of our ecosystem, but are interconnected to all of life, including humanity. For most Indigenous communities, all life – plants, animals, insects, microbes – are kin, and to be treated with respect and care. \r\n\r\nThese species are painted as if Belcourt were beading them on hide. Belcourt methodically paints from the bottom up, drawing upon designs and motifs found Michif beadwork. Blossoming flowers and wisps of greenery are intricately outlined in the color palette and style of Michif floral imagery, a part of an aesthetic system and of way of life made possible through careful observation of the natural world. The composition of the painting is a seamless whole. It becomes ever more delightful as you move closer to the painting and realize that it is rendered in a Pointillist fashion: Belcourt paints each dot individually, representing a single bead.",
