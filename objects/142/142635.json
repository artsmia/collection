  "text": "Frank Stella titled the prints in his “Exotic Bird” series (1977) after endangered or extinct birds such as the Puerto Rican Blue Pigeon, Steller's Albatross, and the Okinawa Woodpecker. In this example, Stella cites the Inaccessible Island Rail, a type of ground-living bird (Rallidae) found only on Inaccessible Island, an extinct volcano rising out of the South Atlantic Ocean in the archipelago of Tristan da Cunha. This and the other compositions in the series were inspired by the shapes of antique French curves and other drafting tools. Though produced independently, the six prints in the series correspond to Stella’s series of three-dimensional relief paintings of the same subjects.",
