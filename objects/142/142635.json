  "text": "Frank Stella titled the Exotic Bird series (1977) after endanged or extinct birds such as the Puerto Rican Blue Pigeon, the Okinawa Woodpecker, and Inaccessible Island Rail (a type of rail found only on Inaccessible Island). The compositions were taken from antique drafting templates and tools. All six prints in the series correspond to metal relief paintings. Interesting enough, the prints did not serve as preparatory sketches but were made concurrently to the paintings. The print series was one of the first to incorporate the merging of lithography and screenprinting, a combination of printing techniques the artist would continue to use in later works.",
