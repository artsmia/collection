  "text": "A faceless male figure is on his knees with his hands up. One hand is in a gesture of surrender, the other clenched into a fist. The print expresses both the vulnerability and the resilience of young Black men facing police. A crosshairs bull’s eye in red is drawn over the man’s heart. This sign is a Nigerian nisibidi symbol of “speech” and “meeting, ” and a Kongo cosmogram that symbolizes the cycle of life, death, and rebirth. It works as a powerful image of vitality in the face of violence and racism. Indeed, “still I rise.”",
