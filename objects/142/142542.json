  "text": "The works within this portfolio are exceptionally well preserved, and their prime condition allows viewers a view into the color printing practices of the early 1990s.  Since the late 1970s, Skoglund has constructed complex installations that hearken to editorial and commercial photographic practices, embedding a critique of surrounding culture within each.  As one of the foremost names in color photography in the 1980s and 1990s, and noted for her efforts to push the capacities of the medium toward more conceptual and/or political ends, Sandy Skoglund deserves better recognition within Mia’s collection and outside its walls.",
