  "text": "Irene Reed was a Connecticut-based artist who worked with a diverse array of media -- including found items -- and off-loom fiber techniques, but was best known for her crochet creations -- typically hats, purses, accessories, and small sculptures. An important technical innovation of Reed's was to create three-dimensionality by building crochet stitches over sections of trapunto quilting. This winged cloche is reminiscent of the headwear of the Greco-Roman messenger god, Hermes/Mercury. But such a serious reading of the hat quickly unravels when one realizes that the jewels on the matching necklace are actually found buttons.",
