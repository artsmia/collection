  "text": "The Bible says nothing of Mary's death, but legend holds that when Mary was on her death bed, the Apostles, who had scattered throughout the world on their missions, were miraculously transported to gather around her in her final moments. MartinSchongauer presents Mary resting on a large, oppulently draped bed. Though nearing death, she appears youthful. John the Evangelist supports the vigil candle that she has become too weak to hold. In the foreground, two apostles scrutinize a manuscript text. At right, the Apostle Anthony--recognizable from his walking stick--holds a brass bucket of holy water, while another, seemingly Peter, holds the aspergillium to sprinkle water on Mary as a blessing. \r\n\r\nIn the foreground stands an elaborate candlestick, perhaps of the type produced by Schongauer's goldsmith father, who probably taught young Martin to engrave. Martin went on to become a skilled painter. Combining the design skills of painting and the technical skill of engraving, Schongauer produced some of the finest engravings of the 1400s.",
