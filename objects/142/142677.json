  "text": "The Bible says nothing of Mary's death, but legend holds that when she was dying, the Apostles were miraculously transported back from their worldwide missions to see her through her final moments. Martin Schongauer presents her resting on a large, opulently draped bed. Though nearing death, she appears youthful. John the Evangelist supports the vigil candle that she can no longer hold. At right, the Apostle Anthony carries a brass bucket of holy water, while another uses the aspergillum to sprinkle water on Mary as a blessing. \r\n\r\nThe elaborate candlestick recalls Schongauer's goldsmith father, who probably taught young Martin to engrave. Martin went on to become a talented painter. Combining the design skills of painting and the technical skill of engraving, Schongauer produced some of the finest prints of the 1400s.",
