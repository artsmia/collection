  "text": "Fire Field was the last work of art Mary Giles created. It was commissioned for the exhibition “Designing Women II: Masters, Mavericks, Mavens” held at the Egg Collective showroom in New York City in 2018. It is one of only two large-scale wall-mounted works created throughout her career. The other was the similarly titled “Totem Field,” which she created for the 10th International Triennial of Tapestry, Lodz Poland, now held in a private collection.",
