  "text": "Ionel Talpazan first encountered an unidentified flying object (UFO) as a child in Romania. He had run away from home at age eight. As he hid in a ditch, he saw a UFO hovering overhead, its illuminations bringing a sense of calm that told him all would be fine. The event changed his life and his consciousness. As an adult in New York, the artist’s memories fueled ideas about interplanetary beings and space­craft, resulting in a proliferation of images of the inhabited universe and space craft. He told an interviewer that, when he made art, his mind goes direct to the aliens' mind…I try to think like aliens think. I don't know, maybe I get some ideas from other planets, maybe messages come telepathic, from mind to mind.",
