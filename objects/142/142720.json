  "text": "Philadelphia-based artist Sarah McEneaney often depicts herself and her immediate surroundings, carefully observing her environment and presenting it to viewers so they can get a peek into her world. She said of this scene,\r\n\r\nI document my travels with small paintings on paper. They are finished works in and of themselves and sometimes lead to studio paintings once I am at home. [This work was] painted during a trip to Sri Lanka in 2002. My sister Anne and I are seen relaxing under mosquito nets and a ceiling fan in Colombo, Sri Lanka.",
