  "text": "Adriaen van de Velde was a versatile artist, but his mainstay was bucolic imagery featuring livestock and herders. His brief career resulted in endless combinations of cows, goats, and sheep in fictive, Italianate settings quite different from the flat, windswept terrain of his native Holland.\r\n\r\nVan de Velde’s pictures read as arrangements of studiously delineated and carefully illuminated creatures. He is known for his precise draftsmanship and the meticulous finish of his paintings, qualities especially evident in the well-preserved group of sheep and goats at the right.",
