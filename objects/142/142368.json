  "text": "In her print, Tone Deaf, Julie Buffalohead represents the heightened polarization of society as demonstrated by the politicization of the Covid-19 pandemic and its disproportionate impact on Native American communities. Here, two trickster figures, portrayed as anthropomorphized coyotes, symbolize the traditional duality of creator and destroyer. They appear as if suspended in space, an equilibrium of opposites, each bearing attributes associated with their respective beliefs. The pro-mask coyote holds a black face covering bearing the word “Help,” while the anti-mask coyote parades its “patriotic” priorities with an array of U.S. flags and holds a tiny sign reading “Tone Deaf.” The surreal scene plays out between two abstract border panels, which represent ribbon work found on traditional Native American clothing.\r\n\r\nBuffalohead revealed her thoughts on the print’s meaning: “I was interested in exploring this lack of conscientiousness toward other people who are at risk. Framing this into my own context and setting up a drama of flag-like proportions, I reference the cartoon antics of Wile E. Coyote of Looney Tunes to literally hold up a sign provoking conscious action. The pandemic has demonstrated that no one is immune; we are interconnected.”\r\n",
