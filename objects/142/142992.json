  "text": "Workers at a factory leave their industrial job at the lowre right corner of this drawing.They are anonymous, more like forms that the artist has deployed to balance the elements of his composition. They walk before a wall and beyond that the futuristic complex of towers and holding tanks that define this mysterious complex. The artist, an influential teacher of design and devotee to abstraction, explored the revolutionary feeling and meaning of the modern world in works like this.",
