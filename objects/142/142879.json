  "text": "Acclaimed photographer Paolo Ventura found himself in quarantine without his cameras during the early days of the coronavirus pandemic in March 2020. Confined to a holiday apartment in an old monastery in Tuscany, Italy, Ventura discovered that he only had sheets of packing paper and acrylic paint available and started painting images that gave strength and meaning to days that were all the same, all different. The subjects of his daily paintings included interiors, still lifes, and portraits of his partner and neighbors, including this portrait of Vicino di Pianerottolo, a young man who lived in a nearby apartment. Raw and direct, Ventura’s portrait captures the humanity of his subject, while also revealing something of the fear generated by the uncertainties of the emerging pandemic.",
