  "text": "Artists have interpreted the Christian theme of Jesus' Crucifixion in innumerable ways since the second century, CE. The subject represents sacrifice and redemption in Christianity but the meaning and emphasis in images of the Crucifixion vary widely across time and place. Jack Wolfe, an artist working in th Boston area in the wake of the Second World War, produced a monumental image of violence and turmoil that echoed the experience of the war. Painting a balancing act between representation and abstract suggestion, Wolfe crafted the figures in his painting so they writhe and twist, while the environment around them is charged with the intensity of the central action.",
