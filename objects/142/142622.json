  "text": "Albrecht Dürer made this woodcut as the title page image for his monumental book, commonly known as The Large Passion, which depicted key moments surrounding the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus.\r\n\r\nYou may notice inconsistencies in the image, for Dürer combined elements of Christ's experiences and condition before and after his crucifixion. The soldier who mocks him by offering a march reed as a scepter for the King of the Jews did so before the crucifixion. Jesus bears the wounds of the nails that held him to the cross, but they do not bleed and he is alive. The flail and switches that were used to whip him have left no marks on his back. Dürer acknowledged the mystical fantasy by locating the scene on a heavenly bank of clouds.\r\n\r\nThis image proved very popular and was extensively reprinted, so one often finds it printed from a worn-out printing block. This early proof was printed when the block still reflected the clarity and precision that Dürer intended.",
