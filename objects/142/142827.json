  "text": "Mount Fuji, so often depicted with a smooth surface, reveals its craggy face. People walk along a zigzagging path cutting through the center, leading up to the summit. Their white attire, straw hat, and walking stick signal that they are pilgrims of the Fuji cult, which venerated the famous mountain as a god. The path upward is dotted with little huts, which were built and managed by villagers in surrounding areas. At the top of the mountain, five Buddhist sculptures are lined up in front of the crater, which further highlights the religious significance of the mountain. Though painters had depicted Mount Fuji since at least the 11th century, but paintings and prints depicting routes up the mountain became common around the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.",
