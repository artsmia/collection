  "text": "A hanging scroll with a painting of a mountain with a winding path cutting through the center from the bottom to the summit. A long white streak of a cloud snakes behind the mountain, and the blue sky is flecked with gold. The path is lined on both sides by craggy rocks and dotted with eight small square huts on raised platforms. Small figures with wearing a triangular hat and holding a walking stick. A less angular path to the left leads people down and back to the first hut at the foot of the mountain. The summit of the mountain is partly fenced, with a gate for people to walk through when they reach it. Five small Buddhist sculptures and two huts stand around the crater.",
