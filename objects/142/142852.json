  "text": "The surreal portraiture and landscapes of Dennis Farber’s work grapple with familial and cultural memories relating to his own experiences as a Jewish American educator and artist.  Drawing upon family archives as well as his immediate surroundings, Farber’s photographs are accretions of time and space, often deeply saturated with color and personal meaning.  His experiments with black and white Polaroid photography present uncanny assemblages of faces and bodies half-remembered in dreamlike, fathomless, and shadowy spaces.  The haunting effects of his work compel the viewer’s attention, and provide insight into the nature of photographic experimentation in the heady years of the early 1970s.",
