  "text": "A wall-mounted, textile sculpture with a form like an accordion, with folded panels that reveal a light color scheme on one side and dark on the other. From the left, the viewer is able to see the dark colors: deep navy accented by indigo stripes descending diagonally from right to left. From the right, the viewer is able to see the lighter color scheme: grey, accented by deep plum stripes descending diagonally from left to right. From the front, both schemes exist in harmony and balance, as the opposing diagonal lines seemingly intersect as they weave across the textile.",
