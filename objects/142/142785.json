  "text": "Joe Solman was an influential modernist painter based in New York. He was politically active and outspoken on artistic freedom. Among his closest friends were artists who went completely abstract -- Adolph Gottlieb and Mark Rothko -- but Solman was never satisfied with that route. As is evident in his paintings, he preferred to push representation to the edge, putting design and form together to enphasize the modernist grid, but always referred to the observable world.",
