  "text": "Joe Solman emigrated to the U.S. with his family at the age of three. They settled in New York, which later fueled the artist’s imagination and inspired numerous studies of people on subways and other images of the city.  Solman considered his paintings of places – whether they were rooms, cities, streets or buildings – to be “portraits.” In this scene he depicted an abstract houseboat, with a distant glimpse of the city in the background.",
