  "text": "Chicago, Northside Beach, 1965, is an example of Danny Lyon's ability to document life on the outskirts of society without judgement or social critique. The self-taught photographer relies on personal participation from his subjects, documenting first-hand their experiences. When Lyon's photographed the eight youths' portrait, he was in the midst of creating his series The Bikeriders (1963-1967), which documents his time as a member of the Chicago Outlaws Motorcycle Club.\r\n\r\nThe Bikeriders (1968) went on to become a seminal work of New Journalism---a movement that included journalists and writers like Joan Didion, Hunter S. Thompson, and Tom Wolfe.",
