  "text": "The top half of the painting consists of three stacked circles that emanate rays of gold, turquoise blue, and earthen hues. The lower half consists primarily of gold channels with circular forms that have been cut out. Running vertically in the center of the canvas are a series of tear-like shapes in various blue and earthen hues that cascade down toward the center of the canvas. There is a series of solid black circles that appear below the gold layer of paint that are off kilter giving a sense of perpetual motion similar to that of celestial bodies.",
