  "text": "Three geometric shapes are presented in the foreground. From left to right: a pyramid, a sphere, and a cube. A rainbow cuts the background in half, with the left side shades of blue and the right side orange. The artist’s signature is in the upper right corner, reading “Hernmarck 1995”. The text at the bottom of the textile reads: “When he looks at a square, he sees a cube. When he looks at a circle, he visualizes the world. And when he looks at a triangle, he envisions a ray of light refracting through a prism.\"",
