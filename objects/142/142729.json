  "text": "Hollow Man's Cave represent's the best of Robert Motherwell's artistic lexicon---bold use of color, intricate print patterns and shapes, and poetic titles layered with personal meaning. \r\n\r\nMotherwell was a major figure of the Abstract Expressionist generation, his work encompassing the automatism of the Surrealists, the expressive brushworks of action painting, and the saturated hues of field painting. From 1940 to 1941, the artist studied at Columbia University where he met Roberto Matta and other exiled European artists associated with Surrealism. Emotionally charged brushwork and severely structured abstract became a style that Motherwell developed inspired by those he encountered in New York during the 1940's. The artist would return to this method of working throughout his career, most notably later in life. Hollow Man's Cave, with is deep blacks, and muted shapes, references the mourning and grief he illustrated in works created during the 1940s and 1950s.",
