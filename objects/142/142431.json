  "text": "Based in Minneapolis and Chicago, Clarence Morgan is a visual artist and educator whose work encompasses painting, drawing, and printmaking. The focus of his practice is abstraction, often inspired by nature. Working in collaboration with Highpoint Editions, Morgan produced an array of multimedia prints whose evocative titles derive from the arrangements of seemingly random shapes and biomorphic forms that suggest microscopic organisms or alien life forms. Morgan’s intuitive working method allows for chance occurrences and unexpected juxtapositions, yet each composition is structurally harmonious.",
