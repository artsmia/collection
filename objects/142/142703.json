  "text": "Jamillah Jennings has made paintings of many family members and community members over the past few decades. Here, she depicts a young girl in a clean white dress. Is she on her way home from a family party? Is she going to church? She wears it with pride and seriousness, though the artist also seems to hint at play. Her dress sways slightly at the bottom edge, as though the girl has just finished a little jump.",
