  "text": "The two black-clothed figures are Beguines, lay Catholic women who lived quasi-monastic lives in beguinages. The order thrived from the thirteenth until the sixteenth centuries, with the beguinages often becoming sanctuaries for widows. Just a few of these communities remained in Julien Celos’s time. They were no less vital as a religious path for single women, but by then were seen as a romantic remnant of the past.\r\n\r\nThough the location of this scene is unknown, it is very likely inspired by Georges Rodenbach’s Symbolist novel \"Bruges-la-Morte\" (1892). The author repeatedly mentions Beguines, writing that when they circulate through Bruges, they seem not to walk but rather to glide like swans. In the present drawing, Celos picked up on the image of Beguines gliding through the dark and desolate city.",
