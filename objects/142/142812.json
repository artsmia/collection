  "text": "Cloaked in mystery and dwarfed by forbidding architecture, these two black-clothed figures are Beguines, Catholic laywomen who led quasi-monastic lives in communities called beguinages. The order thrived from the 1200s to the 1500s, with the beguinage often becoming a sanctuary for widows. In Julien Celos’s time, just a few of these communities remained and were seen as romantic remnants of the past.\r\n\r\nThis image and its title were very likely inspired by Georges Rodenbach’s symbolist novel Bruges-la-Morte (1892). The author wrote that when Beguines circulated through Bruges, they seemed not to walk but rather to glide like swans.",
