  "text": "A peach-colored coverlet, or colcha, featuring light pastel embroidery depicting the Tree of Life and allegory of the sense of smell. The central focus of the colcha’s design is the Tree of Life, whose green branches extend and curl around the image. The tree features blooming buds and envelopes the flora and birds that surround, with a color scheme including green, yellow, coral, pink, and shades of blue. An elaborate, ornamental green and yellow vine curves along the border of the colcha, accented by pink and coral buds and blooms. Small human figures are visible scattered throughout the scene, enveloped by the nature around them.",
