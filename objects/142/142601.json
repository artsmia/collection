  "text": "The painting is in the shape of a gothic arch. Six figures are represented. A woman, who is larger than the others, is seated at the center on a stone throne and holds an infant in her lap. She wears a veil, a red tunic and a dark blue, ample cloak with a gold embroidered border. The child wears a pink tunic, red cloak and holds a small bird in his left hand. At their feet appear four figures gazing up at the central figures reverently. These include, on both the left and right, a feminine-featured figure kneeling with long blond hair and green tunic. Seated before them, on each side, is a bearded man. The man on the left has long dark hair and beard, wears a fur shirt and red cloak, and holds a reed-cross and small banner with the words ECCE AGNUS DEI. One the right, the bearded man is older; he wears a miter and bishop’s cope and holds a gold crozier. All six figures have gold haloes.",
