  "text": "Simon Denny’s Global Charge 3 is deceptive in its simplicity, literally embedding a critique of neoconservatism and its dependence upon military might in the arrangement of two resonant artifacts: an enlarged reproduction of a silk scarf worn by former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and an actual, used British Army blanket. Seeming to float breezily above the messy heap of the army blanket, the tablecloth-sized “scarf” in fact clings to the wall through static electricity—perhaps from contact with the woolen blanket below.  Like a standard waving within the battle lines, the scarf is both connected and disconnected from the activity beneath it, almost animated in its removal.  At the same time, the blanched, bunched blanket conveys an uneasy sense of having been used and discarded—perhaps like the bodies that went to war under Thatcher’s orders.",
