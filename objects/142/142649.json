  "text": "The hard angles that make up this woman's face, lines of her dress, and solid volume of her body show Charles Biederman's early flirtation with abstraction. Eventually he would eliminate all clear references to the natural, observed world, But here, depictung the portrait sitter with care and even tenderness, he adopted a strategy of reduction in order to streamline form and provide a new way of seeing a traditional subject.",
