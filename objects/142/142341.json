  "text": "The kimono-like silhouette of this garment along with the reverse applique method of construction were hallmarks of Tim Harding's wearable art coats. Each one of his creations were entirely handmade and one-of-a-kind. Repeating pyramid motifs in various hues of red, blue, and pink distinguish this Pyramid Coat from Harding's other wearable items. Both Tim Harding, and the donor who commissioned this work, Joanne Pollara, are from Minnesota.",
