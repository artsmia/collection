Each one of his creations were entirely handmade and one-of-a-kind. Repeating pyramid motifs in various hues of red, blue, and pink distinguish this \"Pyramid Coat\" from Harding's other wearable items. Both Tim Harding, and the donor who commissioned this work, Joanne Pollara, are from Minnesota.",
