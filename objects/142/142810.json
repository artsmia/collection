  "text": "Louis Legrand's art challenged the accepted sexual mores of Paris's polite society, and his use of materials could be—as here—equally unconventional. He used pastels in original ways, evident here in his scrawls, swirls, smudges, and mixing of colors. Searching for Legrand’s signature in the piece creates the impression that it is lost amidst his preoccupation with his young model. He sought subjects in the brothels of Paris, often depicting intimate moments in their lives. This pastel, executed in lurid pinks and blues with a slash of yellow, sets the woman aglow during a moment of rest.",
