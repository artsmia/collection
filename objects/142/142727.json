  "text": "A photograph of a pre-teen girl at the center of the photograph. The girl looks slightly to the right. Her arms and hands are close to her body. She wears brown shirt and skirt in fabric that has Asian-inspired motifs. Many necklace strands of off-white beads, long cylindrical bone pipes, and animal teeth fall to her waist. In the background are geometric designs made from white buttons and beads. The top and bottom designs are two large diamonds; a diamond shaped beaded design appears at the center of each diamond. Appearing below and above these designs are 3-5 rows of white beaded horizontal bands. Appearing below and above the beaded horizontal bands are round silver buttons in triangle shapes. Below and above these buttons are two more horizontal bands of 3-4 rows of beads. Between these two upper and lower horizontal bands are four larger buttons adorned with white and silver beads.\n",
