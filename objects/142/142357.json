  "text": "Multidisciplinary artist Diego Romero’s lithographs graphically illustrate central issues in Indigenous life, including colonization, sovereignty, and social and environmental justice and well-being. In most Indigenous communities, time does not follow a linear timeline but a cyclical one. Events that may have occurred in recent or more distant past are understood as being present and embodied in present day realities. Moreover, events that impact the environment are not understood as separate from the human realm, as all of living beings in the world, including land and water, are relatives, sentient beings that have rights and reciprocal relationships with all other beings on earth.\r\nIn American Diastrophism, Diego creates images of another brutal regime of the more recent past and the title reference environmental and social collapse through the extraction of oil within or within close proximity to Indigenous nations. He creates a scene of oil oozing onto the surface of the paper, with military fully armed with state-of-the art weaponry and an Indigenous water protector armed with a cellphone, bearing witness to the often violent treatment of protesters by corporate-sponsored security.",
