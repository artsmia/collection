  "text": "Mia’s collection of photography is particularly strong in the realm of photojournalism, including some of the most celebrated names of the 20th century, including Robert Capa, Gordon Parks, and Gilles Peress.  Works by female-identifying photojournalists, however, remain relatively few in number.  As a working photojournalist and editorial photographer based in Brooklyn, New York, Ina Jang reflects the changing nature of the field—from one predominantly white and male to one increasingly defined by the perspectives of young global citizens.  Although “A Walker” represents Jang’s fine art practice rather than her commercial or journalistic work, it distils the playful, slightly offbeat perspective she brings to the camera while conveying something perhaps more complicated: is the figure at the center of her composition in hiding, or being obstructed?",
