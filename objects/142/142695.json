  "text": "The circular format painting depicts a dozen older seated around an adolescent male haloed figure who sits above them on a pedestal. As the young man speaks and gestures with his right arm, the men listen intently, gesturing toward the speaker enthralled and rapt in attention, as well as quietlytalking amongst themselves. Many of the men wear turbans and have beards, and they wear an array of brightly colored drapery. The architectural setting is grand, with giant classical columns and billowing red drapery. Paper and books are scattered on the floor, some with Hebrew texts, suggesting the men have been studying. In the the background a veiled woman peeks at the group and atop colonnade in the distance two figures look on.",
