  "text": "Inspired by anatomy studies by artists ranging from Leonardo da Vinci in the Italian Renaissance to Thomas Eakins in 19th-century Philadelphia, Hyman Bloom drew at medical schools and hospital morgues starting in the mid 1940s. He found this access to the human body, inside and out, harrowing, awe-inspiring, and humbling. \"My concern,\" he explained, \"was the complexity and color beauty of the internal works, the wonder, and the feeling of transgressing boundaries which such curiosity evokes.\"",
