  "text": "Shot in one take while Heikes was finishing graduate school at Yale, So There’s This Pirate (2005), is a video that showed him as a stand-up comic, puppet in hand, telling a joke about a pirate and his obstinate parrot. The video follows the parrot’s refusal to obey its owner and the pirate’s resultant identity crisis, mimicking the artist’s constant evaluation of his own work. The premise of the film informed a number of artworks thereafter.",
