  "text": "In 1988 and 1980, The Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation commissioned Hopi artist and designer Ramona Sakiestewa to create a series of tapestries for Taliesin West in Phoenix, Arizona, now the home of the Frank Lloyd Wright School of Architecture and the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation. In Old Fashioned Window/2 Sakiestewa weaves a tapestry in the image of a stained-glassed window. The textile is filled with strong colors, geometric shapes, and symmetrical lines. Rich red and mustard yellow fields of color, crisp vertical and horizontal lines, and small colorful squares resemble the colors and shapes found in an early 20th century modernist stained-glass window. Sakiestewa created 12 textiles for the Foundation, working closely the Wright archives and drawing inspiration from Wright’s original drawings. The colors and bold geometric shapes are identifiable as Wright’s, and the tone of every strand of yarn was approved by a Taliesin color specialist. The result is a tapestry that resembles a work of art that would be commissioned by Wright himself.",
