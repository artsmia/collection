Using the reductive, naturalistic style typical of early 18th century Mughal portraiture, the artist, Hunhar II celebrates what seems to have been a not uncommon happening within enclosed zananas throughout India - cross-dressing was recorded at least since the time of Empress Nur Jahan  (1577-1645).",
