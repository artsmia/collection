  "text": "Leonard Freed was born in Brooklyn to Jewish parents of Eastern European descent. While he originally wanted to become a painter, he discovered photography while in the Netherlands. He captured the daily life of the people in the city and suburbs. In contrast to the photography that Freed is known for that explored societal violence and racial discrimination, his early work in Holland documented the innocence and decadence of the hard working post-war population.",
