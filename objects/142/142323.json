  "text": "Using geographic coordinates as titles to specify place, David Alekhuogie notes “Politics of identity are bound up in landscape.” The tightly framed figures are camouflaged by light, shadow and sharp-edged vegetation creating an ambiguous tension between vulnerability and aggression. Printed on canvas and pinned in shallow plywood boxes, the photographs are ultimately portraits of Alekhuogie’s hometown of Los Angeles with its tangled history of dreams and violence.",
