  "text": "This vase, one of a series for the Venini & Co. glass manufacturer, exemplifies the boldness of design and color typical of post–World War II Italian glass. It was one of several series for Venini by Fulvio Bianconi, the young Paduan illustrator-turned-designer who revitalized the firm during this period. The series is called pezzati, meaning spotted or patched, and the overlapping spots of vivid color that decorate this irregularly formed vase impart the feel of an abstract painting. \r\n\r\n",
