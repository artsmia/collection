  "text": "Regoyos was a Spanish painter who trained in Brussels, Belgium where he helped found the artists's society known as Les XX (Les Vingts). His painting style evolved from Naturalism to Impressionism and finally, Pointillism. Regoyos settled in the Basque region of Northern Spain. He preferred painting outdoor landscapes, working in an intentionally naïve style that is credited with introducing Impressionist techniques into Spanish painting.",
