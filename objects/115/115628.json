  "text": "The Counter-Reformation painter Camillo Procaccini was also an influential and innovative printmaker. He executed very few etchings-probably just six-over his lifetime, but the works are noteworthy for their ambition, bold technique, and scale. Saint Francis of Assisi Receiving the Stigmata is perhaps Procaccini's most accomplished etching. Executed in Milian in 1593, it is a powerful portrayal of Saint Francis' violent vision, combining compelling naturalistic detail with evocative spiritual mysticism. This particular impression is arguably the best surviving example of the rare print known today; it was formerly in the celebrated print collection of the Dukes of Devonshire (Chatsworth).",
