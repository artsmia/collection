  "text": "Swedish/German artist Ann Wolff entered the glass industry in the 1960s as a designer of household decorative items. In the 1970s, Wolff established Studio Stenhytta on the grounds of her home in Tranjo, Sweden. In the following decades, her work has emphasized, almost exclusively, all aspects of womanhood. Glass is a good medium for this because of its multidimensional nature, particularly in terms of its fragility and strength. As such, her pieces move beyond the mere materiality of glass to provoke intelligent interaction. While her pieces contain elements of narration, they often leave much of the meaning open to be interpreted by the viewer. In this untitled piece, Wolff does this very thing by portraying what could be understood as a narrative scene, that being the depiction of two women with a rabbit, without explicitly assigning any such meaning. Thus, this acid-etched scene displays the artist's more subliminally psychological exploration of what it means to live and think as a woman.",
