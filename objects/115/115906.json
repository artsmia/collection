  "text": "German artist Moje was the founding director and instructor at the Glass Workshop, Canberra School of Art in Canberra, Australia.  He helped revive murrine (mosaic) glass on a large, painterly scale. Instead of creating vessels, he has concentrated on shallow dish forms or square panels with vivid juxtapositions of color, taking fused glass to another, bolder level, and influencing younger generations working with glass fusing. The almost Abstract Expressionist handling of the fused and manipulated glass in diagonal patterns shows Moje's mastery of the medium, which ceases to resemble glass and becomes painterly in its composition.",
