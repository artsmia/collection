  "text": "This hanging is part of a set of four hanging scrolls that presents a landscape for each of the four seasons. Each scroll features a Chinese poem related to the relevant season, composed and brushed by the artist himself. Kodōjin and a handful of other artists carried the Nanga tradition into the 1900s, and his painting style is informed not only by famous painters from Chinese antiquity but also by earlier Japanese Nanga painters. Like other literati painters in East Asia, Kodōjin was not only a painter but also an accomplished scholar, poet, and calligrapher.",
