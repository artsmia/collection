Each work was meticulously executed. Color is applied for the blossoms in the spring landscape and for the foliage in the autumn landscape. In contrast, the summer landscape, which is in the style of the Chinese painter-calligrapher Mi Fu (Mi Fei, 1051–1107), one of the four greatest calligraphers of the Song dynasty (960–1279), and the winter landscape are both monochrome.",
