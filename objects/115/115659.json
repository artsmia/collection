  "text": "This brutal depiction of Christ crowned by thorns is one of the last works Annibale Carracci executed. The artist had recently suffered a catastrophic mental breakdown, from which he never fully recovered. In the last four years of his life, when he could no longer cope with large-scale painting commissions, he devoted himself almost exclusively to drawings and prints. The works he produced in this period are affecting and intimate, and seem to express the depths of his despair. In this etching, with delicate, vibrant lines, Annibale depicts Christ softly illuminating the darkness. Yet he is shown in a state of anguished desolation, as his cruel tormentors relish in their physical abuse of him.",
