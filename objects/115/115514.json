  "text": "The key element of the shrine of the Kono association of the Bamana people was a portable altar, often zoomorphic in shape, called a boli. Its awesome power derived from the manner in which it was made: animal bones and horns, vegetable matter, woven cloth, pieces of metal, and a wide range of other substances and materials were packed around a wooden framework sheltering a cotton doll. Over time, the boli was ritualistically covered with beeswax, animal blood, millet porridge, and earth from termite moundsâ€”accumulated layers that not only gave the boli its distinctively cracked appearance but also large quantities of potentially harmful vital energy.",
