Known for his candid photographs of everyday life around the globe, he wrote that “the camera is a sketch book, an instrument of intuition and spontaneity.” His photograph of a boy toting bottles of wine along a Parisian street provides immediate insight into the child’s impish good humor as he goes about an ordinary neighborhood errand.",
