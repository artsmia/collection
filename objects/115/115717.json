  "text": "According to the myth of Mercury—the Roman god of commerce, communication, and trickery—he was just a few days old when he stole a herd of cattle that belonged to Apollo. After killing one of the bulls, Mercury made strings of its guts, stretched them over a tortoise shell, and the lyre was born. Though initially angry with Mercury, Apollo forgave his crime in exchange for the new string instrument.",
