  "text": "Executed by Lucas Vorsterman after a design by Anthony van Dyck, this portrait depicts the 17th-century engraver, publisher, and print dealer Theodor Galle. The engraving is part of van Dyck's Iconography series, a collection of portrait prints after drawings and paintings by van Dyck that portray the illustrious men of the era. The sitters are princes, politicians, military commanders, statesman, scholars, artists, and collectors. Vorsterman, a prominent Flemish engraver active in the first-half of the 17th century, played an important role in the creation of this series, executing 22 of the original 80 plates. His skillful engraving technique is on display here, with his manipulation of the burin to evoke distinct textures-drapery, lace, flesh, and hair-and use of swelling and tapering lines to convincingly model the form.
