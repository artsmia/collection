  "text": "This album of snapshots by Oregon-based photographer Maxwell Allara provides a first-hand view into Minor White’s outdoor camera work. Through a series of pictures showing White tinkering with lenses and positioning his tripod along a rocky beach, the viewer gains insight into the careful methods by which White pursued iconic images of the natural world. It also reveals something of the character of the man behind the camera: from his rumpled khakis to his black-rimmed glasses, White is an unassuming presence, his energy entirely directed toward his craft.",
