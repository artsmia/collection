The neckline, front chest area, and upper back are embroidered in yellow, orange, mint green, blue, tan, and black. The meaning of the four elongated motifs on the front is unclear: while they may be abstract designs, it is also possible that they represent plants and their rootsâ€”maybe the ubiquitous millet or sorghum, both essential to Fulani cuisine.",
