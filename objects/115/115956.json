  "text": "Clayman chose cast glass (molded glass frit, not poured) as his way of exploring the monolithic and semi-opaque qualities of glass while at the Rhode Island School of Design, an important center for experimentation in the medium. This untitled cast glass sculpture has various references-perhaps to ancient tools or memorials, or not-so-ancient tools, such as early 20th century flat irons. These so-called \"handled\" early works share a reference to function while gaining graphic definition through copper wire wrapping the form.",
