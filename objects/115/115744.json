  "text": "This large pendant from the West African Mende peoples characterized by the stepped design of concentric rectangles, closely resembles Islamic amulets found in Northern Africa. In fact, people in Sierra Leone have worn such amulets for centuries. This pendant was made about a hundred years ago from silver obtained by melting coins, and it was worn as a status symbol by a high-ranking official of the female Sande Society. This association oversees the initiation of girls into adulthood, instilling notions of morality and proper conduct; it remains invested in the well-being of its members throughout their lives, promoting womenâ€™s social and political interests.",
