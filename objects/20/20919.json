  "text": "Although this painting has no recognizable imagery, George Morrison described it as an \"urban landscape.\" He painted it in Dayton, Ohio where he started teaching in 1960 after spending over a decade in New York. According to Morrison he painted it spontaneously over about six hours in a single night, exploring the possibilities of paint to suggest images rather than depict tangible things. \"I was trying to capture an inner thing,” he recalled, “where you began with the act of painting itself, then images began to emerge. Almost like subconscious painting.\" Recent conservation of this painting was made possible by Paula Vesely, through the Adopt-a-Painting program.",
