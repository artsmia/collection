  "text": "In 1960, George Morrison was at the forefront of Abstract Expressionism, experimenting with materials and subject matter like other artists of the New York School. He was Native American, and he was in the midst of the most avant-garde art scene of the time. Morrison didn’t limit himself to the expectations of others about what Native art should encompass in subject matter or design. In paintings like this one, Morrison experimented with thickly applied paint to create raised, even sculptural, surfaces—which was possible due to the introduction of quick-drying acrylic paints in the 1960s.\r\n\r\nConservation of this picture was made possible by a generous contribution from Paula Vesely through the Art Champions program.",
