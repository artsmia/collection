  "text": "During the summer of 1969, Joseph Jachna taught a class at the Peninsula School of Art in Door County, Wisconsin. While there, he started experimenting with a new wide-angle lens on his camera. He found ways of making “new configurations” of outdoor spaces. In Door County, Wisconsin, for instance, Jachna’s hand hovers at center, holding a mirror that both reveals and conceals part of the landscape.",
