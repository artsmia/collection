  "text": "Linda Rich produced this portfolio while a student at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. Each photograph documents a space of pampering in the pursuit of beauty, from arrival to completed visit. One recurring item is the mirror.  Here, for instance, Rich has positioned a masked woman in curlers at center. Scenes from the salon activities appear in mirrors reflected within other looking glasses, including Rich as she interacts with her sitter.\r\n\r\nPhoto reproduction (detail) of James Barnor’s Self-Portrait with a Store Assistant at the West African Drug Company, 1952 (printed 2023), The Walter McCarthy and Clara Ueland  Endowment for Photographs and gift of funds from an  anonymous donor",
