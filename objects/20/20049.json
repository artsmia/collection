  "text": "Although Lee Friedlander often appears in his photographs, early on in his career he seemed surprised to do so. However, his presence in Filling Station, Rearview Mirror, Hillcrest, New York seems far from accidental.  Friedlander carefully positioned the camera so as to focus on the mirror, even if only to include part of his face.",
