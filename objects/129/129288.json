  "text": "“Without Bacchus and Ceres, Venus Freezes” is an allegory that can be interpreted as “Without wine and food, love freezes.” Here we see Bacchus and Ceres, the god and goddess of wine and agricultural fertility, embracing Venus, goddess of love, helping to keep her warm. The infant god of love, Cupid, reaches up to pluck a grape. The allegory derives from a line in an ancient Roman comedy written by Terence, who lived in the 100s BCE. The sensuosity of this image contrasts sharply with the verses, which warn against excessive consumption of food and drink as a gateway to libidinous activity.\r\n\r\nThe dazzling engraving technique features swelling and tapering lines curving and crisscrossing to render broad tonal ranges and stark contrasts of darkness and light that bring forth palpably fleshy forms.",
