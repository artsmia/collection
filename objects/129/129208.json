  "text": "Akinaga Kunihiro studied at Osaka University of Arts with the intention of becoming a product designer. His family operated a metal factory creating precision parts for airplanes etc. and he grew up seeing the lathe machines needed for forming the metal. Akinaga concentrates solely on clay sculptures and began using black glaze in 2001. Since 2011 he has been creating an inventive and scientific series of black ceramic sculptures that he collectively calls “Mimicry.” In an attempt to capture the world between life and death, he reduces the animals to their bones but adds subtle decorations inspired by ornamental architectural elements on temples and churches because he wants to avoid that “the truth of things gets hidden.” This sculpture is that of a Japanese macaque, also known as “snow monkey,” who is standing and lifting his proper left arm above his head, expressing both a sense of life and death. Each bone is hand-built and only in the lower half of the spine is a metal rod inserted to increase stability.",
