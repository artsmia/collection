  "text": "Native Americans on Horseback shows a band of seven or more men on galloping horseback in a wide open landscape with scrubby bushes dotted on the sunbaked earth. They carry spears, some decorated, and wear different headdresses. The lead horseman’s bonnet sports numerous eagle feathers, while the others have a few or no feathers. Apart from sashes or ornaments they are bare to the waist. Two of the most high-ranking riders wear leggings, and both have round shields with thunderbird bosses at the center. While urgency is evident in the image, destination and purpose are not.",
