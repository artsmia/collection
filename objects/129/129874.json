  "text": "Inka Essenhigh’s work explores fantastic, surreal visions that are rooted in everyday sites and experiences. Often taking inspiration from her surrounding environment—predominantly New York City and rural Maine—these settings find their way into the artist’s consciousness, manifesting themselves as allegorical images. Ghosts, gods and monsters find their way into mundane spaces, like that of a busy apartment hallway as seen in Monsters of Manhattan. The artist’s hallmark use of fluid, sinuous outlines to define these anthropomorphic figures endows these specters with a frenzied energy that is indicative of our hurried, multitasked lives.",
