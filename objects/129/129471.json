  "text": "This layered image in which we see both a close-up of a woman holding a pair of scissors and a broader view of a bar interior is typical of the compositions of David Salle. The double-exposure effect prompts us to contend with two reactions at once—one to a confrontational image and one to an image where we have to tease out the subject and any narrative. Salle made this color woodcut in conjunction with a team of Japanese woodcut craftsmen who were brought together in 1982 by publisher Crown Point Press for the purpose of collaborating with artists from the Western tradition.",
