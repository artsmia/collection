  "text": "A large, horizontal color field painting in stained and pooled areas of pink, peach, yellow and white. Atop this colorful background are spray-painted stencils of the various continents including Africa, Australia, as well as North and South America that are situated across the canvas to resemble a world map. The continent of Africa appears twice—once on the far left, and again in the middle of the composition. In the lower left of the composition there are large areas of fluid-like pools of pigment that create a diaphanous, puddle-like appearance. This leads to vertical areas of blue and purple pigment that appear to stain and permeate the canvas.",
