  "text": "In \"False Start\", Frank Bowling maps an expansive yet intimate geography that charts his path from Bartica, Guyana, to London and New York. Rejecting the graphic formalism of pure abstraction, his Map Paintings (1967–71) contain references to postcolonialism—the social and political power relationships that sustained colonialism—his own Afro-Caribbean roots, and the broader African diaspora. The composition of False Start features prominent outlines of the continents of the Southern Hemisphere—Africa, Australia, and South America—rendered in tones of white and pink. Through its omission of Europe, the image challenges Eurocentric historical narratives while drawing attention to the expansive footprint of colonialism and imperialism.",
