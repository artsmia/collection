  "text": "During the Qing dynasty, members of the elite who gained fame for their calligraphy were often equally famous for their achievements in officialdom. Within elite society, calligraphy was admired even more than painting. It was viewed as quintessential yet functional, rather than as merely an independent visual art form or means of self-expression and cultivation. Indeed, among the aspiring upwardly mobile, calligraphy became almost an obsession. More than at any other time in Chinese history, calligraphy became inextricably bound with class and status, the social and the official.",
