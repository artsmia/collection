  "text": "Nicolas Africano is a contemporary figurative artist best known for his enigmatic drawings, paintings, and cast glass sculptures of female figures modeled after his wife Rebecca. This drawing is part of a recent body of work comprising large-scale graphite drawings and cast glass sculptures portraying the American actress Greta Garbo (1905-1990) in the role of Pierrot the Clown, a comically tragic character from Italian commedia dell’arte, a popular form of improvised comic theater. Using Rebecca (“R”) as his model, Africano based the pose and costume of his figure on photographs taken in 1939 by society photographer Cecil Beaton of Garbo dressed as Pierrot. In a journal entry, Africano alluded to desire to make art with emotionally evocative content: “I am poised, still, at a threshold,” at “that moment between innocence and experience.”",
