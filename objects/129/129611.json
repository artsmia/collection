  "text": "A full-length portrait photograph of a woman of African descent, seated, wearing a short-sleeved, ankle-length, white dress against a grey-black background. The woman is positioned in partial profile, with her back turned partly away from the photographer. She turns her head to look over her right shoulder, her forearms neatly crossed in her lap, in an attitude of self-possession. The tiers of her immaculate dress cascade from her narrow waist, and the back of the dress curved down to show an expanse of her slender, brown shoulders and graceful neck. With short, white hair framing her brow, the woman casts a direct, appraising eye upon the viewer, at once calm and dignified as she returns their gaze.",
