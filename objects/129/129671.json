  "text": "Sam Gilliam is a leading figure of the Color Field movement that emerged in New York in the 1950s and later flourished in Washington, D.C., where he has lived and worked since 1962. The large color stained canvases that he draped and suspended from walls and ceilings were groundbreaking when first introduced in 1965. For the next decade, Gilliam explored unconventional forms of painting and drawing that featured a third dimension as a way to bridge the gap between painting and sculpture. This watercolor of 1971 is an exceptional example of Gilliam’s experimental approach, blending abstract color staining with an intentionally altered paper substrate. The crumbled paper transforms the work from two dimensions to three, adding a distinctive sculptural quality.",
