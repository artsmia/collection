  "text": "In this richly-colored, half-length image, a seated woman in a striped jacket embraces a young child who stands on the skirt covering her left thigh. The women faces away from the viewer in lost profile. Her face is near that of the child who looks to our right. The stripes on the woman’s jacket have jagged edges produced by deft masking of aquatint grounds with the artist’s brush. The artist has applied a rich variety of colors to the printing plates with a dauber—sometimes with tight control as in the child’s hair and sometimes with great, painterly freedom as in the background.",
