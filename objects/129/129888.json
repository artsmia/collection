  "text": "Metal currency predates minted coinage in Africa by many centuries. Iron was a precious, hard to come by material, and in many African languages the word for “iron” and for “money” is one and the same. This very large blade looks like a spearhead, but its makers, the Topoke from Central Africa, did not use it as a weapon. It served in important transactions, including land deals, payment of fines, and marriage compensation offered to the family of the bride.",
