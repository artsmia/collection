  "text": "Sheila Metzner celebrates the beauty of the human form in a dramatically lighted photograph of actress Uma Thurman in a designer dress. The fabric of the dress gathers around her curves and emphasizes the sculptural qualities of her figure. At the same time, the photograph contains a sly joke: the actress poses next to a statue that looks like an exclamation point turned upside-down, as if the scene is responding enthusiastically to the model’s beauty.",
