  "text": "This quilt is composed in the “Tumbling Blocks” pattern, one commonly used for American quilts in the latter 19th and early 20th centuries. Though it was probably used before, the earliest publication of the pattern in the US goes back to an 1851 edition of Godey’s Lady’s Book. The basic pattern elements are squares and diamond shapes; when these are arranged in highly contrasting colors a dramatic three dimensional “cube” effect results. The pattern is sometimes also called “Baby’s Blocks.”",
