  "text": "The Miao are one of China’s largest ethnic minority groups, scattered among several provinces, but mostly living in Guizhou/Yunnan plateau. They are famous for their embroidery skills and indigo dyeing techniques, and for the central role of textiles and jewelry play in their culture. Styles of Miao costume are diverse among the culture’s various sub-groups. A popular saying states “If you meet one hundred Miaos, you will see one hundred costumes.”",
