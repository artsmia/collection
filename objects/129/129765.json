  "text": "Saul Steinberg loved the crowded streets of New York City. This is a one-way street; all the cars are coming at us. Oddly enough, all the anonymous stick figures also head in the same direction, something pretty unusual in New York. In sharp contrast to the spare stick figures, the cars are baroque confections in chromium from the era when auto manufacturers vied for the gaudiest ornamentation. The building facades reflect the decorative flourishes of an earlier generation.",
