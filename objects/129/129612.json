  "text": "Giulia Dall’Olio takes inspiration from natural forms and the spaces between them. Sometimes, as in the enigmatically titled g 19][73 d, she divorces the forms from their surroundings. This drawing presents a tree—or perhaps the ghost of one. The image is as much erased as it is drawn. Much of the drawing’s weight lies in the dark voids between the leaves and branches. The artist has further removed us from immediate contact with the subject by smearing the image so that it seems to melt or run like paint or stand behind wet glass. The symmetry of this particular study gives it somewhat the appearance of an atomic mushroom cloud. Perhaps that is not far-fetched, for in distancing us from the material physicality of the tree, Dall’Olio has brought our attention to the phenomenal life force within it.",
