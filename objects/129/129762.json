  "text": "Do you have special ways of holding your head for a selfie' Here we see Saul Steinberg thinking about how to present himself. With a small, quick sketch and a larger, more considered study, he tried out several variations. He seems to have been especially concerned with the size of his ears and the position of his eyes. He also fussed over the contour of his scalp, perhaps in an effort to make his face protrude more forcefully.",
