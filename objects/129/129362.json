  "text": "The title I Was a Hidden Treasure, Then I Wanted to Be Known . . . comes from the hadith qudsi, or “sacred sayings,” a narrative record of the words and actions of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. This passage refers to the motivation behind the divine creation of humankind. It can also describe the deep desire of each of us to be known and loved by one another. Embellished with fabric, metal, beads, rope and tassels, the tapestry acts as a symbolic veil for the artist Igshaan Adams’s own unearthing of his true identity. It is also an invitation for viewers to remove their own symbolic veils in order to discover their true selves. Initially I grappled with deconstructing my hybrid identity, focusing on my multicultural, religious, and sexual identities in relation to the domestic and political environments in which they were formed, hoping to understand the conflict I was experiencing. My focus has since shifted to wanting to know more about the self from a multidimensional, universal, and mystical position. —Igshaan Adams, 2017",
