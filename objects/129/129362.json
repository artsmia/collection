  "text": "The tapestry, I Was A Hidden Treasure, Then I Wanted To Be Known... resembles a camouflaged terrain, or perhaps an abstracted tree canopy. The work’s title comes from a well-known hadith qudsi, or extra-Quranic record of the words, actions and the silent approval of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. This passage originally references the motivation behind the divine creation of humankind but can also describe the deep desire for each of us to be known and loved by one another. Embellished with the fabric, metal, beads, rope and tassel, the tapestry acts as a symbolic veil for Adams’ own unearthing of his true identity as well as an invitation for the viewer to remove their own veils in order to discover their true selves.",
