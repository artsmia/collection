  "text": "Among the most spectacular traditional means of payment from the African continent are these long blades once used by the Topoke and Lokele peoples and their neighboring communities in northern Congo. The blades look like spearheads, but their makers did not employ them as weapons. They served in important transactions, including land deals, payment of fines, and marriage compensations offered to the family of the bride.",
