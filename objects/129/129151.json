  "text": "To create her paintings, artist Avery Singer first intricately constructs digital models using the 3D modeling program SketchUp. With these architectural drawings, the artist sketches her compositions on canvases using masking tape and an airbrush creating images that are both digital and analog. Her tableaux are often populated with androgynous, robot-like figures whose geometric, faceted forms echo those of Cubism and the work of Russian constructivists like Naum Gabo (Russian, 1890-1977). Amid the complex overlapping patterns and angular planes that make up the work Untitled is a camouflaged beret-wearing figure with accordion-like locks of ribbon-plaited hair.",
