  "text": "Ruthann Godollei’s monotype is part of the centuries-long tradition of using the graphic arts as a vehicle for political and social commentary. Though various interpretations are possible, this one-of-a-kind print seems to imply that technology is not infallible and that modern society’s propensity for throw-away consumer products is ultimately unsustainable. The print’s title—He Couldn’t Fix It—is perhaps ironic, suggesting that the very act of attempting to repair an electronic device is an antiquated concept.",
