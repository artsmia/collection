  "text": "This sweater vest was hand knit by Mary Hillier [Thompson] for David Ryan, former Minneapolis Institute of Art (Mia) curator of decorative arts and design. Mary is the sister of curator Bevis Hillier, who co-organized an Art Deco exhibition at Mia in 1971 with Ryan. Prompted by the exhibition catalogue cover (designed by London graphic arts firm Bentley/Farrell/Burnett), Hillier knit two sweaters, one for her brother, Bevis, and one for Ryan to wear at the Art Deco exhibition preview and public opening.\r\n\r\n[Caption] Book cover, The World of Art Deco, 1971",
