  "text": "Keisai Eisen's powerful and dynamic style is most apparent in his prints featuring scenes of martial valor. This book illustrates seventeen great warriors from Japan's medieval era. Fantastic legends about them were adapted to the Kabuki stage during the Edo period. This scene depicts the 14th century warrior O_mori Hikoshichi fighting with demons. As a retainer of the great warlord Ashikaga Takauji (1305-1358), Hikoshichi joined the rebellion against emperor Godaigo and ultimately cornered and killed his fiercest general, Kusunoki Masashige (1294-1336). After the battle, Hikoshichi discovers Masashige's ghost has returned to haunt him. The malevolent spirit first appears as a beautiful woman who transforms into a witch (shown here in the lower right corner). Later, at night, it changes into a giant spider and again attacks Hikoshichi.",
