  "text": "For New Year's, the Japanese decorate cut bare branches with small balls of glutinous rice (mochi), which they think resembles plum blossoms, a harbinger of spring. In this rather earthy view of the holiday, Rosetsu has pictured a pack of mice devouring the delicate \"flowers.\" \r\nRosetsu, an exuberant and expressive ink painter, also excelled at working in an extremely detailed and refined manner. In this scroll, he displays his skill at kegaki, the technique of painting countless lines over a light wash to realistically portray the fur's soft, undulating texture. In addition, Rosetsu had an uncanny understanding of animals. Here, he deftly captured the nature of mice through their tense, delicate gestures and quick, dark eyes.",
