  "text": "Best known for his prints and picture books featuring <I>kyōka<I> poems, Yashima Gakutei, a print artist and novelist, was well known within Edo's literary circles. In the preface of this book, he reveals his inspiration by mentioning a picture book by Katsushika Hokusai that shows artisans and people in various professions. Gakutei, however, used his literary connections and called on his fellow poets to compose poems related to the various professions that were commonly seen in Edo. This double page depicts four occupations, including a sedge hat maker, a gilder, a scroll mounter, and a lacquerware artisan.",
