  "text": "There are two extremes to Apsaalooka beadwork; highly or minimally decorated items. Most beaded objects are highly decorated, with fields of color over its entire surface.\r\n\r\nBut the Apsaalooka are the masters of creating elegant minimally decorated items. The multi-colored beaded bars on these bags give the illusion of an entirely beaded surface. The repeated pattern, both vertically and horizontally create a well-balanced and symmetrical surface.",
