  "text": "Chinese potters wedged together different colors of clay to create ceramics with interesting color variations. Known as neriage or nerikomi in Japanese, this technique has been revived by Japanese contemporary potters. Self-taught potter Ogata Kamiō lives in Shinshinotsu Village on Japan's northernmost island, Hokkaidō. His contribution to the neriage technique is to combine shades of clay in such a way as to create the visual perception of movement.",
