  "text": "In the Lao-Tai culture bed linens form an important part of a woman's dowry. A prospective bride was expected to prepare as many as ten sets of mattresses, pillows and blankets, and one mosquito net  prior to the wedding.  Although the bride weaves most of these items herself, other family members may assist her if the dowry is unusually large.\r\n\r\nGeometric designs, hook-shaped motifs and lozenges provide the basic imagery for bed furnishings, but birds, animals and mythological creatures appear frequently as well. This blanket features two bands of monkeys prancing along the perimeter of each diamond shape.",
