  "text": "The Lotus Sutra (Saddharmapundarika: The Lotus of the True Doctrine) was among the earliest texts to reach China from India and became extremely popular among Buddhists there. Paying particular attention to Avalokitesvara (Chinese: Guanyin), the Lotus Sutra is basically a restatement of the ways and practices of a bodhisattva. The calligraphy is beautifully executed in well-balanced kaishu regular script, and the illuminated frontispiece and end piece are meticulously painted with a colorful and stylized dragon motif.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of dragons on Chinese Buddhist sutras demonstrates how foreign faiths and religions were adopted into Chinese cultureâ€”with adaptations that made them less foreign. The appearance of dragons on Buddhist sutras at this time also suggests imperial patronage or preference for Buddhism.",
