  "text": "Matsuo Jun’s educational path exemplifies the eclectic training enjoyed by contemporary Japanese potters. Although he is the son of the porcelain ceramist Matsuo Shigetoshi, he opted to attend Saga Junior Art College and then apprenticed with Kyoto potter Iwabuchi Shigeya. He then worked at his father’s kiln from 1985 until 1991 before establishing his own kiln in Takeo in Saga prefecture. For this vessel, based on the shape of a traditional wooden bucket, Matsuo used unglazed clay in a manner closely akin to Bizen or Tokoname ware.",
