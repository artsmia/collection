  "text": "In this etching’s early states, Bracquemond was faithful to the preparatory drawing (Mia 24.36) and the motif of an impending downpour. But he kept embellishing the storm, eventually making the sky so dark that it became unworkable. By this late version of the etching—here printed on warm-toned Japanese paper—he had removed the sky and started over, drastically altering the mood and turning the stage over to his geese.",
