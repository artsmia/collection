  "text": "To the contemporary viewer this meticulous plan of the grounds at Chiswick in west London appears extremely formal, but in the early 18-century Chiswick represented a shift towards a new, more natural-looking garden.  The gardens feature curving pathways and picturesque views highlighted by an artificially constructed river and carefully placed statuary and architectural details. Although the complete product of human design, the more informal gardens at Chiswick gave birth to the English landscape movement.",
