  "text": "The way these swallows are positioned on the surface of the sheet, disconnected from the background—one even breaching the picture’s border—shows the profound influence Japanese woodcuts had on Bracquemond. The foreshortening, bird’s-eye view, and high horizon line also reflect Japanese design.\r\n\r\nJaponisme, the craze for all things Japanese that swept Paris in the 1800s, originated largely with Bracquemond. While visiting the shop of the printer Auguste Delâtre in 1856, he noticed some unusual packing material in a crate of porcelain from Japan. It was pages from Katsushika Hokusai’s Manga (Sketchbooks), a series of woodcut designs printed as a kind of instruction book for aspiring artists. Bracquemond secured a copy and showed it to as many artist friends as he could. His enthusiasm helped redefine French art in the second half of the 1800s.",
