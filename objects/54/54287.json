  "text": "Lucas's conception of the theme of the temptation of St. Anthony breaks dramatically with the traditional iconography. Typically, St. Anthony born in Egypt to a weathly Christian family renounced his inheritance and left his home to become a hermit. Lucas's contemporaries created phantasmogorical depictions of hideous demons tormenting the saint to succumb to the temptation of the devil. Instead, the artist represents Anthony resisting a female personification of the devil who entices him with a jar and prepares to disrobe. Anthony places one hand on the bible and gestures with the other to ward off Satan.\u000b\u000bThe intricate landscape with trees, foliage, rocks and buildings is characteristic of Lucas's compositions circa 1510.",
