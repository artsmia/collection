  "text": "The young princess Danaë was locked in a bronze tower by her father, the king of Argos, to keep out suitors because an oracle had foretold that the king would be killed by his daughter's son. The Roman god Jupiter cleverly visited Danaë in the form of a golden shower, leaving her pregnant. Despite the king's efforts, fate prevails; his daughter gives birth to a boy, Perseus, who would accidentally slay his grandfather with a discus.",
