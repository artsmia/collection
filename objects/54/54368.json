  "text": "A perceptive observer of life in Paris and rural France, Félix Buhot was dismayed by the plight of draft horses laboring in the city’s cold, wet winters. Using a compositional technique he called “symphonic margins,” he elaborated on this scene of a bustling Paris street with a series of vignettes revealing the darker, often hidden side of urban life. The commonplace title Winter in Paris belies Buhot’s critical commentary on animal abuse and neglect. The average lifespan of a commercial draft horse at the time was only four years. Thousands of dead horses were removed from the streets of Paris every year.",
