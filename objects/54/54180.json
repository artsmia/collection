  "text": "Bracquemond reportedly kept moles in a terrarium, but those weren’t the models for this print. Rather, the artist found a stick with ten dead moles attached and took it home to depict in an etching. Clearly he delighted in the lifeless shapes, which recall the silhouetted Japanese designs he admired. The verse can be translated as “The hanged mole dances / On the poplar’s arm / The mole-catcher prances / To get a reward from the farm.”\r\n\r\nThe Moles was printed by Auguste Delâtre, the most sought-after printer of the era. Even so, Bracquemond wanted control over every impression. In 1856, having finally convinced a wary French government that he would not print political caricatures, he was granted permission to buy his own press.",
