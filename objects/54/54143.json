  "text": "Against a backdrop of crumbling opulence, a monkey convinces a cat to grab roasting chestnuts from the fire for him. The monkey keeps eating, and the cat continues to retrieve chestnuts and burn its paws. It’s the tale of a clever creature using a vulnerable one to achieve his own selfish ends.\r\n\r\nThe Monkey and the Cat is one of six prints Bracquemond copied after watercolors by his contemporary Gustave Moreau. Each illustrates a fable by the 17th-century writer Jean de La Fontaine. Translating other artists’ work into etching paid more than original etchings and helped Bracquemond make a living. This etching was published in a Parisian book of fables.",
