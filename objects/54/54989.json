  "text": "Napoleon seized power in France in 1799 and was crowned emperor in 1804. He was depicted in his coronation robes in his official portrait by François Gérard—the same painter of King Louis-Philippe’s portrait displayed at left. Gérard’s workshop produced numerous copies of Napoleon’s portrait for government offices and embassies abroad, but the emperor wished for the image to circulate more broadly. He thus commissioned a print—this large, accomplished engraving by Auguste Desnoyers, which took four years to complete. The majestic setting and Napoleon’s stance and attributes—the imperial throne, ermine and fleur-de-lys robes, scepter, and hand of justice—imitate a famous print, identical in size, of Louis XVI, made in 1790, two years before the king’s beheading.",
