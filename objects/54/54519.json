  "text": "Myers's eccentric interpretation of Albrecht Dürer's master engraving of the same subject is a raucous amalgam of unconventional pictorial representations and experimental printing methods. Here, subjectivity and emotion replace observation and rational thought. Myers uses dynamic line, vivid color, and distinctive textural contrasts to create a highly personal version of Dürer's Christian knight, the embodiment of moral virtue, riding undistracted past the specters of death and the devil, staying true to his mission.",
