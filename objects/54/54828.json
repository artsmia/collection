  "text": "The sculptor Elizabeth Frink related to the hyper-alert nature of predatory birds. She grew up in Suffock, England, during World War II, near an airfield that saw its share of German bombs. For her, birds of prey conveyed feelings of “panic, tension, aggression.” Frink’s precisely etched lines contribute to a sort of skittish vigilance, the osprey scouting for a safe place to tear into its fish and the honey buzzard scanning for its staple food: wasps.",
