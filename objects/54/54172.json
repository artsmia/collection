  "text": "Bracquemond couldn’t resist giving his birds human characteristics, a great source of their charm. Surprised Ducks is the most extreme example. Three ducks seem to confer about a bather intruding in their pond, and she in turn is embarrassed by their stares. The bird at right appears to lower his eyelid and purse his bill in annoyance. The nude, a rare human presence in Bracquemond’s work, is modeled in flicks and hatches that make her seem to glow.",
