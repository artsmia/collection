  "text": "Architect Michael Graves has become something of a celebrity through his partnership with Target Corporation.  Today, they number into the hundreds, ranging from toilet bowl brushes to tuxedo studs.  In this wall clock, Graves has combined simple, geometric forms with Postmodern details in the form of exaggerated cut-out Arabic numerals.  Shedding the long-standing conventions of functionalism, Graves has inserted his witty, learned, playful (and signed) elements.",
