Volume Two contains 80 double-page color screenprints loosely inserted into a series of paper folders. They are arranged to show the effects a range of colours have on each other. Together with these is a 48-page bound 'Commentary' book in plain black wraps. Among the 'authors' of the screenprints is the US poet Mark Strand, a pupil of Albers who contributes two prints. The two volumes are also bound in dark brown textured cloth.",

  "text": "Based on the principle that human perception of color is a relative concept, Josef Alber's \"Interaction of Color\" has become a standard text for many art and design schools. Featuring Alber's theoretical writings on color, this rare first edition of the publication features 150 color screenprints that demonstrate such principles as color relativity, intensity, and temperature; vibrating and vanishing boundaries; and the illusions of transparency and reversed grounds. The color plates were printed at the firm of Ives-Sillman in New Haven, Conn., who were frequent collaborators on Albers's various print publications.",
