Volume Two contains 80 double-page color screenprints loosely inserted into a series of paper folders. They are arranged to show the effects a range of colours have on each other. Together with these is a 48-page bound 'Commentary' book in plain black wraps. Among the 'authors' of the screenprints is the US poet Mark Strand, a pupil of Albers who contributes two prints. The two volumes are also bound in dark brown textured cloth.",
