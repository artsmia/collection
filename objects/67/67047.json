  "text": "In the late 1950s, Russel Wright contracted with Ideal Toy Co. to produce a child's version of his American Modern line in plastic, so small cooks could have their own Wright set, just like Mother's.  Smaller replicas of the ceramic version, they were identical in shape and color.  Sears was one of the retailers offering the set through its Christmas catalogues.",
