  "text": "Takasago Uraemon (died 1829) fought under this name from 1809 until 1821, after which he became Tegarayama Shigeemon for one last tournament before his retirement. In this portrait, made around 1810, Takasago is dressed like a samurai, carrying two swords. Only samurai were allowed to carry swords, but as some wrestlers were retained by lords, they could too. Hence this portrait shows Takasago’s important and powerful status.",
