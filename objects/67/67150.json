When he was grown up, he noticed that most British pots were poorly made. He was determined to create pottery of good quality in Britain. After long and hard work, he finally established his own way to make them. The Wedgewood pottery brought a huge wealth to Britain. It is believed that his disability made him a great art creator.)",
