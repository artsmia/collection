  "text": "This fine ivory hat stand has curved legs that have been pierced and carved as archaic dragons. The central boss is decorated with three incised shou (long life) characters surrounded by a cap also carved with a shou character. Made to accompany a traveling scholar official, this stand is cleverly disguised with legs that lock in position by the bayonet fitting on the cap to provide a wide and stable stand for the hat. It is also dismountable to pack flat for safe traveling.",
