  "text": "These paintings were once part of a much larger composition—now dispersed among several collections in the United States—that originally formed the wall of a temple in north-central China, possibly Cishengsi in far northern Henan province. All together the set depicts a trio of seated bodhisattvas. Each one is flanked by standing attendant bodhisattvas and surrounded by other attendants performing rituals. They are also accompanied by flying celestials (apsara) in a paradise-like setting based on Esoteric Buddhist teachings. The seated bodhisattva here, originally the leftmost of the three primary figures, is backed by a halo and wears elaborate robes and jewelry. In his large crown is a small depiction of a buddha, the superior being from which the bodhisattva emanated. \r\n \r\n",
