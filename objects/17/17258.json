  "text": "The double-headed snake is a common image throughout ancient traditional beliefs, from the Pacific Coast to the Andes. In this example, the jaguar appears around the neck of the vase in profile, and complements the serpent imagery. Both the snake and the jaguar were encountered in sacred journeys, and were important symbols of shamanic visions and power. This object successfully unites two sacred animals important to traditional beliefs.  ",
