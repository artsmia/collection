  "text": "The double headed snake is a common image throughout ancient traditional beliefs spanning from the Pacific Coast to the Andes of South America. This object successfully unites two sacred animals important to traditional Nasca beliefs. Here, the profile of a jaguar appears around the neck of the container to complement the serpent imagery. To the Nasca people, the snake and the jaguar, both important symbols of shamanic visions and power, were encountered in sacred journeys.",
