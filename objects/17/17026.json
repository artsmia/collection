  "text": "This <I>chang-fu</I> robe displays the standard formal arrangement of eight medallions set against a solid color ground. Each of the multicolored medallions contains a crane rounded in the center, surrounded by seasonal flowers (lotus, plum, magnolia, peony, and chrysanthemum). The neck and sleeve bands, as well as the cuffs, are decorated with multicolored crane roundels and seasonal flowers matching the body. The crane stands for long life, the flowers for purity, beauty, wealth and honor, as well as the four seasons. The red ground was an appropriate color for festive occasions like weddings and birthday celebrations.",
