The square face, projecting from the surface, has nose, eyeballs, and rectangular mouth in relief.  The god wears an elaborate headdress with a projecting border of puma heads.  The headdress and face, including a line of stylized tear drops falling from each eye, are painted in black, brick red, cream, and buff on a ground of darker red.  The back of the jar is decorated with four vertical rows of crudely drawn heads in profile painted in brick red and buff.  Design and workmanship primitive.  Jar restored.",
