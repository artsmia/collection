  "description": "Court robe of medium blue satin brocade with nine 5-clawed dragons, those in profile grasping the Heavenly Jewel. Scattered in the field are loose clouds and bats in shades of blue, green, rose, red, yellow and brown. Conventional border of wavy, slightly slanting stripes; tight clouds; rolling waves in which appear Buddhist symbols, coral, swastikas and emblems of the Eight Precious Things. No border on sleeves, but a single peony blossom above the strip of dark blue, corded satin. Cuffs and collar band of dark blue satin brocade in body designs. Edging of blue and gold brocade. Lining of thin blue floral damask. The striped area of this border very reminiscent of Kang Hsi.",
