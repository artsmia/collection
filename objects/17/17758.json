  "description": "The decor of these head-turning beasts includes bands of scales- which may represent a Huai corruption of an early dragon motif- granulation on the snout, around the eyes, and in the spiral of a raised comma pattern on the shoulders and haunches. Just above the tufts of the front legs are three striated lead-forms that appear to be feathers. Patina green and greyed-green.",
