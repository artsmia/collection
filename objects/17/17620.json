  "description": "Between the slanting eyes, framed by striated bands, is  a ridge with scales that terminates in a pointed forehead.  The scales are repeated on  the inward curving horns, on the ear-like projections, and on one tusk (the second tusk is missing).  The eyeballs are in the form of raised knobs with hollow centers.  Knobs of the same type recur elsewhere on the mask on the inner point of the horns and again toward the middle; at the base of the pointed forehead; on the ears and the remaining tusk.  The nose forms the loop holding the ring handle.  A short lug projects from the base of the mask behind the loop that holds the ring.   Patina grey-green.",
