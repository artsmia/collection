  "description": "This beast probably served as one of the supports for a vessel. The hind legs of the contorted body lie flat. The front legs are turned up so that the back of the twisted body also lies flat, thus weight of the object supported. The body is decorated on one side only. There are large spirals on legs and haunches, and bands of stylized stripes extending from neck to tail. Stripes appear also above the eyes. The shoulders are emphasized by large spiral-bearing comma figures in rounded relief. Around the neck is a cowrie band. the head is cracked from the lower left corner of the nose to the lower corner of the right eye where the crevice widens, with a piece missing between the ear and the right jaw. The tail is missing. Patina greyed-green with bright green patches.",
