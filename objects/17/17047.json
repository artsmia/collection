  "description": "Court robe of gold satin brocade with nine 5-clawed dragons. In the field are scattered very loose clouds, cranes, long-life characters, Buddhist and Taoist symbols. Conventional border of wavy slanting stripes(achieved by ribbing the brocade); rather deep tight clouds, cf. Kang Hsi; deeply rolling waves in which appear some Taoist emblems and some of the Eight Precious Things. Wide deep sleeves with no border and no cuff bound with double band of plain gold satin. Half collar band of gold satin; neck and opening bound with double satin band like sleeve band. The only variation from the gold tone of this robe is the area of the dragon's eyes which is ivory in tone. This may have been a woman's robe. Lining of thin tan silk of lozenge pattern.",
