  "description": "Imperial 12-symbol robe of yellow k'ossu with nine five-clawed dragons in gold. In the field of spaced, sprawling clouds appear the 12 symbols, crimson bats carrying swastikas and the double peach and good luck characters. Border of slanting stripes topped with a tight regular band of clouds and two rows of billows in which appear Buddhist symbols, carp, and flowers. Band and cuffs of black k'ossu with motifs of the body. Sleeves of blistered medallion silk. Body slit at front, back and sides and lined with coarse yellow silk. The k'ossu is of inferior quality but the colors are good. The unusually short length of this robe indicates that it must have been made early in T'ung Chih's reign, while he was still a youth.",
