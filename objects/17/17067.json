  "description": "Portrait vase with stirrup handle.  The vase represents a seated man, knees drawn up to chin and gripped with the hands.  The modelling of the head, covered with a close-fitting cap, is bold an vigorous, with the melancholy expression conveyed with great skill.  The rudimentary modelling of the limbs emphasizes the powerful realism of the head.",
