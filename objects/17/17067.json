  "description": "Portrait vase with stirrup handle. The vase represents a seated man, knees drawn up to chin and gripped with the hands. The modelling of the head, covered with a close-fitting cap, is bold an vigorous, with the melancholy expression conveyed with great skill. The rudimentary modelling of the limbs emphasizes the powerful realism of the head.",
