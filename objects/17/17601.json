  "description": "The sculpture quality of these dishing beasts is admirably conveyed by their carriage, the proud pose of their heads, and the almost arrogant suppleness of their bodies. The forceful comma-shapes of the tails and their jaunty tufts, as well as the double-rope pattern on the mustachios, give ample proof that, in spite of the scale that, in these creatures must be dated later than Middle Zhou.
