  "description": "Imperial 12-symbol robe of pale yellow satin embroidered in satin stitch and couched gold threads.  Traditional universe design with nine 5-clawed dragons in gold, a field of loose, fragmentary clouds in which appear the 12 symbols, Buddhist symbols, crimson bats carrying branches of coral, jui scepters, and other auspicious emblems and good luck characters.  Deep 'hurricane wave' border in which stripes break through the waves, filled with Buddhist symbols, flowers and Precious Things.  Border and cuffs of reddish purple satin embroidered in satin stitch and couching with motifs of the body.  Yellow satin sleeves.  Robe slit at front and sides and lined with coarse yellow silk.  The violet and some red colors are aniline.  This robe presents an interesting variation of the Heavenly Sea border and harks back to the Yung Cheng period in its treatment.  Cf. 42.8.183 and 42.8.11",
