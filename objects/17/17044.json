  "description": "Imperial robe of pale coral-colored k'ossu with nine 5-clawed dragons in gold.  In field loose clouds, bats and the double happiness character.  This robe is almost identical to 42.8.72 except for length(this is much shorter with unusually narrow border--cut off?).  Sleeves have wide,deep cuffs of blue k'ossu with floral sprays, medallions and bats, separated from border of upper sleeve only by a band of blue and gold fret meander brocade.  Collar band of same pattern as cuffs.  Around armhole a narrow strip of gold braid.  Robe slit at sides, lined with crimson damask in cloud pattern and faced at bottom and to depth of side slits, with a band of the gold and blue brocade.  A woman's robe and possibly the wedding mate to 42.8.72 in view of double happiness characters and similarity of design.  Dragon's eyes embroidered.  Some painted detail appears.",
