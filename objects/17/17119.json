  "text": "Audrey Freeman trained at the Minneapolis School of Art (now Minneapolis College of Art and Design) and at the Art Students League in New York. This scene depicts a rural barn that offered theater and dance events for the community. Freeman’s later work as a restorer of miniatures and dolls seems foreshadowed here. Her careful attention to the lively figures wearing brilliantly colored clothing makes for a dazzling composition.",
