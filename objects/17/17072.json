At the bottom of the field the Heavenly Sea.  The front of the robe is adorned at the shoulders with large medallions carrying frontal dragons.  Beneathe each medallion is a pagoda resting on a heap of clouds.  In the field, tight clouds, bats, cranes and Buddhist symbols.  The borders are embroidered in couched silk twist with Buddhist symbols, dragons, carp, Precious Things, clouds and other symbols.  The border sections are of fine workmanship and are undoubtedly older that the major portion of the robe itself.",
