In the field are six octagons in red and ivory filled with a large geometric device. Surrounding these panels are s-forms, triangular bands, animals, lozenges, and other typical Caucasian designs. Three border stripes, the central one filled with an s-shaped arrangement of the latch hook on an ivory ground, the outer and inner one carrying the barber pole stripe in red, blue, rust and white. At one end a narrow selvage with knotted warp fringe, at the other a narrow warp fringe. Sides overcast with rose-colored wool. Natural wool warp, greyish-white wool woof. Ghiordes knot. The short-cut nap of fine silky wool is worn to the warp in spots.",
