Because the Chinese word for bat (<I>fu<I>) sounds the same as the word for happiness, the bat became extremely popular as an auspicious motif. Emblematic of joy and happiness, bats can be found in nearly all of the decorative arts of the late Ming and Ch'ing dynasties and they were extremely popular as motifs in women's clothing, jewelry and costume accessories.",
