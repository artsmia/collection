  "description": "This spirited beast, raised on its hind legs, throws its head up and back as it bates on some object held in the left paw. Its mane, sweeping down on the back in broad curls, is executed in incised lines. The two ends of the split tail are twisted once before the curling end are affixed to the hind legs. the claws are indicated by raised lines and the tufts on the legs by long, thin spirals in low relief. A pear-shaped opening in the belly indicates that the lion was applied as an accessory member to a vessel or some similar object. Patina green and greyed-green.",
