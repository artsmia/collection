  "description": "These beasts, contorted for the probable purpose of serving as vessel supports, are similar, with one exception, to the example without a tail (50.46.70). The decor consists of spirals on legs, haunches, and tail; bands of stripes in an S-shaped pattern extending from shoulders to tail; a band of cowries around the neck, and a large comma shape in high, rounded relief on the shoulders. On these examples, however, a small granulated band appears at the base of the nose.",
