  "text": "Born and raised in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Caporaso moved to Paris in 1961 to study intaglio printmaking at S.W. Hayter's Atelier 17. Her work is characteristically abstract, often exploring themes associated with water and natural elements, as in this color etching that suggests brilliant sunlight reflected from the surface of moving water. Around this time, Hayter, too, began to investigate abstract surface patterns and motion in his own work, experimenting with capturing the shifting and changing patterns of waves and intersecting linear structures. In 1968, Caporaso opened her own printmaking studio in Paris, where she continues to work today.",
