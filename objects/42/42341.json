  "text": "Dressed as Øharame, literally \"women from the Øhara district,\" who come to the sell their hometown products such as flowers and firewood in the city streets of Kyoto, the figures depicted here are actually men performing a Kyogen play. Kyogen is a form of Japanese traditional theater accompanied by music and singing. Because its contents are comical and light-hearted, Kyogen is often performed as part of New Year's celebrations. The play titled \"Wakana,\" meaning \"young greens\" is among the most popular for the season because it features a scene with colorfully dressed \"women\" carrying flowers, which is appropriately happy and funny. The elaborately patterned costumes of the dancers, partly printed with gold pigment, suggest the resourcefulness of the poetry group who commissioned this print. ",
