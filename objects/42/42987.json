  "text": "For this project, the second that Rauschenberg completed at the Gemini G.E.L. print workshop, the artist appropriated images from publicity stills and film clips from the 1967 Hollywood movie Bonnie and Clyde, which starred actors Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty in the lead roles. Rauschenberg had been commissioned to produce a Time magazine cover featuring the movie. His interest in the theme derived from personal memories of the site of the movie and his friendship with Beatty and Michael Pollard, who also appeared in the film. This print is one of six editioned lithographs Rauschenberg produced for the Reels (B + C) series.",
