  "text": "During New Year's holiday, itinerant puppeteers performed for delighted crowds of children. The earliest puppeteers were associated with Ebisu shrine in Hyøgo prefecture, causing this style of puppetry to be called Ebisu-mawashi (wanderers from Ebisu). Hiding their hands behind a large rectangular box suspended from their necks, Ebisu-mawashi puppeteers skillfully worked the dolls on the box-top stage. The show always ended with the appearance of a weasel, whose furry fake tail suddenly popped out of the box, playfully startling the children. The little boy dressed in a red kimono in this picture, however, is delighted by this trick and excitedly points at the puppet on the box while his mother looks on.",
