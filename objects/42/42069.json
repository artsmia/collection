  "text": "A Psalter is a book that includes the Book of Psalms extracted from the Latin Vulgate Bible, the translation made in the late 4th century by Saint Jerome. Scribes of one generation after another had meticulously copied the text for a thousand years before the production of this sheet. Look closely to see the carefully ruled lines that helped the scribe maintain the precision and uniformity of the text. The scribe left spaces so that the illuminator could insert the finely decorated initials that mark the beginnings of sentences and verses. The slightly larger initial marks the beginning of a new Psalm. If a sentence did not reach the end of the line, a bit of decoration would be inserted to fill the space.",
