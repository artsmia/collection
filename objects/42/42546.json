  "text": "Like many customs associated with the coming of New Year, playing battledore has its origins in a religious rite. Dating to as early as the eighth century, it was originally played within shrine precincts to wish young girls good health. By the Edo period (1615-1868), it became customary to play the game during the New Year holidays. Although similar to badminton, it is played with a rectangular wooden paddle instead of a racket. One of the players shown here, the man holding a paddle in his right hand, is featured as Ebisu, a mythical figure typically depicted with a large round hat and a broad smile.  As one of the Seven Gods of Fortune, Ebisu is associated with business success. Therefore, this print may have been commissioned by a group whose members were merchants.",
