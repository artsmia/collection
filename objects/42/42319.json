  "text": "White-eyes are small birds native to tropical, subtropical and temperate southern and eastern Asia-including Japan. Here, the artists depicted a white-eye grasping onto a branch in an almost upside-down position, as if it just alighted to feast on the ripe red fruit. The leaves on the branch are turning orange and brown, suggesting the coming of autumn. What makes this rather simple composition charming is its delicate coloring. The light green of the bird beautifully contacts with the autumnal colors of the branch. The pale pink gradation applied on the bird's underside accents its slight plumpness, evidence of its preparations for winter.",
