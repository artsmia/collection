  "text": "According to the inscription in the upper right portion of this print, it was made to commemorate the retirement of a man whose son will assume his duties and good name. The man, presumably depicted here in the formal wide-sleeved attire and a black lacquered hat, is celebrating this occasion with his two friends who are similar in age.  As suggested by the presence of a sake bottle and cup, they have been drinking and now they are happily inebriated. The man on the left, who has allowed his robe to slip off his shoulder, pretends to play music on his fishing pole-much to the amusement of his companions. In fact, the poems indicate that the men are performers. Prints that announced a performer's retirement were often produced and distributed to fans as a way thanking them for their support.",
