  "text": "The artist Shibata Zeshin adroitly captures nature's vitality by depicting a close-up view of a robust sunflower. His characteristically bold brush strokes contribute to the liveliness of this flower, long an emblem of summer.  A finely rendered grasshopper appears to have just hopped onto a flower petal. Although Zeshin did not include the sun itself, one can almost feel the blistering heat of the season.",
