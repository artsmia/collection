  "text": "Beneath the traditional white headdress and elaborate gown is a highly unusual bride. This scene may illustrate one of many Japanese folktales involving marriages between humans and animals, or it may simply represent the mischievous nature of monkeys. In any case, the monkey's furry face peeking out from the headdress, and its hairy foot protruding from beneath the hem of the dress, make for a comical image.",
