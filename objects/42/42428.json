  "text": "As the young brother of Matsumura Goshun (1752-1811), the founder of Shijø School, Keibun greatly contributed to the development of the school. While his brother exceled in landscapes, Keibun's forte was birds and flowers in a delicate naturalistic style. Keibun designed this print of a kingfisher for members of a poetry society, whose verses are included with the image. Since all the poems are about winter, the design appropriately shows dried and withered leaves-a beautiful contrast to the bird's colorful plumage.",
