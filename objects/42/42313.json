  "text": "Originally imported from China, tiger lilies grow wild throughout Japan. Their large orange flowers bloom in profusion in early summer. The artist Shumpo here depicts a fully bloomed flower and a tightly closed bud on a long stem with lush green leaves. His design thus shows the lily as if in its natural environment, and effectively evokes the viewer's memories of summer in Japan's fields and mountains.",
