  "text": "After World War I, George Bellows turned from graphic denunciations of war to more sentimental themes; half of the lithographs from 1921 portray family and friends. This was also the year he bought land to build a new summer home in Woodstock, New York. The playful Legs of the Sea is set in Newport, Rhode Island, near where the Bellows family vacationed.",
