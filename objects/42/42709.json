  "text": "One of the most influential artists of the German post-war avant-garde, Joseph Beuys sought to greatly expand the conventional definition of art by stressing its universal role in life and its power to initiate social, cultural, and political transformations. \r\n\r\nOriginally conceived as part of an elaborate underwater book, this untitled multiple is one of 44 double-sided leaves Beuys planned for the project. The images were taken from photographs and film stills of the artist and his public performances and then screenprinted on each side of the PVC sheet. On some of the leaves, such as the present example, Beuys added hand-painted motifs and symbols, describing the color of acrylic paint he used as \"Braunkreuz\" (brown cross). The total weight of the edition of 100 books was intended to be 6,612 pounds, the equivalent of three tonnes (metric tons).",
