  "text": "Mosquitoes are a universal-and annoying-part of summer the world over. However, this depiction of two mosquitoes in flight, with their long, slender legs and delicately colored wings, is a charming interpretation of these reviled insects. Signed San'aisanjin, meaning \"a hermit who loves music, drinking, and poetry,\" the print may have been designed by one of the poets who contributed one of the poems inscribed here.",
