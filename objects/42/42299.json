  "text": "Mosquitoes are a universal-and annoying-part of summer the world over. However, this depiction of two mosquitoes in flight, with their long, slender legs and delicately colored wings, is a charming interpretation of these reviled insects. Signed San'aisanjin, meaning a hermit who loves music, drinking, and poetry, the print may have been designed by one of the poets who contributed one of the poems inscribed here.",
