  "text": "The Japanese have long considered monkeys to be auspicious creatures. Warriors often had monkeys paraded through their stables, believing that they were effective in protecting their horses from sickness. During the Edo period (1615-1868) trained monkeys were taken door-to-door at New Years, performing tricks and bestowing ceremonious blessings in exchange for a small monetary reward. In this print, a monkey rides on the back of his trainer as the pair make their way to the next house. Japan's sacred Mount Fuji rises in the background and a kite flies overhead, both auspicious symbols.",
