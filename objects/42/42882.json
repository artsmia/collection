  "text": "Inspired by Spanish printmaker Francisco Goya (1746-1828), Doel Reed mastered aquatint-a challenging intaglio process that produces areas of tone that look like ink and wash drawings. Born in Indiana, Reed spent much of his career in the Southwest. Soon after completing Spring he started spending summers near Taos, New Mexico, where he eventually retired. His aquatints feature landscapes alone and with women, often solid, classical figures in reclining poses.",
