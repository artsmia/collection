  "text": "No corner of New York escaped Reginald Marsh's art, from shopgirls to breadlines, derelicts to derricks. But his favorite subject was the pleasure-seekers at Coney Island, where, he said, \"a million near-naked bodies could be seen at once, a phenomenon unparalleled in history.\" Indeed, Marsh overstuffs his scene with exuberant humanity. It also shows his preoccupation with anatomy: As part of his art training, the Yale-educated Marsh dissected corpses at New York medical schools.",
