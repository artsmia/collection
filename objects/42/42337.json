  "text": "According to the East Asian zodiac system, twelve years comprise one cycle and each of the twelve-years is symbolized by a specific animal. People display images of the animal associated with the New Year as a way of signifying their excitement for the arrival of the new season. Prints featuring the poems of literary societies naturally often featured an image of the year's symbolic animal. Published in 1867, the Year of the Hare, this design shows a man lovingly looking at a small woodcarving that depicts a rabbit. 2011 is also the Year of the Hare.",
