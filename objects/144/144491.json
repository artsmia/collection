  "text": "The reign of the Kangxi emperor (1661-1722) during the Qing dynasty saw great achievements in Chinese art, including carpet weaving. Those produced in Ningxia were especially favored by the emperor due to their high quality and level of artistry. They are often characterized by soft, elegant motifs, balanced patterns, and mellow color palettes – blue and white were frequently featured, as seen here.",
