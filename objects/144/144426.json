  "text": "Dawn Williams Boyd's The Middle Passage is part of a series, The Sins of the Father, featuring the artist's self described cloth paintings of quilted fabric, along with acrylic paintings on canvas or plywood. Begun some 25 years ago, the wide-ranging series addresses the complex history of racial violence against Black Americans, beginning with the horrors of the transatlantic slave trade and continuing to the present day murders of innocent Black men, women, and children. Here, Boyd presents a glimpse into the brutal inhumanity of the United States’ collective past. Two naked, enslaved men lie captive in the cargo hold of a ship, shackled and chained at their ankles. One of the men, seemingly defeated, stares without seeing, while the other shields his face and gazes at the specter of death lying aside him in the form of a human skeleton—an ominous harbinger of his fate.",
