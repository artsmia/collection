  "text": "Throughout his career, Truman Lowe would gather ash saplings and willow reeds from his homelands to create calm contemplative sculptures about water. Growing up along the banks of the Black River in west-central Wisconsin and raised in a vibrant artistic Ho-Chunk family of splint-ash basket makers, Lowe was immersed in a woodlands community living within and in relation to the land. Water, a universal and elemental source of all life, became an endless stream of metaphor and creativity for Lowe. In Woodland Forms, two canoe forms pared down to their essence, are nestled beside each other, vessels signifying an enduring flow of love and connection between two people.",
