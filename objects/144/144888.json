  "text": "Ralph Bacerra was a native Californian of Mexican heritage and studied with Vivika Heino at Chouinard Art Institute, in Los Angeles, earning a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in 1961. He also taught there from 1963 to 1972, when the Institute closed. After leaving Chouinard, Bacerra worked for a decade as a studio artist until accepting a position as chairman of the ceramics department at Otis College of Art and Design, in 1983, where he stayed for over a decade.\r\n\r\nBacerra produced a series of sculptural teapots inspired by nature, even forming them by draping wet clay over tree trunks and rocks. Here, his characteristic perfection of finish in the gold lustre glaze of the teapot contrasts with the imperfect surface of the matte red rustic base.",
