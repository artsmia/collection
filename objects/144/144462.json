  "text": "William Bradford took many trips to the Arctic in the 1860s and 1870s and made numerous paintings based on his experience of the climate, natural wonders, the changing light conditions and meetings with Indigenous people. In this scene he shows the precarious nature of these excursions. Ice has quickly overtaken the ship as the crew tries to navigate the sea. Forced to flee the boat, they make camp and wait out a thaw so that the might find a route to open water.",
