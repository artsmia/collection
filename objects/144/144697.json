  "text": "As part of her expansive series Domestic, Catherine Opie traveled across the United States to photograph lesbian  couples and their families in their homes. In Gina & April, two women affectionately embrace one another in bed.  Opie emphasizes the emotional depth and tenderness of the moment through her composition and the subtle use of light and shadow. Through works such as Gina & April, Opie invites us to consider the importance of representation and its impact on how we shape our understanding of identities and relationships.",
