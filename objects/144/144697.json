  "text": "Photographic image of two casually posed Black women lying together in a double bed, with the lower half of their bodies covered by a shared white comforter. One woman embraces the other from behind. The embraced woman lies on her side with closed eyes, while the embracing woman also lies on her side but is slightly raised on one elbow with eyes partly open. Both women have closely-cropped black hair; one wears a black tank top, the other a white tank top. The bed's mattress is covered with a floral-patterned mostly white fitted sheet. There are no pillows on the bed. The bed has a light brown slatted wood headboard. The bed is set against one wall of an otherwise empty white-walled bedroom with a slanted, attic-like ceiling.",
