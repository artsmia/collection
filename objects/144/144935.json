  "text": "Ken Ferguson studied at the American Academy of Art, in Chicago; the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University), in Pittsburgh; and Alfred University in Alfred, New York. From 1964 to 1996, he headed the ceramics department of the Kansas City Art Institute; several of the artists featured in this gallery were his students: Richard Notkin, Akio Takamori, and Kurt Weiser.  \r\n\r\nIn the 1980s, he turned from functional to outsized sculptural work, including a series of pots, baskets, and teapots decorated with applied hares. These hares have various connotations, including the Wyoming jackrabbits that Ferguson watched over the years, or the mythical wiliness of rabbits. The hares on Ferguson’s pots convey a sense of movement and power as they leap over their handles.",
