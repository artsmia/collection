  "style": "20th century",
  "text": "\"Panoply\" is a word that means a complete and impressive collection of things. That is an apt title for Roscoe Mitchell's painting, a densely packed universe of color, patterm, shape, and form. The range of textures and images in the picture push to the edge, where the artist's painted frame tames their frenzy with a solid green border. Mitchell is one of the most influential free-jazz musicians and composers of the last fifty years. It is tempting to imagine music pouring forth from the picture.",
