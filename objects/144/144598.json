  "text": "Pears, apples, potatoes, eggs, and bananas assemble symmetrically as if by magic in Martha Erlebacher's still-life painting. The artist has carefully observed and recreated every item, including the gathered cloth that cradles this bounty, in watercolor and pencil. Erlebacher was devoted to making and teaching realist art techniques, but the systematic mirrored arrangement hints at her foundation in abstraction and geometric design.",
