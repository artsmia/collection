  "text": "The vertical composition has as its center a large red rectangle that is flanked at each side by a thin yellow stripe and a larger blue one, while sitting on a yellow horizontal band. Applied on the red rectangle are four yellow geometric forms: at the top, a triangular one, that stands as an attribute of Ossaim, the Yorubá deity of healing, the one that has the knowledge of the uses of all herbs for medicinal purposes; the other three are variations of the half-moon (or the mirror) associated to Yemanjá, the Yorubá goddess of the rivers and seas, and mother of all Orishas (deities). The symmetry and the ascending aspect of the composition reinforces to the viewer the idea of looking at an altarpiece.",
