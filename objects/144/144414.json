  "text": "The hard and soft of nature collide in Hayashi’s work. Its solidity recalls stone and rock, while the repetitive curvilinear incisions and the swipes of color bring to mind wind and waves. Living and working near Kegon Falls, one of the three greatest waterfalls in Japan, Hayashi frequently draws inspiration from the power of nature. This work is part of a series called “Shunkan no naka no eien, ” which translates to the eternal within a moment. Through firing, Hayashi immortalizes the movement of the glaze in the surface of her work.\r\n\r\nHayashi taught ceramics at the Bunsei University of Art for over twenty years. In her own work and teaching, she has emphasized the importance of exploring the possibilities of ceramics by experimenting with new techniques, glazes, and firing temperatures.",
