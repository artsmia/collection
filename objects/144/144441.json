  "text": "At the center, Apollo plays his lyre as he presides over Mount Parnassus, the gathering place of the nine muses, who surround him. Poets from different eras have come in search of inspiration. For instance, at the left a scribe sits ready to record the words of the aged Greek Homer, the youthful Roman Virgil, and the mature Tuscan Dante.\r\n     Marcantonio Raimondi produced engravings that translated Raphael's ideas into printed form. This one is based on a preparatory design made by Raphael as he  developed his ideas for a fresco that he painted in the Vatican's Stanza delle Segnatura, then the office and library of Pope Julius II. An homage to a classical past, the engraving has the feel of an ancient relief sculpture.",
