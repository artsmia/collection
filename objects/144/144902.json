  "text": "After visiting Japan in 1974, Callas was inspired to build his own anagama, or tunnel kiln, to bring traditional wood-firing methods to the United States. Callas began creating works that referenced the simplicity of the Japanese tea ceremony, including tea bowls like this one. Its rough shape and uneven glazing give the piece a natural feel, as though it were just pulled from the earth, a look that is a direct result of the wood-firing process. Though a generation apart, Callas and Voulkos were friends; Callas fired Voulkos’s large stack pots in his anagama in the 1990s.\r\n",
