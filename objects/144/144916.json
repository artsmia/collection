  "text": "Stephen DeStaebler received his master’s degree from the University of California, Berkeley, in the 1960s, under the guidance of Peter Voulkos. DeStaebler’s early horizontal ceramic landscapes evolved into figures that emerge from vertical, architectural columns. He creates his figures from solid slabs of clay, which he uses his entire body to manipulate. In this way, he respects—not overcomes—the intrinsic properties of clay while associating the material’s earthiness with the human body. Altar to a Leg appears as a mysterious remnant of a possible ancient past, only now rediscovered.",
