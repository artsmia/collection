  "text": "James Barnor’s 1952 photograph offers a triple portrait; depicting the artist, a store attendant, and a small sliver of life in Accra in the years leading up to Ghana’s independence from Britain in 1957. Trained as both a portrait photographer and photojournalist, Barnor blends both traditions here. By pointing his camera at a mirror, Barnor places himself and his work in the bustle of the store, while the smiling young woman leaning against the counter.",
