  "text": "David Leach, the eldest son of Bernard Leach, apprenticed with his father at St. Ives in 1930 and trained as a pottery manager at North Staffordshire Technical College from 1935 to 1937. By 1945, he was a partner in the Leach pottery, though he opened his own pottery in Devon, England, in 1956. \r\n\r\nHe followed the mingei tenets of well-crafted pots for everyday use, and his style did not stray too far from his father’s. This bottle’s sloped shoulder, attenuated neck, and swiping calligraphic design in iron slip show a further refinement to Bernard’s pots. Through the last half of the 20th century, he created production tablewares at the pottery, facing the challenges of consistently producing quality wares at a high production level into the 1990s.",
