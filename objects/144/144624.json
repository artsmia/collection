  "text": "Powerful, energy-filled whorls emerge from within the deep blue hues of the paper. In this work, artist Kiki Smith conveys something similar to a satellite view of meteorological phenomena such as a hurricane or even the flight patterns of birds. The lines seem to swirl and move across the work. As we follow them in their circular motion, Smith draws us into the chaos and beauty of the natural world.",
