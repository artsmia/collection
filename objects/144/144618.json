Zhang Xiang, called Yuhu, \r\nat the age of sixty-five.” \r\n\r\n",

  "text": "This painting illustrates a scene from <i>Peach-Blossom Spring</i>, a tale written by poet Tao Qian (365–428). It tells of a fisherman who encounters a small opening in a mountain from which flows a bubbling spring. Through the opening is a utopia where people live in harmony and happiness, a metaphor for a refuge from our tumultuous world.\r\n\r\nZhang Xiang’s painting captures the fisherman mooring his boat, dwarfed by the vast, misty landscape before him. The stream winds through the mountains, and hidden dwellings appear beyond. Ominous bluffs of rock frame the scene, conveying the untouchable nature of this idyllic realm.\r\n",
