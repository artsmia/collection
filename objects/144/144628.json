  "text": "This painting depicts a scene from the “Jungle Chapter” of the epic. Ram, Lakshmana, and Sita (an incarnation of the goddess Laxmi) have been forced into exile by Ram’s stepmother and are seen here approaching the dwelling of the bearded sage Agastya on the sprouted banks of the Godavari River. Lakshmana and Sita clasp their hands in a gesture of devotion, while Ram bows before the sage to touch his feet—a sign of ultimate respect. Agastya, in turn, advises them on vanquishing Ravana’s evil powers and blesses them with courage to succeed in their endeavor.",
