  "text": "The subject of this scene comes from Book 3, the Aranyakanda or Jungle Chapter of the great Hindu Epic, the Ramayana. It depicts a section of the story which narrates the exile of Prince Ram--the eighth incarnation of the lord Vishnu, sent to earth to vanquish the demon Ravana—along with his wife Sita (incarnation of the goddess Laxshmi) and loyal brother, Lakshmana, in the forest. Here, the group is seen approaching the dwelling of the bearded sage Agastya, set in a tranquil bower of staves with an illusionary door. Set on the sprouted banks of the Godavari River, Lakshmana and Sita clasp their hands in a gesture of devotion, while Ram bows before the sage to touch his feet—a sign of ultimate respect towards one’s elders. Agastya, in turn, offers them critical insights on Ravana’s evil powers and blesses them with courage to succeed their endeavor.",
