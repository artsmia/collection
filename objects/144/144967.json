  "text": "Wayne Higby joined the faculty of the New York College of Ceramics, at Alfred University, in 1973, and broke with the tradition of the vessel that was so strong there. He had already begun to make ceramic sculptures, evolved from functional forms such as containers and tiles, inspired by the landscapes of his native Colorado. He heavily uses the raku technique, which involves heating ceramics until red hot and then quickly cooling them, generally in combustible material like sawdust or newspaper. This often results in a crazed surface. Window Wall Canyon, through its extensions further into three-dimensional space, transforms a tile into a meditative vista with a river running through it.",
