  "text": "Cardew was Bernard Leach’s first pupil at St. Ives, studying there from 1924 to 1926. He subsequently established English workshops in Winchcombe, Gloucestershire (where he focused on reviving 18th-century English slipware), and at Wenford Bridge, Cornwall. After teaching pottery in Ghana during World War II, he returned to Britain in 1948. \r\n\r\nThis bowl, with its loosely depicted bird, is typical of Cardew’s later stoneware production at Wenford Bridge. Fish were a favorite motif shared with Leach, as seen on the bowl nearby.",
