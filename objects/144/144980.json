  "text": "Karen Karnes studied ceramics at Brooklyn College and the New York College of Ceramics at Alfred University. In 1952, she became a resident potter at Black Mountain College in Asheville, North Carolina, where she—like Peter Voulkos at the Archie Bray Center in Montana— workshopped with Bernard Leach and Shoji Hamada on their 1952 tour. Upon her return to New York that year, she established a studio at Stony Point. \r\n\r\nShe began working with abstract organic forms after moving to Vermont in 1979. Dolphin derived from her “winged vessels, ” which merged functional and sculptural forms, evolving from covered tureen-like dishes to shimmering zoomorphic porpoises.",
