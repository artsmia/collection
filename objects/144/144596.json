  "text": "In Waterfall, large thin supple strands of ash pour down from a fixed state, creating a sense of movement and tranquility. Throughout his career, Truman Lowe would gather ash saplings and willow reeds from his homelands to create calm contemplative sculptures about water. Growing up along the banks of Black River Wisconsin and raised in a vibrant artistic Ho-Chunk family of splint-ash basket makers, Lowe was immersed in a Woodlands community living within and in relation to the land. Water, a universal and elemental source of all life, became an endless stream of metaphor and creativity for Lowe.",
