  "text": "Thin black lines define the corners and edges of this drawing. They radiate towards the center to form polygon shapes and a geometric matrix. Beneath them, glowing tones in watercolor soak the paper. Thin white spumes like fluid or plant forms grow on top of the composition. The artist, Paulina Peavy felt a soul bond with a Spirit named Lacamo, and she went into trance states to commune with Lacamo and jointly make this art. For Peavy this was a way of blurring gender boundaries and connecting on a higher plane of consciousness and existence.",
