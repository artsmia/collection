The cover bears a faded inscription in French: Paisages de / Vande Velde. The edges of the pages are dyed light red. There are 59 prints in the volume, arranged into five sets, each with its own title page. The images are mostly pastoral and agricultural with many dilapidated buildings. Each of the landscapes is peopled with tiny figures.",
