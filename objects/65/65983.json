  "text": "Charles Adams Platt was not only an accomplished etcher, but also a talented painter, architect, and writer. He studied art at the National Academy of Design and at the Art Students League of New York, as well as at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, and was highly regarded during the late nineteenth century. During his successful career, Platt received many awards, including the bronze medal from the 1900 Universal Exposition in Paris. Platt learned etching in 1880, and for the next ten years he devoted himself almost exclusively to the medium.",
