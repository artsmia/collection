  "text": "Budai, or Hotei in Japanese, is a folkloric deity of Chinese origins. In Buddhism, he is understood to be an incarnation of the Buddha of the Future, Maitreya. He is usually depicted as a bald, chubby monk carrying a staff and large sack that holds all his possessions. In this image he sits before his large sack, and his staff lies before him with three chintamani, or wish-fulfilling jewels, a common implement of Buddhist deities. The painter of this image, Shunsō Shōjū, was a well-known Zen priest who rose to the rank of abbot of Myōshinji, one of the largest Zen monasteries in Kyoto.",
