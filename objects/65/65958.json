  "text": "Hotei (in Chinese, Budai) sits, legs crossed, with his large sack of possessions; his staff and three wish-fulfilling jewels (in Sanskrit, Cintāmaṇi) are placed in front of him. His friendly demeanor, portly figure, and later association with good fortune made him a popular subject in paintings in Japan. Shunsō  Shō ju was the 470th abbot at the Rinzai Zen Buddhist temple of Myō shin-ji in Kyoto. He grew up in a fishing village and took the tonsure (the shaven crown worn by monks) at the young age of 10. Shunsō  studied under one of the disciples of Hakuin, whose work is also shown in this gallery.",
