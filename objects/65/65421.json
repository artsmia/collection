  "text": "The Terrace of the Villa Brancas could be a love letter to Félix Bracquemond’s wife, Marie, then thirty-six. By portraying her outdoors at her easel, analyzing the light falling on her sister, Louise, Félix honored Marie’s profession as a painter and her identification with Impressionist concerns like the effects of light. He also demonstrated that black and white can be as effective as color in capturing filtered light on a sunny day.\r\n\r\nThe couple moved to Villa Brancas, their home in Sèvres, near Paris, in 1871, two years after they married. Félix found work decorating ceramics at the Sèvres porcelain factory, which is visible behind the umbrella.",
