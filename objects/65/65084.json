  "text": "The four islands identified in the title cartouche of this print are located off the shore of Kanazawa Beach, today part of Yokohama City. As seen here, it was a quiet fishing village in Hiroshige's time. While the women on the beach were busily gathering seashells, the full moon rises in the sky. The afterglow of the sunset that remains above the horizon, however, suggests the evening is still young. Two fishing boats are shown making their way back to port before the last light of day disappears.",
