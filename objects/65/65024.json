  "inscription": "An old story about how the pond was named Otamgaike. Originally this pond was called Sakuragaike (cherry pond) because of the big cherry tree by the pond. There was a woman serving tea under the cherry tree to the travellers passing by the pond. Her name was Tama and she was a very beautiful woman. Many male customers fell in love with her. Two of them were especially into her. But something happened. (Sorry I can't read that part)\r\nShe finally committed suicide by jumping into the pond. Since then, people have been calling the pond Otamagaike (Tama's pond) in memory of her.",
