  "text": "This study of a family is an early work in the career of Daniel Chodowiecki. Like many artists throughout Europe in the 1700s, he picked up on the practice of Dutch artists from the prior century—most notably Rembrandt—who made small sketch-like etchings of people they saw in the streets. Chodowiecki’s mature work took a different turn as he lavished care on his etchings, filling them with elaborate detail and atmospheric lighting.",
