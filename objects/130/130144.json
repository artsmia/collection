  "text": "What would it feel like to enter into a scene from your favorite film? Photographer Alec Soth made a pilgrimage to the hotel featured in the film “Lost in Translation” in order to answer that question. This photograph of the Tokyo skyline is the same as the one seen from the window of one of the main characters. The multicolored lights of the city shimmer beyond the edge of a curtain drawn back by Soth’s hand, alluding to the sleeplessness of the jetlagged and lovelorn characters within the film.",
