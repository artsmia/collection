This photograph of the Tokyo skyline is the same as the one seen from the window of one of the main characters. The multicolored lights of the city shimmer beyond the edge of a curtain drawn back by Soth’s hand, alluding to the sleeplessness of the jetlagged and lovelorn characters within the film.",
