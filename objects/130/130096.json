  "text": "C. Maxx Stevens explores cultural and personal memories to create works of art that bridge her past and present. Because of a childhood illness, memory has been illusive for Stevens, but she receives clues, such as a dress she wore in grade school, from her family members. She then gives form to her recollections creating works that evolve between truth and fantasy. In the installation work 'Childhood', the “unfinished” nature of her materials is intentional and suggests the fragility and imperfection of memory. For Stevens, the crow is both a messenger and protector, ever present in her life and work.",
