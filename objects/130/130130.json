Born in Minnesota, Bradley moved to the American Southwest and trained at the Institute of American Indian Arts (IAIA), and went on to earn a Bachelor of Arts in Fine Arts from the College of Santa Fe in 1980. Bradley is known mostly for his crisp graphic paintings and prints featuring socio-political content. In this early lithograph entitled  Awakening from a Dream, Bradley depicts a man lying on a couch, presumably in the Southwest, once asleep and then awakening to the cultural and environmental landscape of the area.",
