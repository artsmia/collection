Bradley is most known mostly for his crisp graphic paintingswith socio-political content. In this early lithograph entitled  Awakening from a Dream, Bradley depicts a man lying on a couch, presumably in the Southwest, once asleep and then awakening to the cultural and environmental landscape of the area.",
