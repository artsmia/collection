  "text": "Seeing a great work of art for the first time can be overwhelming. Photographer Robert Polidori captures the viewer’s experience of encountering Michelangelo’s iconic sculpture of a Biblical hero, David, in this large-scale photograph of the Accademia in Florence, Italy. The colossal sculpture appears to return the gaze of the viewer, his hand poised in a gesture that could be read as a sign to draw nearer—or to stay back.",
