  "text": "Part art, part science, David Goldes’ recent series of abstract geometric drawings relies on the conductive properties of graphite as a critical feature of their creation. In this example, Goldes forms the primary composition by applying numerous layers of graphite on paper prepared with a black gesso (diluted plaster) ground. Leaving small gaps between the thick graphite elements, he then applies a 15, 000-volt electric current to one side of the drawing. As the electricity reaches a gap, the current arcs and scorches or even burns the paper, leaving distinctive marks that add an intriguing element of chance to the drawing process.",
