  "text": "On the Road with the Nomadic Festival is a travelogue zine about a group of young adults train hopping and squatting their way around America while partying and organizing workshops about autonomous communities (self-governed intentional communities gathered for a shared, often political purpose). The zine is colored with anarchist idealism, anti-capitalist critique, and a desire for dramatic political and social change, exemplifying a genre of travel literature popular among anarchist, punk, and squatting subcultures. Sometimes called anarcho-nomadism, the idea of temporary, travelling punk communities was also a divisive topic, inspiring a range of zines both critical of and in support of the movement.",
