  "text": "Lambert Hitchcock has emerged as one of the most famous entrepreneurs in America through his chair manufactory, which he established in 1818 near Hartford, Connecticut.  By the 1830s, Hitchcock annually sent upwards of 15,000 chairs to furniture retailers throughout New England and the South.  He advertised his firm by stenciling his name on the back seat rail of chairs produced at his factory.  \r\n\r\nThe majority of Hitchcock's chairs are turned, from the crest rail to the front seat rail.  Their \"fancy\" patterns include stenciled floral bouquets over a surface painted to imitate rosewood.  These chairs retain their original paint and probably their original finishes and seats, making them rare survivals among early-nineteenth century mass-produced furniture.",
