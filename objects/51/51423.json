  "text": "Glass made at John Frederick Amelung's manufactory ranged from the more common tumblers and goblets to elaborate sugar bowls and candlesticks, of which this example is the only candlestick with handles known to exist. The whimsical bird-like terminals of the stem were formed through the skillful shaping of glass. Amelung was the first American glass manufacturer of refined tablewares and his designs were unparalleled in the United States.  He became a shrewd businessman by offering his glass to American dignitaries, such as President George Washington, in the hope of gaining financial and political support for his business.",
