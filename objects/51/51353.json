  "text": "Electric drink mixers provide an enduring link with 1930's America. Their base and stem are invariably vitreous-enamelled in the ubiquitous Depression green, and they evoke fond memories of the diners and drugstores where they became a mandatory fixture. Their simplified elegance and function (a switch-actuated paddle started as soon as the drink flask was inserted in place), assured fast service and eliminated the need for external controls.",
