  "text": "Ottavio Leoni depicted the painter Tommaso Salini (1575–1625) a number of times--this etching dating to the year of Salini's death. The two artists must have been close friends, despite Salini testifying in court in the famous libel suit brought by Giovanni Baglione against Caravaggio that Leoni was the author of the insulting sonnets circulating around Rome about Baglione.\r\n\r\nThe two head studies of the young woman represent the artist's stepdaughter, Maddalena Telli, who appears in related portrait drawings by the artist (now Rhode Island School of Design and Fondation Custodia, Paris), and served as Leoni's model in his paintings \"Susanna and the Elders\" (Detroit Institute of Arts) and \"Christ and the Adulterer\" Banca Popolare dell’ Emilia Romagna. We are grateful to Yuri Primarosa for identifying this figure.",
