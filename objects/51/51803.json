  "text": "In the Admiralty Islands, prestige bowls were carried as part of wedding processions through the village with other dowry gifts, and used to hold coconut oil at the bridal feast. The bowl was expertly sculpted from one large block of wood on Lou, one of the smaller islands in the Admiralty group, and traded from there. The handles, made separately and attached with nut paste, are purely ornamental. The bowl may represent a spirit ship - the handles are similar in style to the decorative prow and stern of ceremonial canoes.",
