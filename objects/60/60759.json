But when adorned with false braids, beads, pins, or combs, they can indicate much more: ethnic origin, gender, profession, status, even what phase of life you’re in. These two combs and a hairpin—from West, Central, and East Africa, respectively —show how African artists turn even mundane objects into accomplished carvings.",
