  "text": "Tea masters use small scoops, known as chashaku, to measure and draw powdered green tea from delicate tea caddies. Tea enthusiasts prize these humble objects because they are often crafted by tea masters themselves, rather than by professional artisans. While scoops of precious metals, iron, and ivory are sometimes used, bamboo is preferred because of the natural beauty of its surface variations and because there is little chance that a scoop fashioned from bamboo will damage the delicate mouths of ceramic and lacquer tea caddies.",
