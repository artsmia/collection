Another important outlet was America House Gallery on East 52nd Street in New York, run by Aileen Webb, the founder of the American Craft Council. America House featured the work of craft artists throughout the country.  A local collector ordered this tea service from America House, along with the nearby charger and other items, in 1951 and 1952.",
