  "text": "Hairstyles have long reflected personal aesthetics in African and African-American cultures. And when adorned with extensions, beads, pins, or combs, they can indicate a person’s status, ethnic origin, gender, profession, or even what phase of life they’re in. These three combs, from West and Central Africa, show how African artists turn even everyday objects into accomplished carvings.",
