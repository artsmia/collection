  "text": "This <i>junzhong</i> (均鐘), a five-stringed instrument constructed from a single piece of wood, is remarkable for its state of preservation and vivid colors. Popular since the time of Confucius (6th century BCE) and still played today in various forms, the <i>junzhong</i>, and its more common relative known as the <i>qin</i> (see an example in Gallery 216), is arguably the oldest continuous musical tradition in the world. Its unique notational system, which records detailed finger techniques that indicate tonal subtleties, has persisted since at least the Tang dynasty (618–907 CE).",
