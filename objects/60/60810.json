  "text": "Hiroshige is justifiably renowned for his ability to effectively convey different times of day, atmospheric conditions, and weather. The small government checkpoint at Sho_no, lacking any distinguishing physical landmark, allowed him to concentrate on rendering a rainstorm. Fine diagonal lines arranged in irregular bands effectively convey the sheets of rain that pelt the travelers along the roadway. The distant bamboo grove, too, convincingly portrays the gusting wind. Through the postures of the travelers, Hiroshige further suggests the ferocity of the storm. The palanquin bearers carefully maintain a steady gait on the wet road, while the figures descending the hill break into a run as the maelstrom intensifies.",
