  "text": "Tall reeds bend gracefully over a bank of grass while a host of crabs scuttle along the water’s edge, pincers held high. The crab was a standard subject of paintings, and like bamboo and orchids lent itself to expressive brushwork. Originally mounted as four hanging scrolls, this composition has a panoramic effect—difficult to achieve in the single, hanging-scroll format.\r\nThe shorter of the two inscriptions reads:\r\n\r\nOne hundred crabs,\r\nSet free in river or lake\r\nThey come and go as they please.\r\nReeds continue through the end of spring\r\nAnd the fragrant mayweed through autumn;\r\nThroughout their lives they are unwilling\r\nTo lower their paired eyes,\r\nHoping to see to the end of the pure\r\nAnd sometimes muddy stream.\r\n\r\nPainted and inscribed by Zhao Guangqi during an autumn month in 1835",
