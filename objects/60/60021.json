  "text": "Tall reeds bend gracefully over a bank of grass enclosing a host of crabs scuttling along the water's edge with pincers held high. The artists are father and son. Zhao Ziyong was from Nanhai, modern Canton. He earned his second-level degree in 1816 and was appointed a district magistrate in Shandong. A number of the so-called Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou had served in Shandong during the preceding century, and this connection seems to have influenced Zhao Guangqi to follow their expressionistic approach to painting. A standard theme in paintings, the crab, like bamboo and orchid, lent itself to expressive brushwork. Originally mounted as four hanging scrolls, the composition takes on a panoramic effect, difficult to achieve in the single, hanging-scroll format. The shorter of the two inscriptions reads: One hundred crabs, Set free in river or lake They come and go as they please. Reeds continue through the end of spring And the fragrant may-weed through autumn; Throughout their lives they are unwilling To lower their paired eyes, Hoping to see to the end of the pure And sometimes muddy stream. Painted and inscribed by Zhao Guangqi during an autumn month in 1835.",
