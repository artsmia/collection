  "text": "This buckle is decorated in relief with a winged dragon, a motif that was emblematic of the court during the Han dynasty. It is set with cabochons of turquoise and agate. Turquoise had been used throughout the Bronze Age for decorative inlay in metal. While perhaps not in classic Han court taste, this luxurious buckle is exactly the type of object that would have impressed rulers of remote provinces. \r\n\r\nThe dragon here is still Chinese, but the decoration and design reflect Eurasian influences, from the inlaid precious stones in oval shapes to the dots puncturing the metal to the shape of the buckle itself, which is derived from the Eurasian grasslands nomadic culture.",
