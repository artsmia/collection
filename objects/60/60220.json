  "text": "Zen masters have long drawn circles (ensō) in the air, scratched them in the sand, and painted them on silk and paper as symbols of perfection and the enlightened mind. Taidō was a Rinzai Zen priest and abbot of Daitokuji, an important monastery located in Kyoto. Here, he brushed a perfectly round ensō with the following couplet: With a heart permeated with innocence The virtuous dragon walks alone. According to Sen Rikyū (1522-91), Japan's most famous tea master, calligraphy by Zen priests is the most appropriate decoration for the tea ceremony.",
