  "text": "Ensō  means “mark of a circle.” In Zen Buddhism, a circle brushed in a single stroke represents the universe, perfection, and the enlightened mind. As the brush deposits ink, the stroke becomes scratchier, leaving the circle incomplete. This imperfection thus reflects the inevitable discrepancy between the ideal and reality. A skilled calligrapher, Taidō  Sō tō  was the 444th abbot of Daitoku-ji, one of 14 head temples of the Rinzai school of Zen Buddhism in Kyoto. Here, he accompanied the circle with a Chinese poem: With a heart permeated with innocence The virtuous dragon walks alone.",
