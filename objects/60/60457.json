Fuji\\\" series; Bottom column quote (written by Santei Shunba): (I heard Hiroshige the First often say that he was going to give up painting and shake off the dust of the world rather than see his brush lose its power as age crept on him. One day Hiroshige came to the publisher with 36 Views of Mt. Fuji, which he said were his last work, and asked him to engrave them. It was beginning of the last Autumn, and at the close of the Autumn he died, aged 62. I think it was as the proverb says \\\"An insect must have told him\\\", and therefore the publisher whose behalf I write this, has carefully printed them in respectful comemoration of the artist.)",
