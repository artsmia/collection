  "text": "This painting depicts the Chan (Zen) Buddhist monk Xianzi, who retreated into the wilderness to attain enlightenment. Because he was unaffiliated with a monastery (a result of his nomadic lifestyle), he did not adhere to the strict code of vegetarianism for Buddhist monks. Here he holds a large shrimpâ€”he became legendary for collecting them from lakes and rivers. The quick, broad brushstrokes defining his figure and the freely painted calligraphy characterize Chan Buddhist paintings.",
