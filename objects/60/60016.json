  "text": "This painting depicts the Chan (Zen) Buddhist monk Xianzi, who retreated into the wilderness to seek enlightenment. A nomad, he was unbound by monastery rules and did not adhere to the strict code of vegetarianism required of Buddhist monks. In this painting, he is shown holding a large shrimp, representing his legendary habit of collecting them from lakes and rivers to eat. The quick, broad brushstrokes defining his figure and the freely rendered calligraphy are characteristic of Chan Buddhist paintings.",
