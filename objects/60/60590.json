  "text": "This large storage vessel is a classic Han dynasty shape. It is derived from a bronze form and even imitates the molded mash ring handles found on bronze prototypes. The brown glaze is one of the new lead glaze colors introduced during Han. It, as well as green and yellow, became popular in low-fired earthenware such as this.",
