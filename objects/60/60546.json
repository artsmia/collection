  "text": "The form of this circular, covered box is well-known in tenth- and eleventh-century ceramics and silver, but wooden containers of this early date are extremely rare. In the center of the cover is a multi-lobed gold finial engraved with linear details most likely representing a flower blossom. Recent excavations of Liao dynasty (916-1125) tombs in north China and Inner Mongolia have yielded numerous gold, gilt silver and gilt bronze objects. Skillfully worked in repouss√©, much of this gold work was used as decorative accents for utilitarian objects like sword scabbards, leather belts, horse harnesses, or, as the case is here, rather luxurious wooden containers.\r\n\r\nWhen the semi-nomadic Khitans gained control of several northern prefectures in 916, eventually founding the Liao dynasty, they inherited important ceramic kilns along with the Chinese taste for luxury goods.",
