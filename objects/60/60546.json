  "text": "The form of this circular, covered box is well-known in tenth- and eleventh-century ceramics and silver, but wooden containers of this early date are extremely rare. In the center of the cover is a multi-lobed gold finial engraved with linear details most likely representing a flower blossom. Recent excavations of Liao dynasty (916-1125) tombs in north China and Inner Mongolia have yielded numerous gold, gilt silver and gilt bronze objects. Skillfully worked in repouss√©, much of this gold work was used as decorative accents for utilitarian objects like sword scabbards, leather belts, horse harnesses, or, as the case is here, rather luxurious wooden containers.\r\n<BR>\r\n<P>When the semi-nomadic Khitans gained control of several northern prefectures in 916, eventually founding the Liao dynasty, they inherited important ceramic kilns along with the Chinese taste for luxury goods.",
