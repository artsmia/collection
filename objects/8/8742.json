  "text": "Whereas Hokusai’s series on waterfalls may have sprung from a Japanese reverence for natural phenomena, his series on bridges is a cataloguing of different bridge types, from temporary examples to solidly built, permanent structures. Most of the bridges in the series actually existed, but some were legendary and known to Hokusai through literature and folklore. A set of twelve prints likely was intended, although only eleven are known. Two are on view here.\r\nThis bridge is one of two dramatic “drum” bridges at Kameido Tenjin Shrine in Edo. Probably inspired by Chinese “moon” bridges, they were dubbed taiko (drum) bridges. The half-circle form made a full circle when reflected in the water, suggesting the shape of a round drum. By showing the bridge from an oblique viewpoint, Hokusai cleverly revealed the topside planking and also the underside and the support pilings.",
