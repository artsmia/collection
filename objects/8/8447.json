  "text": "This depiction of the historic sage Shakyamuni evokes the moment of his enlightenment when he touched the earth, calling it to witness his awakening. His left hand cradles an alms bowl, and he wears a patchwork robe, both symbols of his asceticism after renouncing his princely birthright. He is flanked by two deities devoted to assisting sentient beings in their quest for spiritual awakening. Lineage masters and benevolent deities surround the divine triumvirate, while wrathful protectors of the faith stand guard beneath the lotus throne.",
