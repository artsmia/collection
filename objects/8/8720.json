  "text": "In this print, Utamaro suggests the low social class of two women through their clothing and deportment. Rather than showing them primly posed with carefully coiffeured hair and luxurious robes, he depicts them with slightly disheveled hair and dressed in simple cotton kimonos. Furthermore, the seated woman has immodestly opened the front of her robe to cool herself with a fan.",
