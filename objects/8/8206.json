  "text": "This is the right sheet of a diptych (two-panel composition) showing five women enjoying an excursion to an iris pond. The woman standing at left wears a sheer purple outer robe with a kasuri (ikat) pattern. Robes in black or purple with such patterns occur frequently in prints from the 1780s, suggesting they were the decade’s popular fashion choice. Many more kasuri patterns are featured in the sample book nearby.",
