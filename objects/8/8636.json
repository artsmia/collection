  "text": "This painting depicts the famous kabuki actor Ichikawa Danjūrō V (1741-1806) as the greater-than-life hero in the play \"Shibaraku.\" In the story, a corrupt warlord and his henchmen terrify innocent people within a shrine precinct. The hero enters the scene via the hanamichi, a raised runway leading to the stage through the audience. In a fierce voice he shouts \"Shibaraku!\" or \"Wait a moment!\" causing the thugs to turn on him. The ensuing fight, with its swashbuckling bravura, is a favorite among kabuki enthusiasts. The dramatic costume, make-up and unusually long sword are all meant to convey his extraordinary strength and vehemence.",
