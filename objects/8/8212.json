  "text": "Prior to 1873, when Japan adopted the Gregorian calendar used in most\r\ncountries, a day was subdivided into twelve segments identified by\r\nanimal signs from the zodiac that originated from China. The hour of\r\nthe goat was between 1 and 3 o’clock in the afternoon. Utamaro\r\ndesigned several sets of beautiful women in accordance with the\r\ndifferent hours of the day, the most famous of which is the series Twelve\r\nHours in the Yoshiwara (Seirō jūni toki) dating from around 1794 that\r\nshows the figures in full length. This print is from a later series showing\r\nthe protagonists up close in half-length. The time of day in question is\r\nthe end of a school day, and we are probably looking at an upper\r\nmiddle-class merchant family. While the older girl in the back is\r\nengrossed in her book, the younger one at the front is presenting her\r\nhandwriting exercise with corrections noted in red to her senior.",
