  "text": "Giovanni Battista Piranesi was an architect who constructed his buildings with an etching needle rather than bricks and mortar. This engraving is one of 135 prints from the Views of Rome, made to sell to travelers who passed through the city on the Grand Tour. It exemplifies Piranesi's fanatical zeal for Roman architecture, which he believed to be the very foundation of Rome's greatness. The Colosseum has had several uses over its lifetime. It was flooded for staging sea battles, it housed a papal munitions depot, and in 1743 it was outfitted with the Stations of the Cross. Piranesi acknowledged this latter function by putting a severely angled cross in the center of the amphitheater.",
