  "text": "Katsukawa Shunsho_ founded the Katsukawa School whose artists specialized in depictions of Kabuki actors. Nevertheless, Shunsho_ was a prolific and versatile artist. Here he depicted two women lounging by an open sliding door (shoji). One has laid aside her shamisen (three-stringed zither) to smoke a long, elegant pipe. A smoking set has been placed on the veranda nearby. The other woman concentrates on writing a love letter with brush and ink. The sweet elegance of the women's countenances and their meticulously rendered robes are hallmarks of Shunsho_'s style.",
