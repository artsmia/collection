  "text": "From 1775 up until the early 1800s, Utamaro designed more than 1,800\r\nprints: the vast majority portrayed beautiful women, the market for\r\nwhich he dominated in the early 1790s. This print belongs to one of his\r\nlater series that portrays six famous courtesans from six different\r\nbrothels. Given that they are all depicted in a relatively relaxed manner,\r\nwe are probably meant to see them in terms of how they behave behind\r\nthe scenes, in private. Hitomoto, who is seen here coquettishly holding a\r\nlong pipe, was the highest ranking courtesan at the Daimonjiya.",
