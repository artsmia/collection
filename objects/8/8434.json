  "text": "The small, independent kingdom of Kaya on Korea's southern coast enjoyed a rich material culture before it was absorbed by Silla, its powerful neighbor to the east, in 562. Bulbous jars with smooth, unadorned surfaces were created in great numbers by Kaya potters, who may also have influenced the production of a similar ware in Japan's Yayoi period (300 b.c. - a.d. 300). This astoundingly large example also has a small amount of natural ash glaze on its shoulder.",
