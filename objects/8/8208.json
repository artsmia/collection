Utamaro also included a cartouche in the shape of a poem card in the upper left portion of the print with a poem by Katsura-no-Mayuzumi that further attests to the allure of Okita:\r\nResting at the tea-house in Naniwaya district, \r\nMyriad as the reeds of Naniwa Bay  \r\nArt those who come running at the name of this shop\r\nEach passerby has to stop.",
