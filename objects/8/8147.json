  "text": "God of wisdom and remover of obstacles both visible and invisible, the elephant-headed Ganesha is invoked at the commencement of any new undertaking or journey.  As the deity's spirit was thought to reside within its likeness, this small bronze statue would thus constitute a perfect traveling companion, guiding its owner towards wise decisions and safe paths.\r\n\r\nA popular Hindu deity, Ganesha was introduced to Cambodian artists in the 7th century.  Over the next five centuries, India's chubby elephant icon was transformed into a sleek, anthropomorphic figure.  He sits meditatively in a classic lotus position, holding his own broken tusk.",
