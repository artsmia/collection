  "text": "Paul T. Frankl looked to New York City’s skyline for his furniture designs. The stepped shapes that make up the arms of this chair echo the city’s skyscrapers, which were required to be terraced in order to allow light and fresh air into the city. Below the seat, this chair’s cutouts also reflect the typical skyscraper shape, which symbolized a desire for progress and a passion for innovation.",
