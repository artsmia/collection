  "text": "A legendary episode that took place in front of Aridōshi Shrine (in modern-day Osaka) provided the subject of this composition. One rainy night, the famous poet Ki no Tsurayuki (ca. 868–ca. 945) came to Aridōshi Shrine while making his way back to Kyoto. He had planned to stop and pray but changed his mind because of the inclement weather. His horse, however, suddenly collapsed at the shrine’s gateway. Tsurayuki took this as a sign that his neglectful attitude had offended the shrine deity. He quickly offered prayers and recited a poem dedicated to the deity. As he uttered the final syllable, his horse miraculously stood up, and Tsurayuki was able to proceed on his way.",
