  "text": "Throughout the 20th century many artists experimented with perception by reducing visual elements to basic geometric forms. Many textile designers have extended this concept to create patterns that are not limited to a single aesthetic concept.\r\n\r\nHere Marjatta Metsovaara, with the use of spiral and circular forms, has created a cheerful pattern that allows the viewer to appreciate the great potential of floral patterning. However, it is interesting to note that if this pattern was used in an environment where classical Modernist elements predominated, the viewer quite possibly might miss the floral possibilities of this textile and focus instead on the geometric design motif.",
