  "text": "The crowning achievement of Jerome's life was his translation of the Bible from Hebrew into Latin, a papal commission with the goal of making the Bible more accessible. This is the context for Saint Jerome in His Study, a print that ranks among Albrecht Dürer's own crowning achievements. Dürer shows himself to be at the height of his descriptive powers, creating phenomenally subtle illusions of reflected light and of textures both cushiony and splintery. His use of perspective places the viewer on a lower step, close enough to share in the warmth of Jerome's cell, but far enough to satisfy the lion, who appears determined that his charge not be disturbed.
