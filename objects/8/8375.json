  "text": "The complex profile of this lamp is reminiscent of an engine piston or a modern-day outdoor heat lamp. Before coming to the United States in 1923, Walter von Nessen trained as an architect and designer in Berlin, Germany. There machines and mechanized production were seen as the basis for modern design, and those ideas are reflected in this lamp. He was instrumental in introducing these concepts to the United States.",
