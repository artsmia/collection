  "text": "In this evocative early Zhe school painting, a scholar-recluse lying at ease near the edge of a cliff listens to the powerful waterfall that roils and boils above his resting place and crashes into the crevasse below. He has set aside his guchin (zither) and book, preferring the entertainment of untamed nature. The scene and its Song dynasty manner derive directly from the classic example of the great academy painter Ma Yuan (active 1180-1225), whose style had tremendous influence on Zhe school painting throughout the Ming period (1368-1644). In this instance, the tight brushwork, solid composition, and relatively coherent space are very close to Song sources. The theme of the qin-playing recluse enjoying a waterfall is perhaps the most popular of all Zhe school subjects. The painting underscores the conscious early Ming revival of Song dynasty (960-1279) forms. Looking back on this golden age of Chinese culture was a way of negating the artistic accomplishments (which were many) of the Yuan dynasty (1280-1368), a period of Mongol control.",
