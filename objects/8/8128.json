  "text": "Kōans are seemingly nonsensical questions that a Zen master would ask his pupils, and among the most famous kōans is this one: \"How to catch a slippery catfish with a smooth gourd.\" In the 15th century, a court painter made the first known painting of this subject. By the early 18th century, a more humorous take on the phrase began to appear in Ōtsu-e, the simple folk paintings that originated in the town of Ōtsu, on Lake Biwa—a monkey hopelessly trying to achieve the impossible.",
