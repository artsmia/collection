  "text": "Rauschenberg's penchant for experimentation and the role of chance was never more apparent than in this editioned lithograph of 1963 that became one of his best known prints. Aptly titled Accident, this rare lithograph was the result of a studio mishap in which the limestone printing matrix was broken during the proofing process. Capitalizing on what he saw as an opportunity, he printed the lithograph from the pieces of broken stone, incorporating gestural brushstrokes and appropriated photographic images into a semi-abstract assemblage. In keeping with his usual working method, Rauschenberg allowed for serendipity and unexpected meanings to emerge, creating an intriguing intersection of content and process.\r\n\r\nThis print was awarded the Grand Prix at the International Print Exhibition V at Ljubljana, Yugoslavia, 1963.\r\n",
