  "text": "Related to the play \"Ayatsuri kabuki ōgi\" (Mastery of the Fan in Kabuki) performed at the Nakamura Theater in the seventh month of 1768. The five actors on the right are the Five Chivalrous Commoners that performed in one act of this play: Arashi Otohachi I (1711-1769) as Hotei Ichiemon, Matsumoto Kōshirō III (1741-1806) as Gokuin Sen'emon, Nakamura Sukegorō II (1745-1806) as Kaminari Shokurō, Ichikawa Komazō II (1737-1802) as Karigane Bunshichi, and Ichikawa Yaozō II (1735-1777) as An no Heibei.\r\nOriginally attributed to Katsukawa Shunshō, the facial expressions of the actors as well as the date of painting make an attribution to Bunchō much more plausible.",
