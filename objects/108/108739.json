  "text": "Dinka men used to dress lightly—until recently, they simply covered their torsos in tight, beaded corsets, highlighting their lithe figures. But these garments did more than that: the colors of the beads signal social and marital status as well as the wearer’s age. Red and black means a young man between 15 and 25 years old.",
