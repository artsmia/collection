  "text": "Jacopo Palma il Giovane was influential in the generation after Titian, Jacopo Tintoretto, and Paolo Veronese. During the last quarter of the 16th century, Palma became the most esteemed artist in Venice and was hired to paint allegorical scenes for the interior walls of the Doges Palace, the seat of Venetian government. Later in life, Palma painted mythological subjects for Venetian intellectuals, and this study of Venus and Adonis dates to that period.",
