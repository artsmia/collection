  "text": "<I>Punchus</I>, or ponchos, became popular in the Andes during Spanish colonial rule (1533-1825). Following a Native uprising in the 1780s, the Spanish viceroy forbade tunics, believing them to be a source of indigenous nationalism. As an alternative, men began wearing ponchos, which were essentially tunics with open sides. They were quickly embraced as a new symbol of Native identity. Ironically, the Spanish military also appreciated the versatility of ponchos, adopting them as part of their uniform. ",
