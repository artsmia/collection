  "text": "A female devotee known as the Bhairavi Ragini worships a Shiva linga in a temple with two lady assistants.  Dressed in the yellow robes of a holy woman, she watches her attendants offer milk and garlands to the god's aniconic form.  Shiva's vehicle, a bull, sits below the temple and beside a silver lake.  Ragamalas are musical modes personified by women, a widespread subject in illustrated manuscripts of regional Indian courts.",
