  "text": "Stephen Mark Paulsen delights in creating controlled fantastic environments, utilizing his skills in turning on a tiny scale and as many types of woods and other materials as possible. His statements add to the evocativeness of these imaginative tableaux. I try to reveal those places, within us and without us, where past and future coexist, beyond fashion and geography, eternally, while time flies. In <I>Beast Chamber</I>, are we to believe that a quiet domestic environment or temple offering has been intruded upon, or that it is indeed the lair of the spiky, dinosaur-like monster?",
