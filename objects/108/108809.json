  "text": "Stephen Mark Paulsen delights in creating controlled fantastic environments, utilizing his skills in turning on a tiny scale and as many types of woods and other materials as possible. His statements add to the evocativeness of these imaginative tableaux. \"I try to reveal those places, within us and without us, where past and future coexist, beyond fashion and geography, eternally, while time flies.\" In Beast Chamber, are we to believe that a quiet domestic environment or temple offering has been intruded upon, or that it is indeed the lair of the spiky, dinosaur-like monster'",
