  "text": "This portrait of  Prince Bhawani Singh (r. 1867-1885) of Sitamau with his courtiers and attendants, portrays the prince's power and authority as he rides out on a hunt.  Hunting dogs and attendants carrying rifles precede the prince and his entourage, who ride on magnificent steeds.   The most important individuals in the group are identified by adjacent written inscriptions.\r\n\r\nThe painter has rendered the hunting party's attire in exquisite detail.  The prince's armor is a fine silver and gold chain mail, and his courtiers wear sashes at the waist that they might have received as gifts from him. The horses are also richly adorned and depicted as individualized beasts. Equestrian portraits were a common way to honor noblemen at this time, and this group portrait would have been a particularly costly commission.",
