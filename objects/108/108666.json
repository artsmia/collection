  "text": "This mask is the oldest in the exhibition. Its age is revealed by the appearance of the wood, the rich surface crust, and the necessity of 'replacement holes' along the edges to which the costume used to be attached. The holes on the snout held a piece of fur, which would have intensified the animal-like look of the mask. ",
