  "text": "Moore's mother, a fan of early modern wood turner Bob Stocksdale, taught him wood turning in the 1950s. Moore's subsequent degree in sculpture prepared him to experiment with metal in his wood objects; he is now one of the few wood artists to explore this combination of materials. His metal elements, spun on a lathe and patinated, are integral to his designs. \r\n\r\nMoore's Tray for Apollo reinterprets the ancient Greek kylix form on a larger scale and in different materials. It could be a container for an offering, or more likely, meant as a drinking cup suitable for one of ancient Greece's most prominent gods.",
