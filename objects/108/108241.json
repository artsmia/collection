  "text": "The Fluxus group was an international collective of artists who in the 1960s and 70s sought to subvert the sometimes high seriousness of art by introducing unconventional ideas and activities such as games, puzzles, storytelling, performance, absurdity, chance, poetry, and experimental music and film, into the realm of fine art. The group was famous for their large output of Fluxus boxes or so-called Fluxkits—small wooden or plastic boxes that held collections of printed cards, games, puzzles, found objects, and other material along with operating instructions for the viewer to perform certain actions or activities. Indeed, active participation was a required element of these works. Fluxus art was also noted for the experimental mixing of mediums, or what became called \"intermedia,\" as a way to generate unforeseen meanings or associations.",
