  "text": "In this large-scale print, a heavy male figure lies on his side with his head cradled in one arm. Unlike most of the images in this room, this reclining figure does not celebrate the beauty or eroticism of the human form. Crudely sketched in black, this naked slumbering figure is set against a dark red background that suggests a sense of impending danger. \r\nSouth African artist William Kentridge is internationally known for his politically-inspired art. He often focuses on the issue of social responsibility, an especially powerful subject for those who experienced the violence and hatred created by South African apartheid. In Sleeper Red, Kentridge portrays a male figure (based on his own self-portrait), to represent the archetypical white South African who, by birthright, benefited from this anti-democratic political system. As such, the figure becomes a symbol of all individuals who fail to stand up to social injustice or are otherwise compliant with human suffering.",
