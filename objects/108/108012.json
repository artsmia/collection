  "text": "Jan Lutma, Goldsmith, pays homage to one of the grand old men of Dutch art at the time. Lutma, then in his seventies, was a master of the auricular forms fashionable earlier in the century. He holds a statuette, and on the table beside him are a hammer and a cup full of punches—the tools of his trade—as well as a dish featuring sensuous curvilinear contours for which he was famous. Though Rembrandt portrays Lutma as physically past his prime, he also gives him the penetrating gaze of a sharp mind still at work. The exceptionally neat inscription identifying the sitter may have been applied to the plate by Lutma’s son, who was both a goldsmith and a printmaker.",
