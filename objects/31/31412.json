He quickly established a reputation for high-quality craftsmanship opening shops in Berlin, Paris, London, and New York. He is best known for his blending of classical and Art Nouveau elements with modernist forms. In this set the ornate ladle handle complements the handle of the bowl, creating a repetition of forms when together.",
