  "inscription": "(Shigemori was a sword master of the Shintō school. He joined the 47 ronins with his son Tadaemon. Although he was fifty-some years old, he fought valiantly. During the fight, he\\'d mistaken Moronō\\'s san Moroyasu as his father. While he was going to kill the son, he heard the whistle signaling that Moronō was killed by somebody else. As soon as he heard the news, he rushed to the gathering place. Thus he missed the chance to kill Moroyasu.)\r\n\r\n{Shigemori wa Shintō ryū kenjutsu no tatsujin nari.
