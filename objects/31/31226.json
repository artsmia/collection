  "text": "Stupa-form reliquaries were used during T'ang (618-906) by priests performing ceremonial worship. Ancient paintings show vessels like this placed on altars in front of Buddha images. Such containers usually held relics of a Buddhist saint (<I>Sarira</I>), or small precious objects that represented these persons.\r\n\r\n<P>The domed cover is surmounted by a stupa-form knob symbolizing different stages of Buddhist existence. A similar reliquary was discovered in 1983 among the remains of a T'ang dynasty pagoda in the vicinity of the Lungmen cave temples at Loyang.\r\n",
