Coat of arms: those of Sawbridge-Erle-Drax with Grosvenoer in pretence, probably for Johan Samuel Wanley Sawbridge of Olantigh Towers, Kent, Holnest House, Co. Dorset, and Ellerton Abbey, Co. York (1800-1887). He married in 1827 Jane Frances, sister and sole heiress of her brother Richerd Erle-Drax-Grosvenor, M.P., of Charlborough Park, Dorset (dd. 1828). By 1853, Burke's Visitations of Seats and Arms, vol. 2, records this latter house as the seat of John Samuel Wanley Erle-Drax, M.P., Captain of the East Kent Militia.
