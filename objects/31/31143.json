  "text": "This colorful scroll was once part of a Water-Land Ritual <I>(Shuilu)</I> set of paintings used in Buddhist mortuary rites honoring the souls of the dead. Two groups of figures are identified by inscriptions written in gold on banners flying over their heads. The eight figures wearing armor in the lower portion of the painting are generals who died for their country in ancient times. In the upper right corner dressed in official costume are meritorious civil officials of the past.\r\n<P>The three figures in the upper left corner represent popular Daoist gods associated with prosperity and the family. One carries fish, a symbol of abundance, and another is surrounded by small children. Skillfully executed in bright colors with touches of gold, the scroll exhibits the compositional complexity often associated with Ming dynasty Buddhist painting.",
