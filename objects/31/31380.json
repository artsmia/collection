Coat of arms: those of Sawbridge-Erle-Drax with Grosvenoer in pretence, probably for Johan Samuel Wanley Sawbridge of Olantigh Towers, Kent, Holnest House, Co. Dorset, and Ellerton Abbey, Co. York (1800-1887). He married in 1827 Jane Frances, sister and sole heiress of her brother Richerd Erle-Drax-Grosvenor, M.P., of Charlborough Park, Dorset (dd. 1828). By 1853, Burke's Visitations of Seats and Arms, vol. 2, records this latter house as the seat of John Samuel Wanley Erle-Drax, M.P., Captain of the East Kent Militia.

  "text": "This wine cooler is from a set of four in the Institute's collection inspired by the \"Buckingham Vase\" excavated on the grounds of the imperial villa at Tivoli, outside Rome (AD 118-130).  The Buckingham Vase, a 46-inch high marble urn acquired by the first Marquess of Buckingham, was portayed in engravings published by  Italian artist Giovanni Battista Piranesi.  While not exact copies of the original vase, the wine coolers retain the classical urn shape and feature the same cavorting Erotes (winged gods of love) cavorting among twining grape vines and leaves.",
