  "text": "This wine cooler is from a set of four in the Institute's collection inspired by the Buckingham Vase excavated on the grounds of the imperial villa at Tivoli, outside Rome (AD 118-130).  The Buckingham Vase, a 46-inch high marble urn acquired by the first Marquess of Buckingham, was portayed in engravings published by  Italian artist Giovanni Battista Piranesi.  While not exact copies of the original vase, the wine coolers retain the classical urn shape and feature the same cavorting Erotes (winged gods of love) cavorting among twining grape vines and leaves.",
