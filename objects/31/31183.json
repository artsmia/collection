  "text": "Green Tara is one of the most revered female bodhisattvas,and is worshipped for the ability to overcome obstacles. She is associated with the cosmic Buddha Amoghasiddhi, and transmits his wisdom to the worshipper. Remarkable for its size and age, most of this statue is made from separate pieces of hammered sheet copper (repouss√© technique) fastened together with rivets. Certain features like the crown, hands, and earrings are cast bronze. Although the lower legs are missing, the bejeweled goddess sits in the posture of relaxation, wherein the left leg would have rested parallel to the base while the right leg was pendant. Her right hand, opened in the \"gift bestowing\" gesture, originally rested on her right knee. The deity's left hand once held the stem of a lotus which blossomed at her shoulder",
