  "text": "Green Tara is one of the most revered female bodhisattvas, a being who postpones enlightenment to assist others on earth. She is the companion of the Cosmic Buddha Amoghasiddhi and equally transmits his gifts to the worshiper. Remarkable for its size and age, this statue is made from pieces of sheet copper—some now missing—that were hammered, formed, and fastened with rivets. The deity’s right hand, opened in the gift- bestowing gesture, would have rested on her right knee. Her left hand once held the stem of a lotus, which blossomed at her shoulder. An embodiment of infinite compassion and worshipped by those seeking to overcome obstacles, Tara is often depicted at the height of her beauty, inspiring a hymn recorded by the First Dalai Lama (1391–1474): \r\n\r\nThrough the Magic of Lokeshvara’s compassion \r\n\r\nThe Three times Buddha’s wisdom, love, and power \r\n\r\nAppear in the lovely form of the Goddess of Action. \r\n\r\nWho saves us all from want—at Tara’s feet I bow!\r\n\r\n . . . Showing the union of wisdom and art— homage to you.",
