  "text": "A popular Chan (Zen) Buddhist personality, Hanshan is known mainly through the Tang dynasty (618–906) anthology Cold Mountain Poems (Hanshan shi). The poems describe the friendly hermit as wearing simple clothing and living a carefree life as a wanderer on Cold Mountain (“Hanshan”). Here, an unkempt Hanshan is shown sitting cross-legged, holding a brush beneath a tree tangled with vines. The inkstone and scroll on the ground beside him identify him as a poet.",
