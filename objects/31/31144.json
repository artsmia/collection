  "text": "A popular Chan (Zen) Buddhist personality, Hanshan is known mainly through the Tang dynasty (618–906) anthology <I>Cold Mountain Poems</I> (<I>Hanshan shi</I>). The poems describe the friendly hermit as wearing simple clothing and living a carefree life as a wanderer on Cold Mountain (“Hanshan”). Here, an unkempt Hanshan is shown sitting cross-legged, holding a brush beneath a tree tangled with vines. The inkstone and scroll on the ground beside him identify him as a poet.",
