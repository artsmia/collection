  "text": "This handbuilt vessel has been stamped with a wave pattern on its upper half and  the lower half with a woven stamped pattern. The raised patterns create a greater amount of surface area on the exterior of the pot which in earthenware can cool the contents. This jar is made of stoneware which does not allow saturation of the clay body and thus no cooling occurs. A new technology at the time, high-fired stoneware is much more durable and thus the vessel will last longer. A few centuries later the stamped patterns were used in bronze as potters, experienced in high-firing techniques, were recruited to create vessels in that new medium.",
