  "text": "A devotee might pray to Sangay Donyotrubpa (Sanskrit: Amoghasiddhi) to overcome envy and greed and to transform those emotions into the wisdom of accomplishment. One of the Five Cosmic Buddhas of the cardinal directions (north, south, east, and west), Sangay Donyotrubpa presides over the celestial realm of the North. He is associated with the color green (his partner is Green Tara) and with the elements of wind and air. Here, his right hand gracefully gestures “have no fear,” while his left hand rests in his lap in a meditative position.",
