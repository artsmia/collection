  "text": "A devotee might pray to Amoghasiddhi to overcome envy and greed, attempting to transform these emotions into the wisdom of accomplishment. One of the Five Cosmic Buddhas of the cardinal directions (north, south, east, and west), Amoghasiddhi presides over the celestial realm of the north. He is associated with the color green (his partner is Green Tara) and with the elements of wind and air. As if receiving a breeze, Amoghasiddhi’s sash billows while his right hand gracefully gestures “have no fear.”",
