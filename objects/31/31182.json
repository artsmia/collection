  "text": "A devotee might pray to Amoghasiddhi to overcome envy and greed, attempting to transform these emotions into the wisdom of accomplishment. He is one of the five cosmic Buddhas who are crowned and wear jewel ornaments. Associated with the color green and the elements of wind and air, Amoghasiddhi is believed to occupy the northern section of the five directions. His right hand is raised in the “have no fear” gesture. This sculpture is part of an elegant group of bronzes, probably from western Tibet, that displays masterful craftsmanship and stylistic links to Indian sculpture from the Pala period (700s to 1100s). The eyes are inlaid with silver, and red pigment remains in the necklaces, crown, and hair ornaments.",
