  "text": "One of Belgium's leading Art Nouveau designers, Gustave Serrurier-Bovy began producing his inexpensive Silex range of furnishings in 1902.  The series consisted of ready-to-assemble furniture in kit form motivated by his firm belief that everyone should have access to beautiful furniture.  Individual pieces were usually made of light woods, such as pitch pine, and were relatively simplified forms employing circles and squares laid out in symmetrical arrangements.",
