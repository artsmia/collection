  "text": "The famous metalwork master Hu Wenming (1573–1620）from Songjiang, Jiangsu province (near Shanghai), was one of the most accomplished craftsmen of the late Ming dynasty. He specialized in archaic-style gilt-bronze ritual vessels for the incense stand and scholar’s desk. His work was highly regarded by the educated elite of the wealthy in the Jiangnan region (lower Yangzi delta). This bottle-like vessel derives from a prototype of the Western Zhou bronze wine vessel zhi, but now served a different purpose. \r\nThe vase, like its Bronze Age prototype, is decorated with designs of lingzhi mushrooms, orchids, and narcissi—all favored motifs of the artists. The vase bears an incised four-character inscription on the bottom, identifying it as work by Hu or, more properly, from his workshop. A complete set of incense vessels comprises only three items: an incense burner, a covered box, and a vase such as this one to hold the small metal tools required for burning the aromatic wood.",
