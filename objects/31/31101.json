  "text": "Can’t quite figure out what you’re looking at' The photographer’s acutely angled view up the side of a tall building with small, protruding balconies emphasizes the abstract quality of this Bauhaus structure. Prellerhaus was a dormitory building completed in 1926. Its twenty-eight studio apartments were rented to some of the most promising artists and designers of the Bauhaus, a school founded by the architect Walter Gropius with the idea of uniting fine art and craft. The Bauhaus style, characterized by simplified forms and an emphasis on structure and materials, later became one of the most influential aesthetics in modern design.",
