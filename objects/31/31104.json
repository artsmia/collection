  "text": "Grete Stern and Horacio Coppola met while they were both students at the Bauhaus, the famous German school of architecture, art, and design. These images are still-lifes, featuring everyday objects photographed with the unusual angles and lighting typical of Walter Peterhans, then the head of photography at the Bauhaus. After the school was closed by the Nazi regime in 1933, Stern and Coppola fled to London and then to Buenos Aires, where they became leading figures of avant-garde photography.",
