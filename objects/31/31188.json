  "text": "A painting decorates the interior of one of a pair of wooden bookcovers, which would have enclosed a sacred Buddhist manuscript. At the center, a portly male with bulging eyes, identifiable as the enlightened mystic Virupa, sits next to an unidentified guru, most likely from the Sakyapa order, which regarded Virupa as particularly important to its lineage. Virupa points to the sun, commanding it to stay in its place, illustrating a story in which he promised a bartender that he would pay his bill (and stop receiving drinks) only when the sun set. The background is filled with multiple representations of Amitabha, the Cosmic Buddha associated with the western direction.",
