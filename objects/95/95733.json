  "text": "Women wore head coverings out of modesty; men wore them out of pride. In India and Pakistan, a man's turban (pagri) was an assertion of his dignity, inseparable from his sense of honor.  \r\n\r\nThe turbans on display are particularly fine examples of various resist-dyeing techniques known generically in the West as 'tie dye.'   Many tie-dyed designs were worn equally by men and women, their suitability determined by season and occasion rather than gender.",
