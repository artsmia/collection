  "text": "The nine-square motif is very popular in the  Asante culture. Asante weavers use the nine-square motif in three distinct named cloths, each differentiated by ground cloth patterns and the designs used in conjunction with it.  The design element, placed on a simple indigo and white ground, becomes a large-scale, all-over pattern that conveys a powerful graphic quality. In this configuration it is called Akyempem, A Thousand Shields, a pattern that is believed to have originated during the reign of Osai Tutu in the 18th century. It refers to military prowess and bravery, symbolizing the idea that the wearer knows no fear.The border is quite traditional, with its alternating nwatoa, babadua surrounding two long rows of the adwen 'nkyemfre', which symbolizes the maxim 'unity in strength.'",
