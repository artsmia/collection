  "text": "The Mumuye of northeastern Nigeria are known for their striking, often asymmetrical figures. Defining characteristics include elongated bodies, wing-like arms, and small heads with stylized faces. While most of them are sexless, female figures can be recognized by the presence of holes in the earlobes - as is the case here. Such ritual sculptures could be used by diviners, healers, judges, and rainmakers. Some served as status symbols for important elders.",
