  "text": "Aguilar's sense of drama and liveliness as she approaches her work is evident in this depiction of Adam and Eve.  Despite the lushness of the garden surrounding her, Eve's eyes are directed upwards, to the snake engaging her in conversation, and behind him, to the winged devil nestled in the trees.  Adam seems captivated by Eve, peering eagerly around the tree to see her.  The apple rests in her hand, as yet uneaten, but the viewer is left in no doubt about where this scene will end.",
