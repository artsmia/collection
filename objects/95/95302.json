  "text": "One common technique used in the flower-and-bird painting is daoyun, a reverse-saturation method where the flowers or plants are left in reserve, as areas of white against an ink-wash ground. The method emerged out of the painter's attempt to capture the brilliant whiteness of blossoms and plants in moonlight, or in a winter setting as seen in this scroll.",
