  "text": "One technique commonly used in the flower-and-bird painting tradition is daoyun, a reverse-saturation method in which the flowers or plants are left as negative space—areas of white against an ink-wash ground. The method emerged from painters’ attempts to capture the brilliant whiteness of blossoms and plants in moonlight—or in winter, as seen in this scroll.",
