  "text": "This probing sketch for a portrait draws upon new artistic conventions owing much to innovations in studio photography. Nineteenth century India saw rapid developments in the photographic medium, and the artist Ghasiram, who had trained in traditional Indian painting styles, was the first to paint portraits that integrated photographic realism.  This sophisticated watercolor study might have been made by one of his followers. Ghasiram was also something of a social reformer and accepted apprentices from diverse castes, helping to break down communal barriers.",
