  "text": "This rare handscroll, depicting various types of traditional trees and rocks, was painted by the great artist Dong Qichang (1555–1636). The work was intended for studio use as a type of sourcebook for Dong’s personal style of depicting trees and rocks, which he blended from the styles of previous masters. Sketchbooks, scrolls such as this, and printed manuals were commonly used as reference materials and teaching devices in Chinese painting workshops. This particular scroll was once in the possession of the literati artist Chen Jiru (1558–1639), a close friend and follower of Dong Qichang. Chen’s inscription reads:\r\nThis is Xuan Zai’s (Dong Qichang’s) sketch of trees and rocks by various old masters. Whenever he made a large composition, he copied from these sketches. After his house was burned down, I chanced to acquire this scroll from a professional mounter. It must not be shown to Dong lest it provoke his anxiety.\r\nRemarks by Meigong (Chen Jiru).",
