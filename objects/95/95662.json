  "text": "The shape of this elegant, volumetric bowl, with its simple, bold form is probably derived from metalwork introduced from Persia or Central Asia. The style of bowl was originally used in Indian Buddhist practice. The begging bowl (bo) was a monk's necessity and the Chinese produced them in metal, lacquer, and ceramic. The ceramic versions were for daily use and the spontaneously applied glaze with runs and drips was a style favored in the sixth century, especially during Northern Qi (550-577).",
