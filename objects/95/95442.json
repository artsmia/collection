  "text": "When Sonia Delaunay met poet-publisher Jacques Damase in 1964, she discovered the kindred spirit she had missed all her life. Their book collaboration shows they were indeed on the same page: Her trademark curved and straight lines match the bold insistence of Damase's text. He extols the magical power of art, which, Delaunay believed, had its essence in the internal rhythms expressed by contrasting colors.",
