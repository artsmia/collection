  "text": "Sword manufacturing was introduced to Japan from the Asian mainland. The earliest known types of swords were straight and mostly 23 1/2 to 27 1/2 inches in length. They were made of bronze and used for stabbing as well as striking. Higher-ranking warriors on horseback carried <I>tachi</I>, swords that hung from the belt with the cutting edge facing down. The 1300s saw the development of a new type of sword called <I>uchigatana</I>, which warriors carried in the belt with the cutting edge facing up. <I>Uchigatana</I> were better suited for foot soldiers and became the sword most commonly used by the samurai, the warrior class, who needed a weapon suited to changing battle conditions. With its curvature near the tip, the blade offered a faster response time, enabling the warrior to draw and strike in a single motion. <I>Uchigatana</I>-type swords with a blade length of approximately 23 1/2 to 28 1/2 inches came to be known as <I>katana</I>, and shorter blades as <I>wakizashi </I> (average 20 inches). To use both swords for fighting was uncommon, and on the battlefield it was customary to carry a <I>katana</I> and a more practical short dagger (<I>tantō</I>) with a blade length between 6 and 12 inches.",
