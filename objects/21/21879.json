  "text": "Guests to a tea gathering were invited to smoke tobacco in a pipe like this one. Smoking usually took place in the anteroom of the teahouse or in the garden between the major parts of the gathering. Occasionally, though, a host would invite his guests to smoke within the tearoom itself, particularly during the less formal service of <I>usucha</I>, or “thin tea.”\r\n\tThe illegible signature of a metal artist appears on the underside of this pipe’s mouthpiece. He decorated these metal portions of the pipe with a delicate design of butterflies flitting among autumn flowers such as chrysanthemums and bush clover.",
