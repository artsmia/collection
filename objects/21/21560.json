  "text": "Built in the 1200s, Morpeth Bridge was the crossing point of the River Wansbeck—thus a strategically important asset on the main route between Newcastle and Edinburgh. The view is taken looking downstream to the east. The north and south abutments and the center pier still survive, but in 1835 the arches were destroyed when a larger bridge was built a stone’s throw further downstream. Beyond the north (left) end of the bridge, we see the arched tower of a chantry chapel built in 1296. Besides praying for the chapel’s patron, the priest collected the bridge tolls.\r\n\r\nThis drawing is traditionally attributed to Thomas Girtin, but it may be a copy after his work. A closely related watercolor is in the Laing Art Gallery in Newcastle. Is Mia’s a copy or was the artist a forerunner to Claude Monet and the Impressionists, exploring the effects of different lighting upon the landscape'",
