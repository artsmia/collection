  "text": "Sturdily constructed with little more decoration than its cloud-scroll shaped apron spandrels, this is an example of a standard recessed-leg table intended for practical use. Both square and rectangular tables were used as portable work surfaces throughout a Chinese household. Generally, legs set back from the end of the table top are stronger than those set on the corners, and this placemat was typically employed in furniture intended for rigorous use.",
