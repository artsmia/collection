In Guatemala, each Catholic church has one or more cofrad√≠a, or religious brotherhood, that is responsible for caring for the figures and for obtaining small garments to clothe them. In many villages, the task of weaving the saints' clothing is given to the most accomplished weaver and carries a great deal of honor and prestige.",
