  "text": "This three-piece ensemble was a festive outfit of a Yoruba man from Nigeria. It is made from blue and white cotton strip-woven cloth, which has been sewn together to create a large fabric. The white rayon or silk embroidery, which decorates the hem of the pants and hat, and the hem and neckline of the tunic, is characteristic of Nigerian clothing. The checkered pattern of the fabric, however, is exceptional, and striking to onlookers.",
