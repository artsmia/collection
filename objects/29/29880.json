  "text": "In the eighteenth, nineteenth, and early centuries, child-sized tea and dinner services were given as toys to help introduce table manners.  The toy services could be an exact miniature of the real wares, giving a child practice at handling delicate ceramics.  In addition to the toys in this case, note the modern German child's dishes elsewhere in this gallery, and the 1830s transferware set in the MacFarlane Memorial Room.",
