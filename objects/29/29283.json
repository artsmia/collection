  "text": "The <i>Homemaker</i> tableware pattern, featuring iconic modern furniture designs, was available for purchase at Woolworth's stores between 1955 and 1967. For a modest cost, shoppers could bring home tableware with depictions of contemporary favorites, including the famous boomerang coffee table by Isamu Noguchi, and a settee inspired by Finn Juhl's Danish teak designs. As part of the trend to promote modernism in postwar interiors, the <i>Homemaker</i> plate joined fabrics and wallpapers from the period that featured playful illustrations of modern decorative arts objects.",
