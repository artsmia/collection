  "text": "The Homemaker tableware pattern, featuring iconic modern furniture designs, was available for purchase at Woolworth's stores between 1955 and 1967. For a modest cost, shoppers could bring home tableware with depictions of contemporary favorites, including the famous boomerang coffee table by Isamu Noguchi, and a settee inspired by Finn Juhl's Danish teak designs. As part of the trend to promote modernism in postwar interiors, the Homemaker plate joined fabrics and wallpapers from the period that featured playful illustrations of modern decorative arts objects.",
