  "text": "Glazing techniques improved greatly between the eleventh and eighth centuries BCE. Large quantities of high-fired glazed stonewares similar to this jar have been excavated in the Yangzi River area at Dunxi in Anhui province and at Chuzhou in Zhejiang province. Surface decoration is achieved by incising, impressing with molds, and with wheel-made grooves. The olive-green glaze, derived from a two-percent iron oxide compound, can be considered a form of celadon. The distribution of high-fired glazed ware during Western Zhou was far-reaching with examples found in Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Shanxi, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang provinces in north central and south China.",
