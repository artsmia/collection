  "text": "In many villages, a woman's festive huipil is simply the one that is the newest. This is very likely the case in Tactic, as most sources do not differentiate between ceremonial and everyday garments. Tactic weavers produce two distinct styles, however. The older style is distinguished by the vertical zigzags that dominate the central panel; the newer style features repeating patterns of traditional Maya imagery. Both garments display finely executed, dense brocade, but perhaps the sheer virtuosity of the weaving on the lower example and the use of silk thread elevates it to a ceremonial status. ",
