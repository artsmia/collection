  "text": "Birds could convey good wishes and greetings through the puns on their names, which conjure up verbal associations with lucky ideas. Xique (magpie), for instance, is an auspicious bird whose caw heralds the approach of good fortune. Its name in Chinese forms a pun on the word xie (\"happiness\" and \"joy.\"). Together with the plum blossom, a flower blooming in late winter and representing renewal and heralding spring, the composition expresses a good wish: \"Magpies herald the arrival of the spring\" (xique baochun).",
