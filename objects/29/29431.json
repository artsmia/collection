  "text": "Birds could convey good wishes and greetings through the puns on their names, which conjure up verbal associations with lucky ideas. <I>Xique</I> (magpie), for instance, is an auspicious bird whose caw heralds the approach of good fortune. Its name in Chinese forms a pun on the word <I>xie</I> (happiness and joy.). Together with the plum blossom, a flower blooming in late winter and representing renewal and heralding spring, the composition expresses a good wish: Magpies herald the arrival of the spring (<I>xique baochun</I>).",
