  "text": "Serpents are a recurring theme in Maya mythology and are variously referred to as a plumed serpent, feathered serpent, double-headed serpent or sun serpent. They all appear to be related K'uk'ulkan, a Maya god who participated in the creation of the earth and humanity. The serpent plays an important part in Maya iconography and is found in a variety of forms on Maya textiles. In this huipil it is symbolized by the 'S' shaped motif, but the horizontal, rayed zigzag is also said to represent this mythical being. Cintas, the long, narrow ribbons used to wrap and tie women's hair, are said to be another manifestation of serpent imagery.",
