  "text": "One of the more unusual uses of lacquer during Ming and Qing was the production of inkstones. This circular stone has the right texture and porosity to make a good grinding utensil yet it is lighter and easier to carry than a stone or ceramic version. The circular cover of the fitted box is decorated with the filled-in and engraved-gold technique (<I>tianqi</I>). It displays ginkgo leaves, longan berries, cherries, and lychee on top with a more formal lotus scroll motif decorating its side register. All of these auspicious plants are outlined in gold and the general style can be seen as a revival of the Wanli period (1573-1619). The bottom of the base bears the mark of Lu Tong, a late eighteenth-early nineteenth-century lacquer artist.",
