  "text": "Rebecca Cauman created this unusual pair of hand-hammered bookends, which feature stylized orange trees, by using metal foil and enamel in a medley of bright colors. The whimsical images recall children’s book illustrations. A certified master craftsman with the Society of Arts and Crafts in Boston, Cauman also marketed her creations. From 1928 into the 1940s, she and her sister Josephine featured handcrafted silver, pewter, and copper objects, including her own designs, at their retail shop on Madison Avenue in New York City.",
