  "text": "Throughout her career, conceptual artist Lorna Simpson has explored matters of gender, race, and history pertinent to the lived experience of Black Americans. Physicality is often central to her investigations, especially in the presentation and perception of bodily strength and vulnerability. Presented like jewels or relics in a sleek wooden box, these three wishbones materialize the fragility and preciousness of living beings—and of their dreams.",
