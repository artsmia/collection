  "text": "The <i>hu</i> wine or water vessel evolved from the late Shang (c. 1300–1046 BCE) to the Han dynasties (206 BCE–220 CE) and took a great variety of forms. During the Warring States period, this type of round <i>hu</i>, with its bulging belly, tall neck, and rimmed foot, became one of the most popular bronze vessels. In keeping with contemporary taste, it was relatively undecorated, sometimes with the exception of several raised bow strings, or flat bands, encircling the body. Most have ring handles (often in the form of animal masks) on the shoulders and a slightly domed lid embellished with three knobs in stylized animal form. In this example, there is an inscription engraved near one animal mask, which reads <i>“xin li, </i> indicating the location of the workshop in Chang’an, capital of the Han dynasty.",
