  "text": "This inkstone is carved in the form of a winnowing basket (簸箕), a favored shape during the Tang dynasty (618–907). The artisan carved the light-grained stone to reveal a dark striation in the center of the well that simulates puddled ink. The small scale and fine condition suggest that this was an object made exclusively for burial.",
