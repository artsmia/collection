  "text": "The talismanic quality of a plant underlies the belief that planting certain flowers near one's home or placing them on the gates would protect the household from evil. The long-bladed grass of the sweet flag (Acorus calamus), with its strong aroma, was believed to ward off poisonous insects and evil forces. Therefore it was customarily hung on doors on the occasion of the May (Duanwu) Festival on the fifth day of the fifth moon. The figure with his hand holding a sword is Zhong Kui, a deity who exorcises ghosts and evil spirits. His image is often painted on household gates as a guardian spirit, as well as in places of business where high-value goods are involved.",
