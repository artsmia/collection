  "text": "This tea caddy was inspired by the heavy neoclassical furniture pictured in the influential design periodical Ackermann’s Repository of Arts. It could well be a miniaturized version of a sideboard that appeared there—a flat-topped piece meant to be placed against a wall, with cupboards and drawers for storing dishes, glasses, and table linen.",
