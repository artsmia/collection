  "text": "In keeping with his practice of repurposing common materials for his art, Rob Fischer used assembled sections of reclaimed oak flooring to fabricate this printing matrix (woodblock), which the Highpoint Editions workshop used to produce his editioned print Dodgeball (2020.85.44a,b). When inked and printed using relief (surface) and intaglio (incised) methods, the resulting prints reveal the characteristic grained and textured appearance of the oak boards, including the residual scratches and flaws that existed in the reclaimed material.",
