  "text": "Each of these three photographs encapsulates a moment during Adrian Piper’s performance Food for the Spirit, which she held in her apartment during the summer of 1971. She isolated herself from the world while writing a paper on the philosopher Immanuel Kant’s book Critique of Pure Reason. She also fasted and practiced yoga. To counteract the sense of her selfhood dissolving, she photographed herself before a mirror and recorded herself reciting Kant’s words. The camera, mirror, and recorder, and eventually the photographic print, all seem to confirm her continued material existence.",
