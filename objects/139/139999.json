  "text": "If this assemblage reminds you of tools neatly suspended on pegboard, there is good reason for it. Tracy Krumm deliberately references functional items—baskets, pouches, doilies—by creating abstract nonfunctional forms. She began “Index (Autobiography)” at age 50 with the idea of creating one sculpture—each composed of a household item acquired from relatives or friends and a crocheted element of her own making—for every two years of her life.",
