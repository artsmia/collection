  "text": "Members of the nobility wore insignia surcoats over dragon robes during formal court ceremonies. These surcoats were dark, full-length gowns decorated with dragon roundels in accordance with the rank of the owner. Because all four of the upper roundels in this robe have front facing, five-claw dragons with <I>shou</I> roundels above their heads, the coat undoubtedly belonged to an emperor.",
