  "text": "This robe belonged to a high-ranking abbot, indicated by the numerous five-clawed dragons embroidered in gold. Large peony blossoms decorate some of the squares as well, with leafy tendrils in shades of red, pink, blue, and green. The patchwork-like design of the robe is accentuated by bindings of ivory satin that mark off the various squares. In the borders and larger dragon panels appear depictions of coral, swastikas (Buddhist symbols of good fortune), and other symbols among celestial waves and stylized clouds.",
