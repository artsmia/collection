  "text": "Jacob Hurd was one of five of the most prominent Boston goldsmiths between the 1720s and 1750 and was one of the most talented engravers of this period, influencing the designs of numerous others. His skill is evidenced in the delicately engraved border of this salver. Unfortunately, some of this fine work is no longer visible in the center cartouche's engraving as the original coat of arms or initials have been removed by a previous owner. Small waiters such as this were often used as stands for coffeepots to prevent the hot vessel from damaging the surface of the table beneath.",
