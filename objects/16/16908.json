Each panel in this set illustrates two of the eight immortals with their attributes: LÃ¼ Dongbin with his emblem, a sword, slung across his back, and Zhang Guolao, holding the yugu, a kind of musical instrument in the shape of a bamboo tube (first panel); Zhongli Quan, with a bare belly, holding a fan in his hand, and Han Xiangzi, performing on the flute (second panel); Cao Guojiu, with a characteristic court headdress and official robes, holding a pair of castanets, and Lan Caihe, who carries an elixir of immortality such as a lingzhi fungus (third panel); He Xian'gu, the only female figure of the group, carrying a lotus leaf that bears a peach, and Li Tieguai, holding a pilgrim's gourd from which a scroll is escaping, emblematic of his power to set his spirit free from the body (fourth panel).",
