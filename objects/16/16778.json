  "text": "This cover is an extremely finely woven fabric, without the addition of painted pigments to enhance the design. Decorative table covers are relatively rare in Qing textiles. The phoenix imagery and technical refinement of this panel suggest it may have an imperial provenance. The cover depicts a central phoenix roundel surrounded by twelve identical roundels on a lotus-scroll grid pattern.",
