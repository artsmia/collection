  "text": "This hand-painted gray silk gauze <I>daopao</I> (robe with sleeves) is a rare example of a priest’s summer garment. On the front are auspicious animals and plants—including dragons, cranes, peaches—and <I>yin-yang</I> symbols. On the back, a pagoda flanked by dragons is encircled by discs representing twenty-eight constellations and, beyond these, diagrams of the five sacred mountains. Twelve roundels contain depictions of the zodiac animals.",
