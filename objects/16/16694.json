  "text": "Grid schemes are decorative arrangements dispersed in regular patterns across a robe's surface. They served as a backdrop to the imperial and auspicious imagery on the robe. Patterns such as swastika frets, water chestnut lattices, and stylized floral repeats were popular throughout the nineteenth century. The precision with which these complex designs were created represents one of China's greatest technical achievements in silk embroidery.",
