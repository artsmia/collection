  "description": "Imperial robe of blue k'ossu with gold swastika-fret diaper ground.  Nine 5-clawed dragons in gold, those in profile clutching the Heavenly Jewel.  On the ground are scattered loose clouds and bats in shades of blue, green, red, pink, soft violet, olive green and yellow. Conventional border of slightly wavy stripes in gold and black threads; tight clouds; rolling waves in gold and black threads with symbols of the Eight Precious Things and branches of coral.  Below border on sleve, a strip of blister ribbed black silk.  Cuffs of greyed-blue K'ossu with bats, clouds, dragons etc.  Note stronger violet color in cuffs which are obviously a later addition.  Collar band is of black K'ossu with body designs and is edged with blue and gold brocade.  Coat slit front and back and lined with thin blue silk.  K'ossu badly broken on right shoulder.",
