  "text": "The Nasca warrior on this polychrome painted vessel holds a sling, a very common weapon in the Andes where warriors almost always relied upon blunt weapons to defeat and capture enemies. Slings are uncomplicated weapons used by warriors, hunters, and herders. Today, slings still play a role in ceremonial mock battles, or tinku, waged between Andean communities during important festivals.",
