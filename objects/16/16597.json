  "text": "This vest might have been worn by an aristocratic bride over her wedding robes. The insignia square—a special image specifying one’s rank—depicts a white egret, indicating that the woman’s husband was a sixth-degree official. It was common for husbands and wives to bear the same insignia on their clothing, so that when they were seated together the animals would face each other. The rest of the vest is decorated with auspicious imagery, including imperial dragons, bats, peaches, phoenixes, and peonies. After the wedding, the vest would continue to be worn by the woman on formal occasions.",
