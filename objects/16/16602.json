  "text": "Eight golden dragons cavort across this imperial robe, while a ninth hides under the front fold of the skirt. These dragons are part of the twelve symbols of imperial authority and are arranged on the robe according to official dress edicts put into effect in 1759. The sun, moon, mountain, and constellation emblems are positioned symmetrically around the neckband. The other eight imperial symbols—dragon, ax, cups, flame, bat, grain, pheasant, and waterweed—are arranged on the front and back of the robe. Only the top members of the royal family—emperor, empress, empress dowager, and crown prince—could wear twelve-symbol robes. A bright yellow dragon robe like this could be worn only by the emperor himself.",
