  "text": "While these silk banners would have only been used by the imperial court within the Forbidden City, their context was similar to this; flanking a shrine or an ancestor portrait above an altar table. The poetic verse invokes a heavenly constellation along with a wish for the emperor's longevity.\r\n<P>The banners read from right to left:\r\n<P><I>The court glows in rose color when the torches are lighted;</I>\r\n<P><I>May the exalted one enjoy long life forever and ever and ever;</I>\r\n<P><I>May he always see the light shining upon his great empire</I>.\r\n\r\n<P><I>The propitious mist lusters the marvelous touches when the melodious heavenly music is performed;\r\n<P>the lofty central axis Mount Song is guarded by immortal isles.</I>",
