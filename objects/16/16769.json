  "text": "Silk <I>kashayas</I>, probably belonging to high-ranking abbots and senior monks, are more sumptuous than the cotton and hemp robes worn by the general priesthood. This robe is a ceremonial object of imperial sponsorships accounting for the inclusion of imperial imagery with gold dragons cavorting within the imperial landscape. Buddhist outer robes are cut as a horizontal rectangle designed to be draped over the left shoulder, under the right arm, and fastened under the left shoulder with ties. The ritual garment is fabricated from small squares and panels that are outlined in bias strips of yellow silk. Ironically, this convention symbolizes the humble nature of the clothing of Buddha, who having renounced wealth, made his garments from discarded and donated cloth fragments. While this kashaya was woven in an imperial workshop, expensive silk brocade donated by the lay public, were typically cut into smaller fragments and reassembled by the priesthood in a token effort to avoid the appearance of luxury.",
