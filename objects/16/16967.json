  "text": "Intertwined chrysanthemums and leaves decorate the borders and panels of this robe, which are arranged in a staggered patchwork pattern. Chrysanthemum flowers express autumnal solitude, embodying purity in their yellow blossoms—a symbol of the pureness of the Buddha.\r\nThe only panel without this design is at the top center of the border, a visual representation of the Three Treasures of Buddhism: Buddha, Dharma (the teachings of the Buddha), and Saṅgha (the monastic order of Buddhism). Buddhists symbolically take refuge in the Three Treasures to express their faith.",
