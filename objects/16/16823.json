  "description": "Rare temple hanging of leaf green brocade. All-over pattern composed of various square, octagon, and trefoil bordered medallions, each beating floral sprays or stylized blossoms. The medallions all carry floral or diapered borders, producing an effect of great richness and intricacy. The color is chiefly green, with shades of red, blue, yellow and pink contributing a lightness to the scheme. Border of gold and blue brocade of interlocking 'Y' design. The piece is made up of two widths sewed together, and is limed with a fine eggshell silk with wild goose medallions in openwork. Medallions also carry two characters of rather archaic flavor.",
