  "text": "Willow, cottontail, and black martynia or devils claw, are the main materials used to sew baskets of the Akimel O’othom and Tohono O’odham.  The availability of these plant fibers in the environment aide in identifying differences between the two tribes’ baskets.  The Akimel O’othom who live along the river and few streams have easy access to willow and cottontail, which is reflected in their designs being predominantly black patterns on a white background.  The Tohono O’odham, who live in the desert where black martynia is more abundant, predominantly use a black background with white designs.",
