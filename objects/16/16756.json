  "text": "Because this textile was used as a chair cover, we can see four distinct design areas that conform to the shape of a traditional Chinese chair. The textile would have been draped over the top rail, flowing down the back of the chair and across the seat with an overhang in the front. The motif in the bottom section includes deer, peaches, fungus (known as <I>lingzhi</I>) and cranes – all symbols of long life. The motifs in the square design (the seat of the chair) include lotus and bats, signifying happiness. The celestial dragon on the back of the chair is a symbol the imperial court.",
