  "text": "This robe comprises over 100 rectangular pieces. Arranged in a staggered pattern, each panel repeats the same three motifs, embroidered in gold thread: a spotted deer at the bottom, the character shou (longevity) in the center, and a bat at the top (which has the same sound as another character, fu, meaning “fortune,” and is therefore a symbol for blessing). A small panel depicting a seated Buddha is featured at the top center of the robe.",
