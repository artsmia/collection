  "description": "Altar frontal of pale brick red kesi with design representing a blue-scaled chilin in a field of flowers, large fat clouds, and symbols in shades of blue, green, pink, yellow, brown and grey. Across the top a band of watery, run-together clouds.(?) Note the bat, of finer, later kesi inset above cloud over chilin's head. Double border inner one of worn, all-over flower and cloud pattern of brocade in shades of light green, yellow, blue and pink; outer of gold and blue kesi of dragon and cloud pattern, perhaps originally part of a robe? The kesi weave is quite coarse. It has been badly worn, and is mended in places. Lining of yellow satin which has been pieced out.",

  "text": "This panel includes a large mythical animal associated with rulers and power. The beast, called a qilin, sits within a landscape of flowers and symbols of good fortune. It was altered sometime after it was made; the upper section was removed and a double border was added. The outer border appears to come from a dragon robe dating to the late 1600s. Look closely to see the small bat above the qilinâ€™s head. It is in a different style and of a finer technique than the rest of the fabric, so it was likely a later addition, perhaps added along with the borders.",
