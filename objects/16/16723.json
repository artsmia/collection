  "text": "This panel includes a large mythical animal associated with rulers and power. The beast, called a <i>qilin</i>, sits within a landscape of flowers and symbols of good fortune. It was altered sometime after it was made; the upper section was removed and a double border was added. The outer border appears to come from a dragon robe dating to the late 1600s. Look closely to see the small bat above the <i>qilin</i>’s head. It is in a different style and of a finer technique than the rest of the fabric, so it was likely a later addition, perhaps added along with the borders.",
