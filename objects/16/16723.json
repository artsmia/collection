Across the top a band of watery, run-together clouds.(?)   Note the bat, of finer, later kesi inset above cloud over chilin's head. Double border inner one of worn, all-over flower and cloud pattern of brocade in shades of light green, yellow, blue and pink; outer of gold and blue kesi of dragon and cloud pattern, perhaps originally part of a robe?
