Across the top a band of watery, run-together clouds.(?)   Note the bat, of finer, later k'ossu inset above cloud over chilin's head. Double border inner one of worn, all-over flower and cloud pattern of brocade in shades of light green, yellow, blue and pink; outer of gold and blue k'ossu of dragon and cloud pattern, perhaps originally part of a robe? The k'ossu weave is quite coarse. It has been badly worn, and is mended in places. Lining of yellow satin which has been pieced out.",
