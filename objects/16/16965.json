  "text": "The Manchus formed an hereditary banner system in 1601 that required all Manchu men to be enrolled in one of the four banner regiments. The original regiments were distinguished by their solid yellow, white, red, and blue triangular flags with serrated borders. Prince Dorgon commanded the white regiment. Flags such as these embellished with dragons in couched gold were used primarily in ceremonies and military reviews like those depicted below in the Eight Formations handscroll, rather than in battle.",
