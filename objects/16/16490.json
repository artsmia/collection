  "text": "The exact role of this garment is unclear, but its colorful nature and lack of religious decoration suggest it may have been intended for a female character at a special occasion. In fact, as the collar is wider and more elaborate than more traditional collars on womenâ€™s robes at the time, the character wearing it may have been Tibetan or connected to Tibet in some way.",
