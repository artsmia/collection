  "text": "In the early 1900s, many Euro-American women traveling through the Southwest region of the United States became infatuated with miniature Native American baskets, and some became avid collectors. Native women basketmakers responded to this demand by creating ever-smaller baskets, which tourists could easily carry home and display in their curiosity cabinets as emblems of their worldliness and taste. Kate Koon Bovey, of Minnesota, was one of these travelers, and in the 1940s she gave nearly a hundred tiny baskets to the Minneapolis Institute of Art.",
