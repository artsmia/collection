  "text": "Distinguished by its gold tapestry ground, this garment displays the “one hundred children” theme, which can be found on porcelain, lacquer, and paintings as well as textiles, especially those associated with the marriage ceremony. Since the Manchu ethnic group avoided figural imagery on these garments, this type of subject matter is found almost exclusively in the clothing and pictorial hanging of the Han Chinese.",
