  "text": "This robe is comprised of 100 staggered rectangular panels, each containing an image of the Buddha seated on a lotus pedestal, surrounded by flames. The figures take alternating poses: some sit with hands placed together in their lap in the <i>dhyana mudra</i> (contemplative gesture); others hold an alms bowl. The top and bottom-most rows alternate with panels depicting lotus blossoms.\r\n\r\nThe decorative arrangement of this <i>kashaya</i> is based on the Thousand Buddha theme that flourished in China starting in the 6th century, during the Northern Wei dynasty (386â€“535), and was popularized in Central Asia between the 7th and 9th centuries.",
