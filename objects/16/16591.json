  "description": "Emperor's twelve-symbol robe of fine k'ossu in shades of blue and white.  Nine five-clawed dragons, those in profile grasping the Heavenly Jewel.  This robe, of the blue color worn in sacrifice to the Heavens, bears some of the twelve ancient ornaments reserved for the emperor alone; the sun, the moon, and the constellation are present.  Others appear only in part toward side seams of garment, indicating that the robe was cut down - perhaps from K'ang Hsi for Yung Cheng?  Border pattern of rather short slanting waves, topped with floral forms where stripes curl into waves, is similar to border in 42.8.9.  Loosely drawn cloud forms, bats, and Happy Augury signs in ground.  Note single flower springing from waves to right and left of mountain motif in fornt and back- collar, band, and cuffs of same motifs on ground of darker blue k'ossu.  Coat slit at sides and lined with light blue silk.",
