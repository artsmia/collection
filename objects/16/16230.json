  "text": "Historical evidence suggests that aprons were first developed to provide metaphysical protection and focus power on feminine fertility.  Over a period of time aprons evolved into a practical form of physical protection for special clothing, as well as being a decorative panel.  The embroidered rooster, a symbol traditionally associated with fertility, may be an unconscious reference to the apron's original use.",
