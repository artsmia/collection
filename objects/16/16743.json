  "text": "While Manchu women wore full-length informal gowns with square cuffs, the Chinese women of the Han majority wore shorter, loose-fitting robes with wider sleeves than their Manchu counterparts. These were generally calf length garments worn over the standard wrap-around skirt. This stunning, special-occasion robe features a scattered scheme of peonies and cicada moths in red cut velvet against a gold ground. The outer cuff bands display the \"hundred antiques\" motif in light green cut and voided velvet. The twelve-petal yoke and side and hem bands are embroidered with women in a multicolored landscape setting on a white ground. The cicada symbolized regeneration and eternal youth. When combined in flower or garden settings, it represented the harmonious coexistence of all things in nature.",
