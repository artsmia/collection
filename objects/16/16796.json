  "text": "Like most theatrical costumes, this colorful two-piece military outfit is an exaggeration of real-life apparel. Elaborate studwork, metal-wrapped threads that are stitched onto the silk, and padded applique lion masks adorn the shoulders and waist, simulating riveted plate armor. The costume is one of several purchased during the 1920s from the stock of a theater within the emperor’s court compound, the Forbidden City.",
