  "text": "The supply and demand of the market that grew between the Euro-American tourists and the Akimel O’othom and Tohono O’odham basket makers demonstrate the tribes’ high level of ingenuity and productivity.  Novelty items invented by Native artists include waste paper baskets, animal and human effigies, and miniatures of popular basket forms.  The smallest basket here measures only one half inch in diameter.  The use of animal and human figures in the basketry was another result of the tourist market, as consumers sought after designs that were easily recognizable.  Yucca plant also replaced willow and cottontail in many instances because it grew in abundance in the desert surroundings and took little time to prepare for weaving. ",
