  "text": "This <i>kashaya</i> is elaborately decorated with auspicious symbols such as lanterns, vases, dragons, and phoenixes. Some of them—such as the lotus, white elephants, white horses, and lions—have strong Buddhist associations. The symbols are organized in a patchwork design, fabricated from small squares sewn together or woven to represent such squares. Despite its lavish appearance, this convention symbolizes the humble nature of the Buddha, who made his garments from discarded and donated cloth fragments. It was appropriate for Buddhist monks, in their humility, to fabricate their own patchwork clothing.",
