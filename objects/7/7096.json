  "text": "One of Peche's (pronounced Peck-a) finest works, this centerpiece bowl blends the clean lines of early Wiener Werkstätte designs with an animated serial pattern. Hand-hammered into an extremely thin silver layer, the piece is a perfect compliment to Hoffmann's centerpiece bowl of the same period. The quest for geometric simplicity pioneered in the workshop's early years gave way to an ornamental revival in the '20s and '30s. Peche, especially, introduced a flamboyant exoticism in his later work.",
