  "text": "The faithful have come to pay homage to Pan, the god of Arcadia-the woods, fields, and other wild places. Centaurs, satyrs, and humans come together to celebrate the life force that Pan represents. Here the long-lived Jean-Jacques Lagrenée operates in a light-hearted mode of Rococo art. Later in his career, his interest in antique themes would be channeled into the more austere style of Neoclassicism.",
