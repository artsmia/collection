  "text": "Apollo and Artemis were the divine twins of the god Zeus and the Titaness Leto. Apollo, the Sun god, was a master musician who delighted the gods on Mount Olympus. He is also associated with prophesy, sickness and medicine. Artemis (later worshiped by the Romans as Diana) was the goddess of hunting and archery, as well as the Moon goddess. Apollo and Artemis shared the heavens, she beginning her journey across the sky in the evening, just as he finished hi day journey.  Her attributes include the bow (here borrowed by Apollo) and the faun.  \r\n\r\nDuring this year Durer was making proportional studies of nudes,of which a number remain.  The influence of Mantegna's hard-edged sculptural effects and characteristic responding curves is also evident.",
