  "text": "At the end of the 19th century, folding screens modeled on Japanese formats were important accents in the most modern and chic Parisian dwellings. Many European artists tried their hands at the screen format. In Nursemaids' Promenade, Pierre Bonnard effortlessly arranged his scene across four panels. The stylized forms and innovative composition echo Japanese examples, but Bonnard made it his own by including a fashionably dressed Parisienne and her children situated below a frieze of carriages.",
