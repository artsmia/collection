  "text": "Samson conquered a lion bare-handed, which makes his vulnerability to the wily Delilah especially ironic. His story epitomizes the misery that comes from yielding to passion. Samson is so smitten that he foolishly tells Delilah the secret of his strength (his hair), information she will sell to his enemies. Although she does not do the hair-cutting in the Bible, artists typically give this villainy to her. After a picnic, she weakens the great hero who had an unfortunate weakness for women.",
