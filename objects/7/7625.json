This stretch of Minnesota highway landscape, devoid of construction zones, pedestrians, potholes, or opposing traffic, is a driver's dream, a hyperreality simulation featuring an actual windshield wiper. Minnesota Morning was printed and fabricated at the Vermillion Editions Limited workshop in Minneapolis.",
