  "text": "Noted for his Pop-inspired imagery of iconic American highways and road signs, Allan D'Arcangelo's witty three-dimensional representation is an imaginary visualization of the open road as seen from the driver's seat. This stretch of Minnesota highway landscape, devoid of construction zones, pedestrians, potholes, or opposing traffic, is a driver's dream, a hyperreality simulation featuring an actual windshield wiper. Minnesota Morning was printed and fabricated at the Vermillion Editions Limited workshop in Minneapolis.",
