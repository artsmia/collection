  "text": "By the end of the 1960s, Joe Tilson had become intensely involved in anti-authoritarian politics, portraying such figures as Ho Chi Minh, Malcolm X, and the Argentine-born physician and Marxist firebrand Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara (1928-1967). Guevara began his political and social activities in Guatemala and later served as Fidel Castro's chief lieutenant during the Cuban revolution that toppled the corrupt regime of Dictator Fulgencio Batista. After unsuccessful efforts to foment socialist revolution in Africa and South America, Guevara was captured and murdered without the benefit of a trial in 1967 by soldiers of the Bolivian army. With the help of declassified government documents, the United States Central Intelligence Agency was implicated in the assassination of Guevara as well as the cover-up that followed. In a macabre and cruel act, Bolivian soldiers cut off Guevara's hands to provide proof that he was actually dead. In the wake of his slaying, Guevara became a martyr and a symbol for socialist revolutionary movements throughout the world.",
