  "text": "The ceremonial appearance and considerable size of this twelve-armed candelabrum make it among the most compelling of German Art Nouveau (Jugendstil) metalworks. The arms swivel around the central shaft forming a three-dimensional tree form or, as here, may be arranged with the arms in a row suggesting a stylized peacock. Designed in 1901, it was being sold in several sizes by the Vereinigte Werkstätte until at least 1914. To date, few versions of this candelabrum have been recorded.",
