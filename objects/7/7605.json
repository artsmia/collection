  "text": "Masami Teraoka uses the conventions of 19th-century Japanese ukiyo-e woodblock prints to create absurdist parodies of consumerism, pollution and greed. It's a style he developed after moving to Los Angeles in 1961 at age 25, when Pop art was hitting its stride. A major theme is the way American tastes are imposed on other cultures. In noting Teraoka's undercurrent of lusty imagery, Asian art expert Howard A. Link refers to his snake-like tongues devouring ice cream cones. For his palette, Teraoka draws inspiration from his family's kimono shop.",
