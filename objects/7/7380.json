  "text": "Käthe Kollwitz grew up in a family devoted to radical social reform. While still in school, she realized that her gift was as a draftsman rather than as a painter. She used printmaking as a vehicle for promoting awareness of the plight of Germany’s impoverished working class, particularly women. Whether confrontational or muted, as in <i>Working Woman with Blue Shawl</i>, the emotional intensity of her imagery has earned her recognition as one of the most important printmakers of her era.",
