  "text": "Architect-designer de Groot, is perhaps best remembered for his interior design for the new LZ-129 Hindenburg, the ill-fated Zeppelin, which made its maiden voyage across the Atlantic in 1936. This centerpiece bowl clearly anticipates the utilitarian designs of the Hindenburg. Its side profile reads as one continuous thin line; when viewed from above, it appears to be an unadorned disk hovering in space.",
