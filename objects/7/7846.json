  "text": "Étienne Delaune's grace and precision earned him a place as engraver and goldsmith to Henri II (1519-1559). Like other French kings, Henri identified with ancient heroes such as Hercules, a fact reflected in the art of his court. Here the demigod holds a celestial sphere above two captives. A Delaune print of the huntress Diana in an identical format was the model for an enameled medallion found in the inventory of Henri II's jewels.",
