  "text": "Wealthy Dutch merchants eagerly paid to have their status immortalized by eminent artists like Hendrick Goltzius. Jacques de la Faille commissioned these portraits the year he married Josina Hamels. Instead of using his portrait to proclaim his business acumen, however, he presented himself in his role as a commander of the Antwerp civic militia. Weaponry fills the lower region while a drummer and halberdier command the upper margin. By contrast, Hamels's border is more allegorical, with a lute player and the peacocks of the marriage goddess, Juno. ",
