  "text": "This panorama, the banner tells us, is a \"Truthful picture of the praiseworthy imperial town Nuremberg toward the west.\" Hans Lautensack was justifiably proud of his city's skyline, punctuated by the twin spires of St. Sebaldus and St. Lorenz. To affirm the accuracy of his view, Lautensack showed himself sketching in the right foreground as onlookers point out details. The strapwork cartouche carries the coat of arms of the German Empire, flanked by the arms of Nuremberg (left) and the Nuremberg castle (right).",
