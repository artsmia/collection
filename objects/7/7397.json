  "text": "Whistler's etchings made in Venice are among the most innovative of his career. His experiments with light and dark shapes and figures produced a remarkable degree of abstraction in his Venetian views. In Two Doorways, light human figures emerge from the dark doorway, which is framed with light stone. Whistler plays with similar effects for the gondoliers past the second door, near the bridge further along the canal.",
