  "text": "Celmins's prints address four major themes--ocean, sky, desert, and the galaxy--which she interprets in black and white in a multitude of variations. Working primarily from photographs, she creates detailed but enigmatic images which offer the viewer no sense of scale, perspective, or movement. As in this lithograph, her subjects appear frozen in time, a gray forbidding world without beginning or end.",
