  "text": "One of the most noteworthy metalsmiths working independently in American during the '30s and '40s was the German-born Müller-Munk. His work reflected a European sophistication that attracted many private clients. Among his most celebrated streamline designs is the Normandie pitcher so named because its front knife-like edge echoes the bow of the great luxury liner Normandie. Resisting the obvious, the handle projects out at a slight rakish angle giving the overall form a softer silhouette, as well as facilitating pouring.",
