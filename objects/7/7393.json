  "text": "To recoup a series of financial losses in the late 1870s, James McNeill Whistler returned to a subject that had served him well in the past: scenes along the River Thames. He chose London's most picturesque bridges to appeal to the same audience who had loved his Thames Set. Old Putney Bridge was taken down in 1880, so choosing to immortalize this bridge had special significance. While these images proved popular, Whistler nevertheless needed to declare bankruptcy later in the year.",
