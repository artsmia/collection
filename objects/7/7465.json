  "text": "As one of his twelve labors, Hercules had to capture the cattle of the monstrous Geryon. He succeeded, only to have Cacus, a fire-breathing monster, steal some of the cattle, hide them in his cave, and then block the entrance with a boulder. Hercules used his great strength to break into the cave and beat the thief to death. The Master of Year 1515 takes a ribald approach to Cacus's misery, sandwiching him between Hercules and the horse so Cacus is scarcely discernible. The most prominent feature of the entire print may be the horse's rump.",
