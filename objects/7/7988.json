  "text": "In his day, Hugh Bolton Jones was best known for his paintings of New England meadows. His landscapes reflect ideas of the Hudson River school, a group of painters who imbued their depictions of the American landscape with drama and emotion. Winter Landscape also shows Jones experimenting with the Impressionist style in his color choices and brushstroke technique.\r\n\r\nConservation of this painting was made possible by a generous contribution from Douglas and Mary Olson through the Art Champions program.",
