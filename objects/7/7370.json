  "text": "The Giant Sphinx Moth depicted at bottom right is Cocytius antaeus (Drury), shown with its larva and pupa. The adult feeds through its long, tubular proboscis, which is formed from two parts. Merian drew the larva feeding on a plant known as the Bellyache Bush, because all parts of the plant are poisonous, particularly the seeds. Marian noted that the leaves of this plant were used for \"purgatives and for enemas.\"",
