  "text": "Saint Mark, author of the second New Testament gospel, is identified by his emblem, a winged lion. Though known only by the initials that appear on eighteen prints within a coherent group of more than 300, Master E.S. is regarded as the dominant printmaker of the 1450 and 60s in Germany. E.S.’s tendency toward fine detail, decorative elements, and a shallow sense of space suggest training rooted in goldsmithing. These traits may be seen here in the minute rendering of Mark’s face and hands, the elaborate folds of the drapery, and the way the ground tips toward the viewer.",
