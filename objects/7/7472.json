  "text": "At first glance an erotic romp in the woods, Robetta's allegorical print deals with the darker theme of the vanity of earthly things, namely carnal pleasure. The woman with the wreath in her hair is probably Voluptas, the goddess of pleasure. The putto at right tries to pull the man away from Voluptas while standing on a skull, making him the personification of Death. The putto opposite holds poppies, indicating that he may be Hypnos, the child of Night, who gives mortals dreams of foolishness. Such details ally Robetta's engraving with the \"death and the lovers\" theme so popular among artists in the North.",
