  "text": "The Kiss is a subject that Munch returned to several times from 1895 to 1902. He first explored the motif in a painting and an etching before embarking on this woodcut version, which stresses a more simplified, abstract composition. In this print, Munch cut the figures out of one block of wood, roughly gouging away the faces and hands. Over this he printed a piece of wood with a strong vertical grain in a light shade of grey, making it seem as if the kiss is as elemental as nature itself. The result is an image with a profound resonance, a timeless symbol of intimacy and unity.",
