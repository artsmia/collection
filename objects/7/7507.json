  "text": "This 17-foot vertical triptych, one of Rauschenberg's largest prints, features content of a more personal nature, including a full-body x-ray of the artist; an astrological chart (Libra); biographical passages arranged in concentric rings; a childhood photograph; and a documentary photograph of the artist's first dance piece Pelican (1963). Printed on a commercial press designed for billboard advertisements, this offset lithograph was intended to serve as a widely distributed broadside, an advertisement of sorts for the artist himself. As in other prints that date from the late 1960s, Rauschenberg has moved away from the use of brushstrokes and other handwork, instead relying solely on juxtaposed photographic imagery for the work's content.",
