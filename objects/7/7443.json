  "text": "The marvelous visionary feeling that swirls around Domenico Campagnola's Assumption of the Virgin is one of its great charms. In the story of the Assumption, which became Roman Catholic dogma only in 1950, the apostles convened at Mary's deathbed and again three days later, when she rose up toward heaven. The men are animated by gestures of excitement as the Virgin ascends, adding to the flow of movement. The adopted son of Giulio Campagnola, Domenico hatched his shadows in varying directions so they, too, bristle with energy.",
