  "text": "In Roman mythology Rhea Sylvia was the mother of Romulus and Remus, the legendary founders of Rome.  She had been one of the Vestal Virgins, who were required to preserve their chastity.  When she became pregnant (she said by the god Mars), her evil brother Amulius had her buried alive, the punishment given to Vestals who violated their obligation.  Her twin boys were cast into the river Tiber but were rescued and raised by a shepherd, and grew up to found their own great city.\r\n\r\nDürer has been the strongest influence in Aldegrever's early work, but about 1530 he adopted the Mannerist style.  The traditional mythological theme of Rhea Sylvia allowed Aldegrever the opportunity to depict muscular nudes in twisted, Mannerist poses, modeled with emphatic contrasts of light and shadow. He continued to sign his works with the <I>AG</I> monogram, clearly inspired by Dürer's famous <I>AD</I> monogram.",
