  "text": "José Clemente Orozco was one of the greats of Mexican muralism. He took a break in the late 1920s to go to the United States, both to paint murals (including ones at Dartmouth College and Pomona College) and to create lithographs. Orozco's vision was darker than most, tending to show the failures of the Mexican Revolution and his mistrust of political systems. Requiem is one of his most acclaimed prints. Full of strong diagonals and solidly massed forms, it is a study of profound grief. Yet amid the pathos, Orozco tells us, the strength of Mexico's people endures.",
