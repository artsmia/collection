  "text": "Louis XVI's reign spanned the tumultuous years of 1774-1792. This print--which proclaims the king \"Restorer of Liberty\"--was published shortly before Louis XVI was convicted of high treason and sentenced to death by guillotine. Bervic's meticulous reproduction of the opulent costume and elaborate setting of Callet's official state portrait of the king could not have been more ill-timed, yet the artist proved to be an enterprising printmaker. During the Revolution, he symbolically broke the plate in two, which seemed to help his flourishing career during the Republican period, and then, after the Bourbon Restoration in 1814, soldered the plate back together again, to pull impressions from the plate again, although the later edition is distinguished by a stark white line running through the middle of the print. This pristine impression is a rare early state, executed before Louis XVI's arrest.\r\n \r\nEach leader is set amid majestic columns and billowing drapery and assumes an elegant dance-like pose and an impenetrable gaze. Roughly contemporaries, Washington and Louis XVI also wear similar hair-styles, knickers, and shoes, and display tricorn hats and swords at their hips, a symbol of their military might. Also, both portraits incorporate fasces, bundles of wooden rods signifying unity and justice. In the French portrait these sit above the oval relief depicting Justice, and in the American painting, they appear as the table leg.\r\n \r\nThere are important differences between the portraits, to be sure. Far from Louis’s royal ermine cloak embroidered with fleurs-de-lys, Washington wears sober black, and there are no diamonds on his shoe buckles. Instead of holding a scepter and pointing to a crown and a hand of justice, the president steadies his hand on a desk strewn with papers and books—symbols of a rule founded in enlightened principles and just laws. Washington is also shown not raised on a dais but directly on the floor. Despite the aloof power Louis XVI exudes in Bervic’s print, he would be arrested and beheaded ",
