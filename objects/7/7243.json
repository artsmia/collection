  "text": "The American Impressionist painter Childe Hassam was prolific and hugely successful. Of deeply conservative mindset, he denounced Cubism, Expressionism, and other modern trends in art. His lithographs, including the present nude, are composed of staccato strokes and zigzags that favored vibrant patterning over atmospheric subtlety. The irony is that the result closely approximated the work of the very Expressionists whom she scorned, particularly that of Otto Mueller, the self-styled outsider.",
