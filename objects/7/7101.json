  "text": "The rich, gilt interior of this dish is unveiled when the lid is upturned.  The lid's ball elements function as feet as well as handles.  In 1937, the Brooklyn Museum exhibited this as a \"Double Vegetable Dish,\" suggesting the lid can also serve as a second serving dish--an added economy.\r\n\r\nIn addition to silver, Kogan's freelance work included Bakelite jewelry, Zippo  lighters, melamine tableware, doll furniture, and more than 100 designs for Minnesota's own Red Wing Pottery Company (many of which have a \"B\" before their model number).  In 1994, the Industrial Design Society of America recognized Kogan as America's first professional woman industrial designer.",
