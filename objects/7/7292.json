  "text": "Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec used flat, bold colors and forms to create this stunning poster of Aristide Bruant, a popular Parisian cabaret singer. When the Ambassadeurs, one of the largest café-concerts of the day, engaged Bruant to perform, he insisted that Toulouse-Lautrec make this advertisement of his show. Bruant was known for his use of street slang and rowdiness on stage, and Toulouse-Lautrec successfully captured Bruant's commanding personality in this lithograph.",
