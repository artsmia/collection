  "text": "This sheet is the only Saint Lucy by Master I. I. CA in the United States, and one of just six known impressions in the world. As if having molten lead poured into her ears, being pulled by four oxen, and suffering a dagger to her throat weren't enough, this martyr had yet another trial with which to contend. Notice the eyeballs she holds skewered on a stick. In this episode of her legend, an admirer was so enamored of her eyes that Lucy plucked them out and sent them to him on a dish. She later recovered her sight, which is why she is invoked for protection against eye disease.",
