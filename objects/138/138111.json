  "text": "Miriam Schapiro, a leading figure in feminist art, was an innovator in several ways. Eurydice brings together two critical aspects of her practice in a visually spectacular way. She had been an active abstract painter and was known in the 1950s for her energetic gestural paintings. That fluidity with paint is evident in the center of the painting, which seems to be on fire with color. Surrounding that opening are collaged fragments of fabric that Schapiro constantly collected. She called this combination of paint and fabric, “femmage” as an explicit nod to the female, even matriarchal origins of the materials she used. Made the year in which she and Judy Chicago formed, theorized and gathered momentum around the feminist art movement, it shows her creatively firing in all directions, alive to the new possibilities that these forms could take and inspire.",
