  "text": "Sonia Gomes examines memory and identity through sculptures made of wire structures wrapped with fabric, thread, gifted, and found materials. The organic sculptures take up space, acting as a placeholder for the absent and unseen body that has been historically marginalized. Her Torções series (meaning “torsions”), mimic not only torsion of the body in movement but also relate to the sculptural process of their making. Her\r\nworks refer to the body as a way of decolonizing the past and reclaiming the present, reconstructing and cele- brating the self and Gomes’ African heritage.",
