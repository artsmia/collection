  "text": "It is dawn. Angels have pulled aside the sarcophagus lid, and now—framed by clouds and a heavenly aureole—Christ hovers above his empty tomb. Soldiers in fanciful armor surround the tomb: some sleeping, some just roused, and others actively attempting to understand the miracle before them.\r\n\r\nAlbrecht Altdorfer was one of the foremost artists of Renaissance Germany. With the collaboration of a woodblock cutter whose name we do not know, he made this image with lines so fine that they rival the art of copper plate engraving. Note how the figure of Christ is printed more darkly than the rest of the image, thereby giving him added presence.",
