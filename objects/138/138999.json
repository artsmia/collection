  "text": "Diane Itter was a prominent American fiber artist and meticulous colorist. She is best known today for her knotted and fringed works, but in the early phase of her career she explored intricate color interactions – her lifelong interest – through loom based works of art. Tapis III was the last tapestry she created. At its culmination she concluded that tapestry weaving, as she preferred to do it and which included hand-dyeing woolen weft threads, was too time and labor intensive to be financially worthwhile. In the case of Tapis III, Itter’s meticulous notes recorded 550 hours of weaving time and 675 hours of dye work.",
