  "text": "Threatening yet beautiful, ceremonial weaponry was used in rituals to combat obstacles to enlightenment. The crescent blade derives from Indian butchers’ knives used for skinning animals. An inscription invokes Mahakala Panjaranatha; the protective deity wields the weapon to slice through delusion and ignorance—separating illusion, or the “skin,” from ultimate reality. The handle takes the form of a vajra, the thunderbolt representing instant enlightenment. The “water knife,” a name derived from the wavelike blade and hilt, holds similar power. In a tour de force of metalwork, the fanciful handle of this water knife is composed of the head of a makara, a legendary sea creature, which holds the blade in its jaw.",
