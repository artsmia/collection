  "text": "The word settle refers to a type of furniture in the form of a long bench with arms and a tall, sometimes curved back that can extend well beyond the heads of those seated. The form most likely originated in the middle ages in association with monasteries. In later centuries, settles were used in both rustic interiors and grand halls providing a modicum of shelter from cold draughts or, when paired and set at right angles to the fire or hearth, to conserve heat. The form was resurrected by William Morris and his circle who looked to medieval and handcrafted models for their pure and morally elevating power, in contrast to the shoddy, mass produced wares that enslaved the common man in their production.",
