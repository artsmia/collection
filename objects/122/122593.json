  "text": "One of the most recognizable types of Korean ceramics is the rotund moon jar (dal-hang-ari). Named for its milk-white color and spherical form, the moon jar embodies the Korean aesthetic of simple elegance. They are created by throwing two bowl-like shapes on a potter’s wheel and joining them together (the join is visible along the equator). This method also results in variations; some jars are round, and others, like the example here, are more oval. The color, too, can vary depending on the firing conditions. These jars were practical and formal, used to store dry goods in daily life and as ritual vessels for ceremonies.",
