  "text": "Stylish kimono are draped casually over a deluxe pair of black lacquer stands, both adorned with gold <i>makie</i> designs and fittings. A red and gold amulet case hangs from the central case, while a <i>koto</i> (a musical instrument) rests on the floor. Such items represent the accoutrements of a fashionable prostitute, the kind who often appear in ukiyo-e paintings and prints. In her absence, we are asked to conjure up her beautiful visage ourselves. In the modern period such provocative paintings of women’s garments on display came to be called <i>Tagasode</i>, or “Whose Sleeves?”—a classical poetic device whereby the perfume arising from the sweep of a kimono’s sleeves evokes the image of its owner.",
