  "text": "This embroidered silk textile is an example of a decorative panel, called a <i>husu</i>, that would have decorated the back of an official’s courtly or ceremonial garb. The motif and materials of <i>husu</i> were differentiated based on the official’s position and rank. This late Joseon example featuring four pairs of facing cranes, in blue, yellow, and white, would have been reserved for a civil official. <i>Husu</i> were used from the end of the Goryeo period through the Joseon period.",
