  "text": "This embroidered silk textile is an example of a decorative panel, called a husu, that would have decorated the back of an official’s courtly or ceremonial garb. The motif and materials of husu were differentiated based on the official’s position and rank. This late Joseon example featuring four pairs of facing cranes, in blue, yellow, and white, would have been reserved for a civil official. Husu were used from the end of the Goryeo period through the Joseon period.",
