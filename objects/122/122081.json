  "text": "This handscroll illustrates the story of a beautiful woman who is married to a monkey against her will. One day, the story goes, an old farmer exhausted by his labors rashly promises the hand of his daughter to anyone willing to do his work in the fields. A monkey appears, accepts the offer, and, after doing the work, says he will come the next day to fetch his bride. The parents attempt to hide the girl by burying her in a box in the ground, but the monkey and his followers find her and take her to their mountain home. Before leaving to hunt for fruit, the monkeys put the woman in a large woven basket and hang it from a tree. Meanwhile, her distraught parents have enlisted the aid of hunters, who shoot down the basket and rescue the daughter. In her place, they leave some fierce dogs, which attack the monkey and his crew, killing all of them save one. The girl marries the chief hunter and everyone—except for the monkeys—lives happily ever after.",
