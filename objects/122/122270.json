When it comes to flowers and birds with patterned plumage, my awkwardness becomes even worse. A Chance reading of 'Shōzan gafu' by Sū Ikkei made me eager to try my hand. I rushed to gather some rosy pigments and painted a variety of flowers and cut branches. It is deplorable that my brush has turned rusty and the painting appears extremely crude. Compared with professional dyers and paint-workers, however, I may boast certain merits.)",
