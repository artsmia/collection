  "text": "Music is an integral part of a Noh performance. Called hayashi, it is composed for a group of four instruments: kotsuzumi (shoulder drum), ōtsuzumi (hip drum), taiko (stick drum), and fue (horizontal flute). A fue (flute) is made of multiple strips of smoked and lacquered bamboo wrapped in birch, and the interior is coated in lacquer; a small bamboo insert restricts the airflow to create distinct sounds. It is the only melodic instrument of the four.\r\nThe instruments and the cases that protect them are of very complex construction and require enormous skill to create. While the two flutes appear unassuming the cases, in contrast, are lavishly decorated. Butterflies flutter around the outer box, and gold and silver clouds waft across the inner case, tailormade for the two flutes. The fine craftsmanship and expensive materials of the two containers show that the owner cherished these instruments.",
