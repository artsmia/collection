  "text": "Drum-shaped sake casks (taikodaru) were produced in Japan as early as the Kamakura period (1185–1333), originally as ceremonial objects during religious events. Later, they were also used in secular events like weddings and cherry-blossom-viewing parties. These two black-lacquer casks feature drum-shaped bodies on ornamental stands, with small spouts on top for pouring sake. The face of each “drum” is decorated with designs of flowers and grasses executed in red lacquer.",
