Reading the passages of classical Japanese written in elegant calligraphy, or identifying a specific scene from the Tale and recalling the characters and dramas involved, could provide hours of fun for the screens’ owners and guests. But the screens could just as easily serve simply as a luxurious gold-and-silver backdrop for a gathering",
