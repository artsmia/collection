  "text": "The Tale of Usugumo follows a young nobleman from the northern province of Mutsu who paid frequent visits to the courtesan Usugumo in the New Yoshiwara pleasure quarter. The tale was not disseminated broadly; this handscroll is the only known extant copy. According to the postscript, the scroll once included a note and signature by the courtesan Usugumo herself, hinting at a close connection between her and the scroll owner of the scroll.\r\nThis handscroll has led a life of its own, encapsulated in its current appearance. The work was significantly damaged in a fire, which resulted in the loss of about one third of the tale’s text and illustrations. The burnt scroll was remounted on a handscroll and decorated with gold flecks.",
