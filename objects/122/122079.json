  "text": "Before the Edo period (1603–1868), poetry writing was largely\r\nan elite activity. The extended period of peace during this era allowed non-elites like the merchant and farmer class to enjoy leisure activities, which often trickled down from\r\nthe aristocracy. Because of their courtly origins, many of the respected classical poems were by aristocrats from the past, such as Minamoto Shunrai (1055–1129), also known\r\nas Toshiyori. His verses circulated in the form of printed poetry anthologies.  Similar to the poet portraits in One Hundred Poets, Shunrai sits alone in an empty space, accompanied by his poems above. The painter imagined him as an old wrinkled man contemplating his next composition, in contrast to the idealized portraits in One Hundred Poets. The top of this painting features two shikishi poetry cards in pink and white, adorned with a dusting of gold. His poem reads:\r\nMany currents branch out from\r\na tumbling cascade of a waterfall.\r\nRocks stand in the midst of waves\r\nformed by rapid flows,\r\nwhich become an eternal river.",
