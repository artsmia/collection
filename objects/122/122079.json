  "text": "An aristocrat and famous poet, Minamoto Shunrai (1055–1129), also known as Minamoto Toshiyori, lived during Japan’s classical Heian period (794–1185). He is known for composing innovative verses and for compiling the imperial poetry anthology Kin’yō wakashū (Collection of Golden Leaves) in the 1120s, at the behest of Emperor Shirakawa. In this small portrait Shunrai wears the clothes of a classical male courtier. One of his poems is brushed in flowing calligraphy on a poem card (shikishi) affixed to the upper left corner. Many currents branch out from a tumbling cascade of a waterfall. Rocks stand in the midst of waves formed by rapid flows, which become an eternal river.",
