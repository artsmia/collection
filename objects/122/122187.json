  "text": "A high-ranking prostitute in full regalia—elaborate hair ornaments, layers of kimono, and wide sash—is walking under a cherry tree together with her two youthful attendants, miniature replicas of herself. The use of color is highly restricted to shades of pink and gold on her hair ornaments, barely noticeable pink on her lips, bright red on the hem of her undergarment, and some red touches in the cherry blossoms. Thus creating an aura of subtle elegance and refinement surrounding this ethereal beauty.\r\n\r\nEishi was born into a high-ranking samurai family, himself serving the shogun from age 16 until 33 after which time he devoted himself to painting, first studying the academic Kano tradition, then specializing in paintings and woodblock prints in the ukiyo-e style.",
