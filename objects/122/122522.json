  "text": "Two consistencies of powdered green tea may be drunk at a tea gathering—a thin, frothy variety called usu-cha and an extremely rich type called koi-cha. Stronger, thicker koi-cha calls for a formal type of preparation requiring the use of ceramic caddies (called chaire) for holding the powdered tea, while the preparation of thinner usu-cha is less formal and features lacquer caddies (natsume) like this sleek black example by the world-renowned lacquer artist Suzuki Mutsumi.",
