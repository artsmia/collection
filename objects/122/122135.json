  "text": "This handscroll introduces inhabitants of various foreign lands, some real or semi-legendary and others fantastic, with each represented by a figure and textual description. Of those visible here, the far right figure hails from “Mokukya” (Morocco) and the next figure from “Chōren” (Chola, or southern India). The text describes how “Chōren” is home to some 60,000 elephants, upon whose backs the people build their homes. Next is a person from the land of “Jūri,” whose inhabitants face backward and have only one arm and one leg. At far left is an inhabitant of a land not far from Jūri called “Ichimoku,” or, literally, “One Eye Land.” Many of the descriptions are based on Chinese encyclopedias introduced to Japan in the seventeenth century.",
