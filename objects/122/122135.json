  "text": "Despite the controlled flow of trade and information from abroad, the Japanese were fascinated by the world beyond. Books from China provided a glimpse into the real and legendary realms across the ocean. The lands described in this handscroll are based on a mix of encyclopediasfrom China and Japan. Each land has a special characteristic: in one, inhabitants have a single eye; in another, people lack stomachs; and in yet another, they have long ears that they need to hold. Partially rooted in reality, with places listed like Samarkand, Morocco, and Chola, these encyclopedias also featured lands of fantastical beings.",
