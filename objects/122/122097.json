  "text": "Which is better, fall or spring' A gift of colorful maple leaves, accompanied by a poem describing the beauty of autumn, commences a debate among courtiers in the ancient Japanese novel Tale of Genji. The instigator is the empress Akikonomu. Her name literally means “loves autumn,” and it is she who appears on this silk fan, wearing the luxurious, layered robes of a court lady. In front of her, maple leaves from her garden fill the upturned lid of a lacquered box. This theme of autumnal beauty carries over to the back of the fan in the form of bush clover, a grass associated with the months before the onset of winter.",
