  "text": "Now in the format of a hanging scroll, this painting’s shape and vertical creases reveal that it was once a painted folding fan. Scenes from the <I>Tale of Genji</I> began to appear on folding fans as early as the mid-1600s. Artists typically referred to painting manuals and commentaries on the <I>Tale of Genji </I> in order to choose a scene to represent an entire chapter. This painting depicts five young women dressed as butterflies dancing before an audience of men on the veranda of Genji’s residence at the time of a spring festival held in the gardens (chapter 24, “Butterflies”).",
