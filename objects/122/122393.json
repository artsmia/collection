  "text": "Sanage ware resembles Chinese ceramics, having emerged in the 700s as an affordable substitute for expensive imported Chinese ceramics and the Japanese luxury wares they inspired. Known as the earliest glazed stoneware in Japan, Sanage ware was primarily made in central Honshū, the largest and most populous island of Japan, and remained popular until the 1100s, when it was superseded by another type of glazed stoneware produced in the region, now known as “Seto ware.”",
