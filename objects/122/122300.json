  "text": "Contemporary guide to tea ceremony, Enshū school.\r\n\r\nIn the mid-1600s, an aristocrat named Kobori Enshū (1579–1647), who was also a skilled poet, artist, flower arranger, and tea master, developed his own style of the tea ceremony based on the aesthetic ideal of <I>kirei-sabi</I>, which combined the notions of refined beauty (<I>kirei</I>) and patina, the wear associated with age (<I>sabi</I>). Enshū’s <I>kirei-sabi</I>  style, which partially supplanted <I>wabi<I> (imperfect or rustic) as the dominant aesthetic, had a great impact on the design of gardens and teahouses, decoration of teahouse interiors, and the production of tea wares in the mid-1600s. Two generations later, Endō Genkan, an adherent of the Enshū School of tea, wrote a number of important books on the Japanese tea ceremony including the volumes displayed here, which sought to disseminate Enshū’s <I>kirei-sabi</I> tea aesthetic.",
