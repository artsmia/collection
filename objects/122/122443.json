  "text": "Although this bottle for serving sake (Japanese rice liquor) was made at a time when Tanba potters were sometimes using artificial glazes to decorate their work, it features a more traditional Tanba style. The burst of natural ash glaze that drips from the mouth and shoulder makes a dramatic contrast to the reddish brown Tanba clay.",
