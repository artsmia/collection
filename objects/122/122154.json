  "text": "Suzuki Kiitsu was the best-known follower of Sakai Hōitsu. He carries on the Rinpa tradition here with a colorful summertime combination of white lilies and crimson camellias. Much of the linework used on the flowers leaves is executed in gold paint. The leaves also feature the trademark Rinpa painting technique known as tarashikomi, whereby additional pigments are applied atop other still-wet pigment and are allowed to bleed.",
