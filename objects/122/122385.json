  "text": "Bodhidharma was the Indian monk credited with transmitting Zen Buddhism to China in the 400s or 500s. He is thus worshipped widely as the patriarch of Zen. \r\n Originally, this figure would have been shown wearing a bright red robe, while the exposed parts of his body were covered in gold leaf. If you look closely you can make out the various layers of hemp cloth, lacquer, pigments, and gold leaf that once totally covered the surface of the carved wooden core. Over years of exposure in its original temple setting, the outer layers of gold and pigments have degraded, exposing the lacquer and hemp cloth below.",
