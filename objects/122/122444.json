  "text": "Kaya tree oil was used both in Buddhist ritual and for cooking. It comes from the seeds of the <I>kaya</I> tree (Torreya nucifera), which is native to southern Japan and parts of the Korean peninsula. The oil was often stored in short, wide-mouth jars like this one. Older oil jars are occasionally repurposed as rustic utensils for the tea ceremony.",
