  "text": "Kaya tree oil was used both in Buddhist ritual and for cooking. It comes from the seeds of the kaya tree (Torreya nucifera), which is native to southern Japan and parts of the Korean peninsula. The oil was often stored in short, wide-mouth jars like this one. Older oil jars are occasionally repurposed as rustic utensils for the tea ceremony.",
