  "text": "Shen Quan, also known as Shen Nanpin, moved from his native China to Nagasaki in far western Japan in 1731. Although he only stayed for a couple of years in Nagasaki, he gained many followers to whom he taught traditional Chinese painting methods. He focused on the realistic depiction of birds and flowers. Shen’s Japanese followers came to be known as the Nagasaki school, which included Kumashiro Yūhi, whose painting of magpies is displayed nearby. Shen created this painting of cats playing near bamboo and chrysanthemums while he was in residence in Nagasaki. Both cats and chrysanthemums can symbolize longevity. \r\n \r\n",
