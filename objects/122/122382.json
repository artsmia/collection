  "text": "Shinto deities most commonly appear in the form of Japanese courtiers. The attire of this god and goddess, however, reflects an unusual blend of foreign and native dress. Rather than wearing the garb of a man of the court, the male deity with his exposed chest and elaborate crown appears more like a Buddhist bodhisattva. The female deity wears a robe with pleated sleeves and frilled collar, which reflects Chinese dress of the Song dynasty (960–1279) instead of the voluminous, multilayered robes of a Japanese court lady. Carved from single blocks of wood, each deity sits before separate wooden plaques with painted decorations.\r\n\r\nSee Shinto Goddess [2015.79.265.2a,b]",
