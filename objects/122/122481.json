  "text": "The background of this box is known as “pear-skin ground” (<I>nashiji</I>), because the loose sprinkling of gold dust over the surface resembles the skin of an Asian pear (<I>nashi</I>). The body of the peacock was also created by applying gold dust to the lacquered surface of the box, a technique called <I>maki-e</I> (sprinkled pictures), while the bird’s tail feathers are adorned with tiny pieces of iridescent mother-of-pearl embedded into the surface. The delicacy of this box’s design is characteristic of lacquerware created in Japan in the 1500s.",
