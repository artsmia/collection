  "text": "Seitaka Dōji was one of two youthful attendants of the Buddhist deity Fudō Myō-ō, the immovable king of brightness, ” protector of the Buddhist faith, destroyer of ignorance, and guardian against demons. Often, when images of the deity and his two attendants are grouped together, Seitaka Dōji is portrayed as coarse and fierce—as he is here—in contrast to the more placid appearance of his fellow attendant, Kongara Dōji.",
