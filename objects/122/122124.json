  "text": "These scrolls show a pair of fabled Chinese Zen monks. The donkey-riding monk at right, Yushanzhu (whose name means Master of Mount Yu), was said to have achieved enlightenment as he fell while riding his donkey across a bridge. Zheng Huangniu (Zheng of the Yellow Ox) reads Buddhist scripture while riding his ox backwards—an indication of his detachment from the workaday world. This pairing of otherwise unrelated Chinese monks can be traced back to a beloved Chinese painting from the early 1200s that in the 1600s was owned by Japan’s ruling family, the Tokugawa, for whom Kano Dōun served as a painter-in-attendance for most of his career.",
