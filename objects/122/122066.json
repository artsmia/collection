  "text": "The fierce Buddhist deity known as Aizen Myōō is one of four Wisdom Kings who guard the four cardinal directions (north, south, west, east) around a central king known as the Immovable One (Fudō Myōō). Aizen is believed to have the ability to transform sexual passion into sacred love and desire for enlightenment. Backed by a fiery halo, wearing a lion-mask helmet, red-skinned, triple-eyed, and bearing an assortment of weapons and ritual objects in his six arms, Aizen is indeed fearsome. He sits on a lotus pedestal within a red orb that floats above a golden urn overflowing with multicolored wish-granting jewels. More jewels, scattered on the ground, symbolize this deity’s generosity in bestowing treasures on those who worship him.",
