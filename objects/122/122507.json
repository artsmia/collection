  "text": "The elegant shape of Negoro-ware sake (rice wine) vessels (<i>heishi<i>) are similar to shapes seen in ceramic wine vessels from China that were imported to medieval Japan in abundance. This <i>heishi<i> from the 1400s features a narrow spout, exaggerated shoulders, gracefully narrowing waist, and slightly wider base. Most <i>heishi<i> were produced as pairs for the ritual offering of sake. Years of use have worn away areas of the red lacquer that once covered the entire surface of this vessel to reveal a layer of black lacquer beneath.",
