  "text": "Inrō, sometimes called “medicine cases,” were used to carry a variety of small articles, not just medicine. The owner would typically hang an inrō over a sash worn at the waist. The inrō was connected by a cord to a counterweight, called a netsuke, which kept it from falling off. This lacquer inrō was produced by Hara Yōyūsai who decorated it with a motif of cranes and waves designed by the Rinpa painter, Sakai Hōitsu.",
