  "text": "The luminous figure of Amida, the Buddha of Boundless Light, descends on a cloud along with two attendant bodhisattvas, Seishi at left and Kannon at right. In what is known as a <I>raigō</I>, or “welcoming descent, ” the salvific trio has descended from Amida’s paradise in the Western Pure Land to this world in order to rescue a deceased believer. The devotee will be transported to the Pure Land upon the small lotus pedestal that Kannon holds in his hands. Paintings such as this played an important role in deathbed rituals.",
