  "text": "The scene shown here is from chapter 35, “New Herbs, Part II.” Genji accompanies several women on a pilgrimage: his lover Lady Murasaki; his former lover Lady Akashi and her mother; and the Akashi princess, Genji and Lady Akashi’s daughter. The women remain inside while at far right two men are seated on a veranda. Each woman is identified by name. Although it is now mounted as a hanging scroll, this painting is actually one fragment of a set of handscrolls showing scenes from the Tale of Genji. Painted only in black ink with ruler-drawn lines and an abundance of unmarked white paper, this and the several other remaining fragments of this set exemplify the hakubyō, or “white drawing,” style of painting. Hakubyō-style handscrolls of the Tale of Genji were very popular in medieval Japan.",
