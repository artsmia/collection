  "text": "This is an example of a shūbutsu, or an embroidered Buddhist image. Three large Sanskrit seed syllables, appearing encircled under a golden canopy, represent the Amida triad: Amitābha (Jp. Amida) Buddha in the center; and the bodhisatvas Mahāsthāmaprāpta (Jp. Daiseishi bosatsu) and Avalokiteśvara (Jp. Kannon) on the left and right, respectively. The cartouches at the top right and left corners read:\r\n(Right) The light of Amida illuminates the entire world\r\n(Left) All who praise Amida will attain salvation.\r\nA monk or a devotee stitched the seed syllables—the most sacred parts of the image—with their own hair as a way to accumulate merit. This act, of embroidering one’s hair into a Buddhist image, was not uncommon, especially among women. Hair was considered a precious offering because it symbolized a corporeal sacrifice. \r\n",
