  "text": "Ibaraki-dōji was a demon who became a follower of Shuten-dōji, the leader of a gang of demons terrorizing Kyoto in the 10th century. Ibaraki was able to escape when the other demons were destroyed and he went on to Rashōmon gate. There, he encountered the warrior Watanabe no Tsuna who cut one of his arms off. Appearing as an old woman, Ibaraki is granted access to see the arm that is kept in a purified box. He manages to steal his arm and, reverting back into a demon, disappears into the sky.\r\n\r\nShibata Zeshin was all and foremost a lacquer artist but created also striking paintings and the Ibaraki demon was one of his favorite subjects. Several versions in screen and scroll format exist as well as wood plaques dedicated to specific shrines and temples.",
