  "text": "These hand-painted seashells are parts of the popular game known as <I>kai-awase</I>, or the “shell-matching game.” Pairs of shells are decorated on their insides with the same scene from the <I>Tale of Genji</I> As in Memory and other matching games, the point was to try to match shells with similar scenes. Players could enjoy the fun of the game itself, and were also entertained by the images that reminded them of the <I>Tale’</I>s twists and turns or of a famous poem recited by one of the characters.",
