  "text": "Kodaiji style lacquer\r\n\r\nWriting boxes such as this, called <i>suzuribako</i> in Japanese, were used to hold an assortment of writing utensils, including an inkstone, a water dropper, brushes, and sticks of ink. On each side of the bold zigzag is a combination of auspicious floral motifs in <i>maki-e</i>, or “sprinkled picture,” a technique in which artists apply metallic flakes or powder on the lacquer surface before it fully dries. On the upper left we see pine trees and plum blossoms on a black lacquer background, and on the lower right chrysanthemums and paulownia decorate a red background created with the <i>nashiji </i> (“pear skin”) technique. The zigzag is a unique design feature of lacquer objects created in the so-called Kōdaiji style, which developed in the late 1500s and was associated with the temple Kōdaiji in Kyoto.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
