  "text": "This short, bulbous jar, probably used to store liquids, features several levels of decorations between the neck and shoulders, around the body, and around the base. These designs were carved into the clay when it was leather hard, but before firing. Although the rim is almost entirely missing, the remaining section reveals the protruding ornamentation that once covered it.",
