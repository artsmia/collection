  "text": "A pair of red-crested cranes settle on the shore of a lake. Beneath a twisted old pine tree, one stands upright and sounds a call while his partner bends low, perhaps having discovered a tasty insect among the rocks and low-lying sasayabu (bamboo grass). From ancient times, cranes in Japan were said to live for a thousand years, serving as potent symbols of youthfulness and long life in both literature and art. Pine trees also signify longevity. This screen would have functioned as the left half of a pair of six-panel folding screens, though its companion is now lost.",
