At the back are three figures: Sanbo, Sanmyo, and San'in, all stepping on clouds. In front of the horse is a worshipping disciple. / Eulogy: Memyo Bosatsu, incarnating himself in the cosmos, / turns into a silkworm that spits out silk flosses. / Flying around the world, it is heralded by a suffusion of music, / responsive to people's offerings, it brings them boundless good fortune.]; [Sanmyo, San'in, Sanbo, Sanshitsu]; [Worshipping disciple making an offering]",
