  "text": "Fallen cherry blossoms, rendered in gold and silver, adorn the outside surface of the lid of this black lacquered writing box. A writing box contains the tools necessary for the brush arts of calligraphy and ink painting, including an inkstone and water dropper. The underside of the lid and the interior of the box feature a group of Portuguese men, with their distinctive pantaloons and hats. The dark-skinned individuals may be African or Indian. The figural group appears on a black lacquer and silver foil checkered background inspired by European designs. After nearly four hundred years of use and display, some of the inlaid silver squares have fallen off.",
