  "text": "The scene on this folding fan is from “Channel Buoys,” the fourteenth chapter of the Tale of Genji. Genji makes a pilgrimage to Sumiyoshi Shrine—located near the coast in what is now Osaka—to thank the gods after the end of a period of exile. Here, Genji and his entourage have parked their elegant carriages near Sumiyoshi’s pine-lined beach. Look for the red torii gate, marking the entrance to the shrine’s sacred precincts, in the upper right. This painting is probably the work of an artist affiliated with the Tosa school of court painters, which specialized in the type of miniaturist style seen here, with fine lines, heavily applied mineral pigments, and gold leaf and paint.",
