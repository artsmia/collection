  "text": "The scene on this folding fan is from chapter 14 of The Tale of Genji. Genji makes a pilgrimage to Sumiyoshi Shrine to thank the gods after the end of a period of exile. Genji and his entourage have parked their elegant carriages near Sumiyoshi’s pine-lined beach. Illustrations of this scene, including several in this exhibition, often show a single boat floating off the coast, signaling the simultaneous arrival of Genji’s former lover, the Akashi Lady. The magnificence of Genji’s entourage makes the Akashi Lady painfully aware of her own lower social status, so she retreats without ever announcing her presence. When Genji learns she is nearby, they exchange a series of poems. \r\n\tThe vertical lines visible on this painting are from creases made by bamboo slats when the painting was earlier mounted as a folding fan. A later owner removed the painting from the bamboo structure and converted it to its present scroll format, thus assuring its preservation.",
