  "text": "This calendar consists of six plaques, each painted on both sides, featuring an animal from the Chinese zodiac calendar. The holder mimics the format and mount of a hanging scroll and even includes ivory rollers. Some of the paintings are accompanied by inscriptions that indicate in which style Zeshin painted. The dragon plaque, for example, is in the style of Kano Tan'yū (1602–74) and the dog plaque was inspired by Maruyama Ōkyo's (1733–95) famous puppies.\r\n\r\nZeshin is considered the world's greatest lacquer artist who also developed a number of new techniques. His principle technique is takamaki-e, or raised sprinkled design, where the pictorial elements are raised above the surface, sprinkled with gold or silver, and then protected with a coat of clear lacquer.",
