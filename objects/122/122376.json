  "text": "Vaiśravaṇa, or Bishamonten in Japanese, is one of the Twelve Devas, a group of Hindu gods adopted as Buddhist guardian deities charged with protecting the four cardinal directions, the four intermediate directions, and the sun, moon, heaven, and earth. As the most powerful of the 12, Vaiśravaṇa presides over the north, which was considered the most dangerous direction as it was inhabited by evil demons and ogres. Appearing here in full armor, he stands atop two such fiends who have been defeated by his might. Sculptures of Vaiśravaṇa and other guardian deities are often placed around the principal icons of worship in Buddhist temples.",
