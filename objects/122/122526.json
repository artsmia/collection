  "text": "Aizen Myōō, is one of the Wisdom Kings, fierce spirits associated with esoteric Buddhism. Although his name means “Wisdom King, Imbued with Love,” a reflection of the love he holds for the Buddha and the love he is shown in return, Aizen Myōō is actually a manifestation of the wrathful aspect of Dainichi, the cosmic Buddha. As such, he has multiple heads and arms and carries a bow and arrow. In this bronze mirror, originally used in esoteric Buddhist ritual, he appears alongside auspicious cranes and turtles.",
