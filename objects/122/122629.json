  "text": "Hats like this one, called gat, were an essential part of a man’s attire in Joseon dynasty Korea (1392–1897). A gat was made of horsehair and silk, built on a bamboo frame, and then lacquered. A man would place the gat over an inner hat called a tanggeon and tie it under the chin with long ribbons. In Korea, Confucianist thought dominated learning and formed the basis of moral and cultural standards. To demonstrate their respectability, men of the ruling yangban class wore gat at all times, even at home.",
