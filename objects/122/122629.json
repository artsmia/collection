  "text": "Hats like this one, called gat in Korean, are made of horsetail hair and silk on a bamboo frame. In the 1800s they were only worn by married, middle-class men. Gat rode atop the head (rather than low on the brow like Western hats), were worn over an inner hat called a tanggeon, and were tied under the chin with black cords that might fall as low as the man’s lower torso.",
