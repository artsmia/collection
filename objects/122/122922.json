  "text": "The curvaceous “Kremlin Bells” three-part decanter is one of Kaj Franck’s spirited designs for art glass. It was part of the Finnish firm Nuutajärvi’s hand-blown art glass production from around 1958 to 1968. Over this time, colors changed, and as a result no two hand-blown examples are identical. This one has a unique mosaic glass stopper.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis set also highlights one of Franck’s core principles: stackability. The middle component functions as a separate decanter, so the three-part object can contain two separate liquids. Besides saving space, it also has no handle, following Franck’s principle of material conservation and reduced costs.\r\n",
