  "text": "Hyungbae, or rank badges, were sewn onto the chest and back of a danryeong (round-collared) robe. The patterns on the badge signified a specific rank and often featured auspicious symbols. In this pair, two cranes bite a single lingzhi fungus (bullocho in Korean). They are surrounded by colorful stylized clouds above and stylized rocks and waves below. Starting in 1871, the double-crane motif was reserved for the highest rank of civil official (as opposed to military officials, who had tigers as insignia). The Joseon court adopted the rank badge system from China in 1454 and kept it in use until 1899.",
