  "text": "A lady with long, open black hair in classical court attire from the 11th century is standing under a cherry tree, with her sleeve raised to her mouth. These visual elements suggest that she is Ise no Tayū, a famous poet who is one of the late classical Thirty-Six Immortal Poets.\r\n\r\nMiyagawa Chōshun was an ukiyo-e artist who specialized in painting rather than woodblock prints. Chōshun was renowned for his delicate style and ability to depict figures that seem to interact in a natural and convincing manner.",
