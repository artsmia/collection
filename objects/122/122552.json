  "text": "An incredible variety of birds—ducks, pheasants, parrots, and others—pose and cavort among an equally diverse array of flowers, including lilies, peonies, chrysanthemums, and white and pink plum blossoms. Specific combinations of birds and flowers are almost always symbolic and auspicious. The ducks paired with camellias in the fourth panel from the right, for example, are emblematic of an enduring marriage.",
