  "text": "Kanzan (Chinese: Hanshan) and Jittoku (Ch.: Shide), a pair of ninth-century Chinese monk-poets, almost always appear together in Japanese painting. In this composition—based on a work by thirteenth-century Chinese painter Muqi Fachang that later became a stock image for Japanese painters affiliated with the Kano House—Jittoku is depicted at right grinding ink for his friend Kanzan, who uses the prepared ink to brush a poem on the wall of a cave at left.\r\n\r\nAlthough now mounted on a hanging scroll, this painting was once used as an elegant folding fan. The vertical creases apparent across the paper surface were created by the fan’s wooden ribs.",
