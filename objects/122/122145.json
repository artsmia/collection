  "text": "In addition to Chinese characters, the Japanese writing system uses two forms of syllabaries (characters that represent a syllable): hiragana and katakana. The two written syllabaries developed from Chinese characters used to phonetically represent Japanese.  Prior to the 1100s, each script style was associated with certain types of writing; for example, Chinese writing was used for scholarly texts, with annotations in katakana; novels and Japanese poetry employed hiragana and Chinese characters.\r\n\r\nThis poem is written with a mix of kanji (Chinese characters) and variants of hiragana called hentaigana. The larger, thicker characters—mostly kanji—provide visual accents to the poem. Taken from the Collection of Japanese Poems of Ancient and Modern Times (Kokin wakashū), the poem reads: “The autumn moon shines brilliantly / upon the mountains / illuminating every / fallen colored leaf.”",
