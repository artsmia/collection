  "text": "In this portrait of Fujiwara Teika (1162–1241), the celebrated poet is dressed in the formal garb of a courtier. Now mounted as a hanging scroll, this painting was once part of a long handscroll called One Poet One Poem (Ikkasen isshu), which featured portraits of revered poets alongside a single example of their poetry. The poem at right reads:\r\nHitori nuru \r\nyamadori no o no\r\nshidario ni\r\nshimo iki mayou\r\ntoko no tsukikage\r\nFrost has formed \r\non the trailing tail\r\nof a solitary sleeping pheasant, its bed illuminated by a cold autumn moon.\r\n[Translated by Miyeko Murase]",
