  "text": "Yakushi, whose name means “medicine teacher,” is the golden buddha at the center of this painting. Just below him are his attendants, the bodhisattvas of the moon and sun. According to Buddhist scripture, Yakushi himself was once a bodhisattva (a divine being who postpones becoming a buddha and helps living beings achieve enlightenment). He then made twelve vows to heal the sick and ignorant and guide them on the path to enlightenment. Yakushi’s great vows manifested as twelve divine generals, shown here as figures wearing armor and carrying weapons, six on either side of the central group. Having made his vows and become a buddha, Yakushi with his retinue rules over a paradise said to be in the East, as opposed to the Western Paradise of the buddha Amida.",
