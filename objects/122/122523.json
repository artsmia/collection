  "text": "According to Japanese Buddhist belief, the year 1052 marked the beginning of a degenerative era known as <I>mappō</I>, the Latter Days of the Buddhist Law. During these so-called Latter Days, the practice of the Buddhist Law (or “dharma”) would die out, preventing anyone from gaining enlightenment and escaping the cycle of death and rebirth. The arrival of Miroku, the buddha of the future, at the end of ten thousand years would return the dharma to legitimacy. In response, Japanese Buddhists set out to preserve the dharma through the zealous copying of Buddhist scriptures (sutras), which were enclosed in sutra containers and buried in sutra burial mounds (<I>kyōzuka</I>).",
