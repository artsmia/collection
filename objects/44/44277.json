  "text": "Louise Nevelson is internationally renowned for her monumental installations and monochromatic wood assemblages of found objects painted in black or white. In addition to these now-iconic modernist sculptures, Nevelson also produced editioned prints and multiples throughout her career. Many, such as this elegant lead relief, explored the articulation and interplay of light and shadow in space that lies at the heart of Nevelson's expression. On this she observed, \"I really deal with shadow and space...I identify with the shadow.\" She also thought that her personal vision as an artist emanated from her ability to see in the fourth dimension.",
