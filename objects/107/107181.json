  "text": "Onorato Carlandi was one of the founding members of the Society of Roman Watercolorists, established in 1875. He worked almost exclusively in landscape, depicting stunning views of Rome, his hometown, and even more often, its scenic surroundings. In this remarkably fresh watercolor, Carlandi skillfully reserves specks of the bare white paper to mimic the flickering light that dapples budding branches in springtime.",
