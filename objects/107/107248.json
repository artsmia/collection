  "text": "This drawing was recently conserved; the treatment was funded by a generous grant from the McCrindle Foundation. Small wholes were repaired where the heavily applied ink had eaten through the paper, seen, for example, in the handle of the sword St. Catherine holds, as well as the corner of her book. The study was executed in iron gall ink, a corrosive medium favored by Italian draftsmen in the 17th century, which is made from mixing iron sulphate with crushed galls, the growths that form on oak trees around insect larvae.",
