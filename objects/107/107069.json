  "text": "Kara Walker began working in the 1990s in an obsolete artistic medium, the cut-paper silhouette, which she radically transformed into a potent language to explore a range of issues in American history and society, mainly related to slavery, violence, and sexual exploitation.\r\n\r\nIn this linoleum cut, Walker depicts the solitary nude figure of a female African American slave, caught in mid-air as she tumbles down. The image is at once elegant and disturbing, elegant in form and compositional harmony yet disturbing in its dark and foreboding content.",
