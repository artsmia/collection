  "text": "Following the iconoclasm of 1566, in which many of Antwerp’s religious images were destroyed, the thriving market for new works kept Maerten de Vos busy for the rest of the century. A Lutheran until 1583 or 1584, de Vos converted to Catholicism in order to remain in the city. This newly discovered drawing, his earliest by a decade, dates from his Protestant years. It is a design for his Life of Rebecca painting series. The story of Rebecca is told in Genesis. Abraham, wishing his son, Isaac, to marry, sent his servant Eliezer to Mesopotamia to find Isaac a wife. One evening Eliezer waited with his camels by a well. The beautiful Rebecca came to draw water, and when he asked for a drink, she offered water to his camels as well as to him. By this he knew that she was destined to be Isaac’s bride. The drawing shows Rebecca introducing her brother, Laban, to Eliezer.",
