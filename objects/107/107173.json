  "text": "The Wiener Werkstätte began producing and selling printed textiles under its own label in 1910, announcing in the Viennese daily newspaper <I>Neue Freie Presse</I> that their products were available exclusively at the Wertheim department store in Berlin.  Wiener Werkstätte pattern books from the early 1910s contain not only samples of the patterns, but also suggestions for their use in clothing and home furnishings.\r\n\r\nWhile Hoffmann's textile patterns can be considered geometric, they are less rigidly so than his works in other media during ths period, making them ideal for use in clothing and accessories.  Consumers used <I>Wasserfall</I>, or Waterfall, with its slightly curvilinear lines, for dresses and lampshades, among other items.",
