  "text": "Born in Cincinatti, Ohio, Henry Muhrman moved to Germany at the age of 22 to study at the Munich art academy. In 1883, he settled in London, where he likely executed this pastel before moving back to Germany in 1901. Muhrman brilliantly captures the luminous, ephemeral quality of the spring blossoms in this dark shadowy garden. He applies quick, short strokes of white and pink pastel, so that the light-catching powdery particles twinkle against the dark branches.",
