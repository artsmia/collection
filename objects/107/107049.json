  "text": "Edgar Degas devoted his artistic career to breaking boundaries. Winding River is simultaneously a landscape and an abstraction. It is a painting, a print, and a drawing. Colorful and poetic, it recalls Impressionism but was certainly not painted directly from nature.\r\n\r\nIn 1890, Degas embarked on a series of nearly fifty landscape monotypes—prints made by painting in dilute oils on a smooth copper plate and then transferring the image to a sheet of paper, using a printing press. Degas, it seems, could never leave an artwork alone. As with many of his monotypes, after printing this one he overworked the image (now reversed) with pastel crayons.\r\n\r\nRather than recording impressions of nature’s beauty outdoors, Degas worked indoors, relying on imagination and perhaps also memory. Winding River is loosely based on a Japanese color print made in 1856 by Utagawa Hiroshige, whose work Degas collected. That Degas worked on the image both before and after printing distances it from the immediacy of true Impressionism.",
