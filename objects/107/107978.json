  "text": "John De Andrea is an American sculptor and a contributor to the superrealist art movement; he was part of the original art movement that began in the late 1960s. He has become famous for his life-like sculptures of nude models, the majority of which are idealized figures of women. Cast from life and finished with the utmost detail, these sculptures are usually elegant and casually posed. Their glossy hyperrealism, however, ultimately detracts from their beauty - much as surgical enhancements mar the natural beauty of so many women today.  In this sense, especially, these works are a fascinating expression of contemporary culture.\r\n\r\n<I>Joan</I> is a quintessential example of DeAndrea's superrealist sculpture, in which he explores his interest in <I>trompe l'oei</I> and his ideas about female beauty.",
