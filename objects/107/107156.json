  "text": "Norbert Goeneutte (1854–1894) studied under Isadore Pils and Henri Lehmann, but soon became tired of formal training and moved to Montmartre. There he became friends with Auguste Renoir and Marcellin Desboutin who sparked Goeneutte’s lifelong interest in printmaking. Goeneutte first exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1876, and was an annual exhibitor there until his death from tuberculosis in 1894 at age 40. The graphic arts were a significant aspect of his career and his oeuvre includes some 150 etchings, drypoints and lithographs.",
