  "text": "Fashion magazines ceased from 1793 to 1797 as society reeled from the most violent years of the Revolution, when an estimated 17,000 state executions took place. Around 1800, ideals of Greco-Roman “democratic” dress became fully realized. Columnar white cotton gowns with short sleeves and raised “empire” waistlines (so called for Napoleon’s French empire) aligned with ancient silhouettes. In 1801, following Napoleon’s campaign in Egypt, he returned with imported Indian cashmere shawls for his wife,  Josephine. These luxurious accessories soon became requisite, not only for the warmth they provided but for evoking the draped mantles of ancient dress. Seen here, an elaborately curled “Coeffure Grecque,” or Greek hairstyle, completed the look.",
