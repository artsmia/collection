  "text": "Eugène Delâtre (1854–1938) played a fundamental role in the establishment of color etching at the end of the nineteenth century in France. He was trained by his father Auguste Delâtre, the premier printer of the Etching Renaissance. While Eugène began working in the black and white tradition, he created his first color plate in 1891 and In a Garden (1893) was the first color print he exhibited at the Salon. Similar to the color aquatints of American Mary Cassatt, In a Garden incorporates numerous artistic devices learned from Japanese prints, such as the emphasis on outline and silhouette and the choice of a pale color scheme. \"In a Garden\" was printed \"au repérage,\" or with one plate for each color.",
