  "text": "This scene of the Mississippi River, depicted from the vantage point of being on the river, shows people sailing, rowing and waiting to board more modern vessels. The crisp, carefully-observed quality of light captures the stark contrasts that occur as the sun re-emerges after a storm. The water is like a mirror and the whites of sails and painted ships appear to shine against the moody atmosphere lingering as the storm passes.",
