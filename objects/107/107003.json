  "text": "A river scene painted from the vantage point of being on the river. In the foreground on the river we see two people in a rowboat. near the horizon, just left of center there is a boat with full sail on the calm water. many other details are visible at the far shore in the deep distance. At right, in contrast to the boats that are moving by human and wind power, two steamboats wait in a harbor for passengers to board their double-decker structures.",
