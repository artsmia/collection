  "text": "This work featuring the loose, visible brushwork characteristic of Impressionism is rather unusual for its geometric style. The entire image is composed of simple shapes that together form a rural landscape. Theodore Robinson made this painting during time spent in the French town of Giverny (about 50 miles northwest of Paris), where he studied with the Impressionist master Claude Monet. The two artists became close friends.",
