  "text": "Mountain lake with sunlit shore hills, a protruding rock with a tree and bushes on the left, in the middle distance a small rowboat with two standing people. The sky is light blue. The lake has indirect sunlight, as the sun is only beginning to rise; the lower mountain rock beside the lake likewise remains in light shadow, rendered in light blue and gray. Much of the distant mountain, however, is illuminated by the morning light and appear pinkish gray in the distance.",
