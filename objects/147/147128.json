  "text": "Having studied in Amsterdam and Paris, Dutch painter Leo Gestel was interested in international avant-garde artistic movements. He delved into Divisionism, Fauvism, Cubism, and Expressionism. At times he dealt with major events, such as the displacement of refugees during World War I, but more often he depicted everyday life.\r\n\r\nHere Gestel presents us with a colorful autumn landscape. The harvest is complete. Haystacks stud the low, rolling landscape beneath a color, windswept sky.",
