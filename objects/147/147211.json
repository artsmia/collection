  "text": "Over eight feet across, this winter scene depicts a frozen river curving through a snowy landscape, rendered in bright white and cool gray tones. The viewer is standing on the riverbank and the surface of the river is punctuated with floes of ice and patches of needle ice, while the branches of nearby trees are dusted with fresh snow. Beyond the river, there is a forest of pine trees. At the horizon, a mountain glows in the warmth of golden light.",
