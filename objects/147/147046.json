  "text": "The German painter/graphic artist/designer Ludwig von Hofmann trained intensively, first under his uncle Johann Michael Heinrich Hofmann (1824-1911), who was a professor at the Kunstakademie, Dresden, then academies in Karlsruhe, Munich, and Paris, where he was particularly interested in the arcadian paintings of Puvis de Chavannes. in 1892, he co-founded the Group of Eleven, which led to the formation of the Berlin Secession in 1899. In 1903, he embarked on an academic career with his appointment as a professor at the Kunstakademie in Weimar. In 1916, he became a professor of mural art at the Kunstakademie Dresden, where he remained until 1931. He co-founded the Deutscher Künstlerbund (German Federation of Artists). In the 1930s, his production waned, and, in 1937, some of his works the Nazis declared some of his work “degenerate art.” He retired to Pillnitz, near Dresden, where he died in 1945.\r\n\r\nHe made these studies of a nude youth about 1894, when he was working Berlin. The sheet s shows two views of a nude youth lying on a blocky platform. The lower view shows the boy's hands clasped. to the upper left is an auxiliary view of his hands. Such drawings are typical of the careful preparation that academically trained artists gave devoted to their paintings.",
