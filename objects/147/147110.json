  "text": "In 1838, Scottish painter David Roberts toured the Near East, making him one of the first British artists to gain first-hand knowledge of the region. He went from Egypt to the Sinai and Petra, arriving in Jerusalem at Easter 1839. Remaining there for a few weeks, he then continued north to Lebanon and departed from Beirut in May. From the outset of his journey, Roberts planned to publish a great set of Near-Eastern views, which eventually appeared as \"The Holy Land, Idumea, Arabia, Egypt and Nubia.\" He worked with lithographer Louis Haghe (1806-1885) to develop a six-volume magnum opus, containing 247 hand-colored lithographs based on his on-the-spot drawings. To fund the project, he exhibited his original drawings in London and used the exhibition catalogue as a prospectus to recruit subscribers. Four hundred signed up, and the series was published in parts from 1842 to 1849.This was one of the 19th century's most elaborate topographical publications illustrated with hand-colored lithographs. It was also one of the last, for photography soon became the preferred medium for views of far off lands. Nonetheless, Roberts's and Haghe's prints remained central to understanding of Egypt and the Holy Land in Victorian Britain.\n\r\n\r\nLuxor was the ancient city of Thebes, the capital of Upper Egypt during the New Kingdom. Though other cities, such as Alexandria, later took on greater political importance, Thebes, as the city of the Amun-Ra, the chief god of the Egyptian pantheon, remained the religious center of Egypt until the Greek period. Roberts shows us a view of the city from the vantagepoint of an island in the Nile. In his journal he expressed disdain for the mud-brick structures later built among the ancient stone monuments, such as the huge temple at the center and the pylon gate to the right. The device in the foreground is a \"shadoof,\" a crane to hoist water from the Nile to irrigate the arable soil of the island. Roberts referred to the man reclining next to it as a \"fellah,\" an agricultural laborer, and noted the excessive labor required to operate the shadoof.",
