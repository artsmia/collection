  "text": "Jud Nelson has been described as \"part Pop prankster, part Renaissance master, with a good dose of Minimalist strategist thrown in.\" Illusion lies at the heart of Nelson's sculptural practice. Here, he portrays a folded men's dress shirt, one of several carved marble sculptures of men's shirts he completed in the 1990s. These and other trompe-l'oeil renderings are part of his ongoing series HOLOS, begun in 1971. In Greek, holos means “whole” or “total”; it’s the root of the word “hologram,” or perfect three-dimensional illusion. Nelson’s sculptures simultaneously embrace both ideal form and its artificially generated analogue.",
