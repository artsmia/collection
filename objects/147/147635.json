  "text": "Frank Walter was a self-taught artist with a keen intellect and thirst for knowledge, who created a body of work that encompasses a variety of mediums, subject matter, and styles. Walter painted from his heart, composing subjects drawn from his imagination and everyday life, such as this landscape scene with a stand of trees set against a brilliant reddish-pink \"hurricane\" sky. His paintings function as visions that evoke emotion and mystery, mirroring life itself.",
