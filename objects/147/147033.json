  "text": "Having studied in Amsterdam and Paris, Dutch painter Leo Gestel was interested in international avant-garde artistic movements. He delved into Divisionism, Fauvism, Cubism, and Expressionism. At times he dealt with major events, such as the displacement of refugees during World War I, but more often he depicted everyday life.\r\n\r\nWith an indiosyncartic technique that grows from Gestel's Divisionist and Fauvist experience, colorful smears, dashes, and snaking lines, resolve as  a cottage nestled in the woods along the bank of a body of water. A small boat is tied up at the bank. Despite the wildness of the technique, the scene takes on a peaceful mood. Soft reflections bring the color of the view into the water.",
