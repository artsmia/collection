  "text": "In 1838, Scottish painter David Roberts toured the Near East, making him one of the first British artists to gain first-hand knowledge of the region. He went from Egypt to the Sinai and Petra, arriving in Jerusalem at Easter 1839. Remaining there for a few weeks, he then continued north to Lebanon and departed from Beirut in May. From the outset of his journey, Roberts planned to publish a great set of Near-Eastern views, which eventually appeared as The Holy Land, Idumea, Arabia, Egypt and Nubia. He worked with lithographer Louis Haghe (1806-1885) to develop a six-volume magnum opus, containing 247 hand-colored lithographs based on his on-the-spot drawings. To fund the project, he exhibited his original drawings in London and used the exhibition catalogue as a prospectus to recruit subscribers. Four hundred signed up, and the series was published in parts from 1842 to 1849.This was one of the 19th century's most elaborate topographical publications illustrated with hand-colored lithographs. It was also one of the last, for photography soon became the preferred medium for views of far off lands. Nonetheless, Roberts's and Haghe's prints remained central to understanding of Egypt and the Holy Land in Victorian Britain.\n\r\n\r\nRoberts made many views of Petra, a city of the Arab Nabatean Kingdom and now an archeological site in southern Jordan, famous for its extensive complex of buildings hewn directly from sandstone cliffs. Usually, he focused on famous, readily identifiable sites. The ruinous structure appears to be the remains of a triple-arched monumental gateway that separated the Colonnaded Street (Petra's main street) from the temenos (sacred precinct) of Qasr al-Bint. The gate no longer looks so isolated. We do not yet know if that is due to Robert's taking artistic license to heighten the impact of the structure or to reconstruction post-dating Roberts's visit.",
