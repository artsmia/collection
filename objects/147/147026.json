  "text": "As scholar and curator Jami Powell notes, “During a 2017 residency at the Georgia O’Keeffe Museum  in Santa Fe, New Mexico, Michael Namingha found  himself drawn to the distinct, rounded, gray-and-black  terrain of the Bistahí Dééł Náázíní (Bisti/De-Na-Zin  Wilderness), which O’Keeffe called the “Black Place.” The area sits beneath the largest methane cloud in the United  States, which when viewed with infrared technology appears as a bright orange, red, and yellow dot over the  Four Corners region. After using a drone to capture the image of the fragile landscape, Namingha arranged the red from this satellite imagery alongside the fragmented and abstracted landscape. The result is a hauntingly beautiful interrogation of human intervention on the landscape.”",
