  "text": "Having studied in Amsterdam and Paris, Dutch painter Leo Gestel was interested in international avant-garde artistic movements. He delved into Divisionism, Fauvism, Cubism, and Expressionism. At times he dealt with major events, such as the displacement of refugees during World War I, but more often he depicted everyday life.\r\n\r\nHere Geestl takes us to the beach on a windy day. Gulls wheel in the cloudy sky as pennants fly from poles by small tents that beach goers have set up along the shore. Whitecaps waves roll in, and a few people are out playing in them. Most, however, stay on the sand. ",
