  "text": "Kojima’s sculptures draw inspiration from both natural landscapes and human-made objects, reflecting civilization's traces as they are inevitably reclaimed by nature. Kojima’s pieces celebrate the duality of ceramics, embodying both organic origins and human artifice. The interplay of crackling glaze, pooling glass, and rough-hewn clay creates objects that appear ancient, as if shaped by the earth itself.",
