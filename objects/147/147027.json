  "text": "The series “Japanese House” by Tomoko Yoneda aligns with the artist’s long-held interest in sites with layered histories. She brings us into buildings in Taiwan, built during the island’s Japanese occupation (1895–1945) that still retain the Japanese architectural style of the 1920s and 30s. Over time, however, their interiors have undergone significant changes. The home of a child of a former Japanese government official, for instance, becomes a gathering place for music-related posters. The past and the present poetically co-exist in Yoneda’s photograph, providing a glimpse of the lives of those who inhabited these spaces and how in their re-use, they take on new meanings.",
