  "text": "A landmark of German literature, typography, book illustration, and propaganda, Theuerdank is a fictionalized account of Habsburg Emperor Maximilian I and his epic journey to marry Mary of Burgundy, one of the richest, most powerful women in Europe. The story is told in verse and accompanied by 117 detailed woodcut illustrations.\r\n\r\nMaximilian had a remarkable understanding of the power of the printing press and commissioned several elaborate projects to polish his public image as a wise, wiley, and worthy ruler. Here he is cast as the knight Theuerdank (lofty thoughts), who faces every obstacle--avalanche, lightning, shipwrecks, plots, duels, battles, even the Devil himself--in his chivalrous quest.",
