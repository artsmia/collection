  "text": "\nThis is a close-up view of the so-called Treasury at Petra, a city of the Arab Nabatean Kingdom and now an archeological site in southern Jordan. Though Scottish painter David Roberts tought of the structure as a temple, it was conceived as an elaborate tomb cut directly from the sandstone face of the canyon in the 1st century CE. Roberts shows us the broken columns of the portico; today's visitors see them in a repaired state. Roberts seems to alter the scale of the figures to give a significant role to the foreground figures while using the figures under the portico to emphasize its huge size.\r\n\r\nIn 1838, Roberts toured the Near East, making him one of the first British artists to gain first-hand knowledge of the region. He went from Egypt to the Sinai and Petra, arriving in Jerusalem at Easter 1839. Remaining there for a few weeks, he then continued north to Lebanon and departed from Beirut in May. From the outset of his journey, Roberts planned to publish a great set of Near-Eastern views, which eventually appeared as \"The Holy Land, Idumea, Arabia, Egypt and Nubia.\" He worked with lithographer Louis Haghe (1806-1885) to develop a six-volume magnum opus, containing 247 hand-colored lithographs based on his on-the-spot drawings. To fund the project, he exhibited his original drawings in London and used the exhibition catalogue as a prospectus to recruit subscribers. Four hundred signed up, and the series was published in parts from 1842 to 1849.This was one of the 19th century's most elaborate topographical publications illustrated with hand-colored lithographs. It was also one of the last, for photography soon became the preferred medium for views of far off lands. Nonetheless, Roberts's and Haghe's prints remained central to understanding of Egypt and the Holy Land in Victorian Britain.",
