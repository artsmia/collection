  "text": "A clear blue river cuts through a rocky shoreline and flows towards the viewer in this horizontal format painting. Frothy white rapids form over the river’s rocky outcrops in the midground. A dense green forest lines the left bank. Low bluffs jut into the river on the right. Beyond, low mountains span the length of the picture. The mountains are rocky and full of green vegetation except for a patch near the center of the painting, where the hills meet the water, where there is a smooth expanse of cleared field. A small cluster of four houses rests in the middle of the field.",
