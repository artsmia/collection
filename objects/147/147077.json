  "text": "Jack Perlmutter was a nationally prominent Washington, D.C. painter and printmaker who called himself an abstract realist. Abstract realism (sometimes called deconstructed realism) walks the line between pure abstraction and representational, nature-based realism. In this color lithograph produced in the 1980s, Perlmutter depicts an aerial view of a park or other urban space, with a prominent road or pathway bisecting the landscape. Here, Perlmutter sacrifices naturalistic representation in favor of near-total abstraction, stressing the complex interrelationships of form, color, and surface pattern, which become further emphasized by prominent borders--one pink and one black--surrounding the composition.",
