  "text": "Painted on an oval canvas, this is a self-portrait of a woman artist who looks out directly from the painting with a confident half-smile. Dressed in a tan dress with brown and lace trim, she leans against the wall with one arm crossed at her waist and the other hand holding a lit cigarette. Her hair is pulled back, with wisps falling around her face. The background is nondescript, with just a small cluster of leaves and flowers to the left of her face. The painting is set in a rectangular gold frame, embellished with floral motifs at each of its four corners.",
