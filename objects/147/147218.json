  "text": "Throughout Irving Penn’s long career he photographed a wide range of sitters, whether fashion models or workers. In “Child of Florence, Italy, ” he focused his lens on a five-year old child, who lived in the outskirts of Florence, where Penn was on an assignment for “Vogue” magazine, his longtime employer. Elisabetta Cristiana Giuffrida-Ruggeri later recalled the session with Penn, during which he put her “at ease” throughout, as he photographed her and continued speaking with her.",
