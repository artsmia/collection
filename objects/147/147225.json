  "text": "Since the mid-1990s the photographer Cy DeCosse has been collaborating with the photographer Keith Taylor in experimenting with earlier printing processes, including the platinum-palladium process. As exhibited through the twelve artworks in the portfolio of “The Gates of Florence,” each print is carefully printed to evoke the atmosphere of the original site. DeCosse’s lens and Taylor’s printing evoke the warmth of the sun that shines through the gates of DeCosse’s beloved Florence, the city where he first learned about photography.",
