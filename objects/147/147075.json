  "text": "Beginning in the early 1970s, George Morrison created a series of abstract pen and ink drawings on various colors of paper that feature elaborate, patterns of parallel and intersecting lines covering the entire surface of the paper. He later adapted these patterned line drawings to his printmaking pracitce, creating several editioned lithographs. Like his line drawings, Morrison included a prominent horizon line in the upper portion of the prints, including this example. The insertion of a horizon line signifies the composition as an abstracted landscape with distinct areas of sky and ground meeting at the horizon. Like Morrison’s grand wood collages of the same period, these dynamic “weave” drawings display textured surfaces, realized as intricate passages of fine-lined cross-hatching and shimmering forms arising through chance.",
