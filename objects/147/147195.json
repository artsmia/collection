  "text": "This sculpture is part of the original “Reticulárea” installation that Gego created in 1969. Composed of modular triangular pieces made from aluminum and steel wire connected through flexible articulations, it forms a net-like structure that hangs from two points in the ceiling. The modular triangles vary in size and are constructed by hand using wires of different types, lengths, and thicknesses, which creates the impression of a work that seems to have been made without effort or calculation. The resulting effect is a sense lightness and transparency, allowing the structure to evoke the possibility of limitless growth.",
