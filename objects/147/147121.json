  "text": "In 1838, Scottish painter David Roberts toured the Near East, making him one of the first British artists to gain first-hand knowledge of the region. He went from Egypt to the Sinai and Petra, arriving in Jerusalem at Easter 1839. Remaining there for a few weeks, he then continued north to Lebanon and departed from Beirut in May. From the outset of his journey, Roberts planned to publish a great set of Near-Eastern views, which eventually appeared as The Holy Land, Idumea, Arabia, Egypt and Nubia. He worked with lithographer Louis Haghe (1806-1885) to develop a six-volume magnum opus, containing 247 hand-colored lithographs based on his on-the-spot drawings. To fund the project, he exhibited his original drawings in London and used the exhibition catalogue as a prospectus to recruit subscribers. Four hundred signed up, and the series was published in parts from 1842 to 1849.This was one of the 19th century's most elaborate topographical publications illustrated with hand-colored lithographs. It was also one of the last, for photography soon became the preferred medium for views of far off lands. Nonetheless, Roberts's and Haghe's prints remained central to understanding of Egypt and the Holy Land in Victorian Britain.\r\n\r\n\nHere Roberts shows us his visit to the Alexandria palace of Muhammad Ali (1769-1849), Ottoman viceroy and de facto ruler of Egypt, which took place May 12, 1839. The Pasha dresses in clothes no different from those of other courtiers, but his importance is signaled by his position on the couch, the fact that he is the only one who gets to smoke from the hookah, and the presence of an attendant to fan him if need be. The British delegation is led by Colonel (later General) Patrick Campbell (1779-1857), who sits nearest the host and holds a roll of paper. Under discussion was the Britains' hopes for establishment of an overland route to India.",
