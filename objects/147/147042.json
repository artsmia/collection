  "text": "Throughout the 1960s, Maki played with the boundaries between calligraphy and abstract forms by manipulating geometric forms, color, dimensionality, and texture. Bright, solid colors add visual rhythm, momentarily drawing the eye away from the rough textures. In addition to embossing, some colored areas are debossed—depressed instead of raised—thereby creating different levels of depth on a single, flat piece of paper. To create his signature effect of uneven bumpiness on paper, he applied cement to his woodblock.",
