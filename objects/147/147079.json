  "text": "Jack Perlmutter loved urban life, portraying vibrant scenes of action and movement in his semi-abstract paintings and prints. He chose his subjects intuitively, sometimes based on photographs he made while walking city streets. With a penchant for brilliant color and geometric designs. Perlmutter skillfully interpreted the world around him using equal measures of seeing, feeling, and understanding. Here, he captures the complex interrelationships among the various buildings and sets of railroad tracks, emphasizing a strongly receding one-point perspective.Commenting on Perlmutter's urban subjects, Washington Post critic Leslie Judd Portner described his reaction to the work: \"They are so complex in their organization, so over-busy, that they hit the eye like broken glass. And yet you feel the artist’s excitement, his love of the rawness, the newness, the beautiful, exciting, crushing city.”",
