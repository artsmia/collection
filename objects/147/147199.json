  "text": "Conch shells (horagai) have been used in Japan as instruments for Buddhist rituals since the 8th or 9th century. Besides the war drum and the gong, they were also used as battle horns (gunkai or jingai) to conduct troop movements. Since it was used in outdoor terrain, mesh, cord, and sometimes tassels in flamboyant colors were preferred. The conch shell was fitted with a net covering and cord allowing it to be easily carried. In each feudal clan there was one family assigned the duty of blowing the horn and this function was passed down from generation to generation. The mouthpiece of this gunkai is made of silver and engraved on two sides with a family crest of 15 bamboo leaves in a circle (maru ni jūgomai sasa 丸に十五枚笹). This crest was used by several different families throughout Japan and it is therefore not possible today to firmly assign the object to one family.",
