  "text": "Sitges, a small fishing town outside Barcelona, became a center of Spanish modernism with the arrival of a group of artists in the 1890s. At the center of that group was the painter Rusiñol, who established a studio there and organized a series of festes modernistas, festivals that brought together theater performers, poets, literary figures, and artists. He painted this view of a patio on one of his earliest trips to Sitges, capturing the bright Mediterranean sun and the stillness of a quiet afternoon with the warm palette and spontaneous brushwork that would become characteristic of his work after 1890.",
