  "text": "“Raksha” masks were worn by performers during traditional Sri Lankan dances and rituals. Their grotesque expressions, often featuring bulging eyeballs, fangs, and protruding tongues, resemble demons and are intended to avert evil. They are a tribute to the Rakshasas, a race that was believed to rule Sri Lanka earlier and could assume 24 different forms ranging from fire demons to bird-like creatures and serpents. When worn by performers, their fearsome expressions would come to life, creating vivid characters in ritual dances narratives. ",
