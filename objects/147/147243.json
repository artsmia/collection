  "text": "Throughout her career Wendy Red Star has investigated how Indigenous groups are effaced from history and even in the present. This installation, “Their Land,” tackles this very topic by making abundantly visible on the map where Native tribes exist. Based on research Red Star conducted with students at Stanford University, there are 750 white flags, each of them representing tribes that are recognized by governments of the United States, both at the federal and state levels, and others that are self-recognized. For Red Star, “Their Land” is a means to start a conversation about the acknowledged presence and absence of Native American and Indigenous groups throughout the United States, the histories of their locations, and our assumptions surrounding these themes.",
