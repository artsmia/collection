  "text": "Sabbas the Sanctified (439–532) founded this manastery in 483. Three years later. the monastery moved to the site shown here, on the western rim of the Kidron Vally. It is now considered the oldest continuously (with brief exceptions) occupied Christian community in existance. The monastery established the litergy that became standard in Orthodox Church.\r\n\r\nIn 1838, Scottish painter David Roberts toured the Near East, making him one of the first British artists to gain first-hand knowledge of theregion. He went from Egypt to the Sinai and Petra, arriving in Jerusalem at Easter 1839. Remaining there for a few weeks, he then continued north to Lebanon and departed from Beirut in May. From the outset of his journey, Roberts planned to publish a great set of Near-Eastern views, which eventually appeared as The Holy Land, Idumea, Arabia, Egypt and Nubia. He worked with lithographer Louis Haghe (1806-1885) to develop a six-volume magnum opus, containing 247 hand-colored lithographs based on his on-the-spot drawings. To fund the project, he exhibited his original drawings in London and used the exhibition catalogue as a prospectus to recruit subscribers. Four hundred signed up, and the series was published in parts from 1842 to 1849.This was one of the 19th century's most elaborate topographical publications illustrated with hand-colored lithographs. It was also one of the last, for photography soon became the preferred medium for views of far off lands. Nonetheless, Roberts's and Haghe's prints remained central to understanding of Egypt and the Holy Land in Victorian Britain.",
