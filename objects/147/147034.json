  "text": "Drawing deeply upon her family’s small archive of photographs, letters, and a diary from her paternal grandmother, McMaster began a process of imagining and eventually imaging the stories gleaned from these materials. Inspired by both the hardship and the resilience of her ancestors as they navigated life under colonization, McMaster created a series of compositions centered upon a lone, female protagonist—McMaster herself, dressed in a series of variously detailed accoutrements and clothing—traversing diverse natural landscapes. Do You Remember Your Dreams is an evocation of ancestral memories and their relationship to the land, vividly illustrated through the image of the artist’s own profile and an elaborately beaded and feathered headdress set against the earth. Through her diary, McMaster learned that her grandmother was unsuccessful in obtaining government funding to build a home for her family. By tightly cropping the edges of the image to create a dynamic, diagonal view of McMaster’s character and adornment, the photograph is among the finest in this important series devoted to the hopes and dreams of Indigenous women in Canada, and an unforgettable testament to their ongoing presence upon the land.",
