  "text": "The image depicts a person lying on the ground, their body covered in dark ash and body paint, blending with the earthy, textured surroundings. They have a serene, almost ethereal expression. Branch-like structures extend from their head, intertwined with colorful feathers, including prominent blue, red, and white hues. The overall composition creates a striking visual contrast between the natural elements and the human figure, evoking a sense of deep connection with nature.\r\n",
