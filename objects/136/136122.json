  "text": "Kota Ezawa is a Los Angeles-based interdisciplinary artist and educator who repurposes found images of historic events to demonstrate that all histories are subjective, shaped by people and memories and open to distortion by overt or hidden biases. The present watercolor is one of a series of unique works Ezawa produced for his 2018-19 video National Anthem, a two-minute animation featuring reconfigured film stills of NFL football players taking a knee during the playing of “The Star Spangled Banner” to protest police use of lethal force against unarmed African American men. San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick initiated the act of dissent in 2016 and was consequently banished by the league. Here, Ezawa depicts several members of the Miami Dolphins participating in the silent pre-game demonstration, while being filmed by a league cinematographer. “I really like the word ‘translating’ to describe what I’m doing, ” Ezawa noted. “The game is to take something from the world of camera-recorded images and make it kind of a plausible animated image.” Ezawa challenges us to consider the iconic image with fresh eyes, recognizing its symbolic power within the collective consciousness while reflecting on the role of individuals in shaping meaning.",
