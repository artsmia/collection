  "text": "Richard Haas gained fame in the 1970s for his enormous outdoor murals that transformed blank, drab building facades into grand architectural fantasies. In the early to mid-1960s, he was a graduate student and instructor at the University of Minnesota. In 2019, he wrote “I have always retained a strong and positive memory of your city and especially of your institution which I visited on a regular basis and where I learned so much about the history of art. It is your collection of Munch prints that I studied carefully while writing a graduate paper for my art history class on his print work that also taught me so much and whose original techniques I copied in doing my own work at the time.”\r\n\r\nThis image is based on a self-portrait lithograph made by the Norwegian artist Edvard Munch in 1895.",
