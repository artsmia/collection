  "text": "Taking its cue from American “old school” tattoo design; the nose art of World War II-era airplanes; and similar graphics pinstriped onto motorcycles and lowriders in the late 1950s, the “flying eyeball’ design typifies how Rick Griffin turned to popular artistic traditions for inspiration. Indeed, eyes became a recurring motif for Griffin, appearing in many of his graphic designs. Despite the eyeball’s ubiquity in Griffin’s psychedelic designs, the winged eyeball peering through a burning hole in the sky became an iconic design that was strongly associated with the rock band The Jimi Hendrix Experience, and the group’s legendary front man, Jimi Hendrix (1942-1970).",
