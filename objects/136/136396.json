  "text": "Zanele Muholi (South Africa, b. 1972) is a self-identified nonbinary artist, visual activist, and photographer who uses the pronoun “they.” These photos are from their most recent project, Somnyama Ngonyama (Hail the Dark Lioness), a series that positions Muholi’s own identity as a dynamic form of resistance to systems of oppression. Each photograph presented here results from specific, often traumatic, experiences Muholi has had while traveling for work. Using a range of materials as adornment, Muholi creates powerful visual records that defy easy categorization or historical analysis. Prior to this series, Muholi documented the lives of LGBTQIA+ residents of townships throughout South Africa. That project, Faces and Phases, represents the artist’s ongoing work to make visible communities that are often subjected to discrimination, harassment, and violence.",
