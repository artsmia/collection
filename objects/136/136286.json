  "text": "This is the most dramatic design of Ōta Masamitsu’s 12-print series Figures on the Stage in the Shōwa Period (Shōwa butai sugata), showing popular actors in the kabuki stage in the mid-20th century. It shows the actor Onoe Kikugorō VI (1885–1949) in the dance “Gathering Autumn Leaves” (Momojigari). Momijigari is a short dance showing a woman who is transformed into a vicious demon and it is highly demanding on the actor since he must undergo a quick costume change during the performance.",
