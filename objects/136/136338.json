  "text": "After noticing that promotional posters for venues like the Avalon Ballroom and Fillmore West were being collected by concertgoers, Victor Moscoso approached The Matrix nightclub with a proposal: Moscoso would provide the concert promoter with 200 posters for each show, free of charge, with the stipulation that he could sell as many more as he wished through his imprint Neon Rose. The arrangement was to Moscoso’s great advantage because it placed a spotlight on his art and allowed him to capitalize on the growing demand for psychedelic poster art.\r\n\r\nSome Neon Rose poster issues differed from Moscoso’s original designs, as seen in this variant color scheme in which brilliant orange replaces the green borders and flowers of The Matrix’s first edition of 200.",
