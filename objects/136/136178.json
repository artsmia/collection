  "text": "Lebanese American photographer Rania Matar’s incomparable portrait of Huguette Caland and her daughter, Brigitte, is made all the more powerful by the tenderness of their embrace and the visible tears in the younger woman’s eyes. Matar’s physical positioning of these sitters is also a tribute to them: Huguette Caland was a Lebanese artist who was renowned for her feminist abstractions of the feminine form. She passed away in the fall of 2019; this double portrait is a monument to her legacy.",
