  "text": "Traditional dresses known as thobes have historically been made by Arab women according to the cross-stitch embroidery design customs of their particular region in and around Palestine. The embroidery is intricate and elaborate; particularly well-made examples take months to complete. Just as specific designs reference particular geographic regions, color symbolism is also important in conveying the wearer’s marital status: red means married and blue means widowed.",
