  "text": "Philadelphia-based artist Diane Burko is a pioneering feminist organizer and a tireless environmental activist. For over a decade she has been making paintings and photographs about the impact of climate change and has collaborated with the international science community on the issue. This painting depicts the Columbia Glacier in Prince William Sound, Alaska, which has been melting catastrophically and rapidly retreating since 1982. Burko superimposed lines that chart previous heights and positions of the ice over a twenty-five-year period. \r\n",
