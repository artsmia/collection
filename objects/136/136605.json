  "text": "Within two weeks in early 1881, two great fires devasted parts of Tokyo: on January 26 in Ryōgoku and on February 11 in Kanda, across the Sumida River. This print captures the Ryōgoku Bridge in the background. It is based on a sketch the artist Kobayashi Kiyochika made while the fire was ablaze. Occupied with drawing the light effects, the artist was apparently unaware that his own house and studio were also burning down.",
