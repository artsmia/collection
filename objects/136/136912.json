  "text": "Diego Rivera was an internationally acclaimed Mexican modernist painter, draftsman, printmaker, and muralist, whose work ranged from portraits and figurative scenes, to narrative works and large-scale murals extoling the virtues of Mexico’s history, culture, and post-Revolutionary ideals. “All painters have been propagandists or else they have not been painters,” he once proclaimed. “Every artist who has been worth anything in art has been such a propagandist. I want to be a propagandist and I want to be nothing else. I want to use my art as a weapon.” Rivera was a leading figure in the international community of avant-garde artists centered in Paris and while there developed his own variant style of cubism. Like his Mexican contemporaries José Clemente Orozco and David Alfaro Siqueiros, Rivera is best known for his frescoed murals depicting heroic visions of Mexico’s past and present as interpreted though socialist political allegiances.",
