  "text": "Celebrated curator and photographer Edward Steichen, whose “Family of Man” exhibition traveled from the Museum of Modern Art in New York to Minneapolis in 1955, appears as a distant figure in this intriguing photograph. Hardly a portrait, and yet not entirely staffage, the artist rows his own boat across a quiet body of water, heading for an indistinct shore. Taken when Steichen was 88 years old, the photograph appears to contemplate the life and vision of the man who defined early 20 th century fine art photography—and, later, the documentary style embraced by Karsh.",
