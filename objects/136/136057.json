  "text": "A Yoruba diviner seizes this oracle chain in the middle and casts it on a wooden board. The half-nuts of the opele tree—which gives its name to this chain—land with either the outside or the inside facing up. Depending on their numbers, a result emerges that the diviners then interprets in light of the problem for which he is consulted. A Christian medallion has been attached to one of the half-nuts. This remarkable addition illustrates the creativity on the part of the ritual specialist in bringing together different belief systems.",
