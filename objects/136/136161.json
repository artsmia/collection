  "text": "The design firm Elenhank was headed by architect Henry Kluck and artist Eleanor McMaster Kluck. The nicknames of the husband-and-wife duo formed the company’s moniker. The company became a leader in American textile design and production in the post-World War II period. The Klucks were Illinois natives and first established their business in Chicago in 1948. In 1985 they moved to Cambria, California where they lived the rest of their lives. This textile was designed to be used as a wall covering, rather than draped as curtains.",
