  "text": "Gabe Weisberg is a major figure in the study of 19th-century French art—a prolific author, editor, curator, and highly respected connoisseur. He and his wife Yvonne are also avid collectors of French and Belgian art, primarily Naturalist and Realist drawings. Gabe approaches all his endeavors with the eye of an artist. Indeed, as a young man he trained as an artist before focusing on the academic side of his studies. This is a portrait of his uncle, Philip, a prizefighter.",
