  "text": "Having worked closely with the Department of Photography and New Media’s longtime supporter and champion, Martin Weinstein, Fay Gallun and Richard Sweet have created a gift that speaks to our collection’s longstanding interest in social and cultural events and concerns. They provide evidence of the vast capacity of the medium to document, explore, and capture human experiences across the globe, and therefore comprise manifold possibilities for future audiences’ engagement with photographic works of art.",
