  "text": "This needlepoint textile may have been used originally as a fire screen or framed. Embroideries like these were typically manufactured within the home by leisured women in elite families and were often used for home furnishings such as wall hangings, cushions, and furniture coverings. The peak period for this type of needlework spanned the late 1500s to the early 1800s.",
