  "text": "Designed by the leading graphic artists of the West Coast counterculture—Rick Griffin, Alton Kelley, Victor Moscoso, Stanley Mouse, and Wes Wilson—this selection of rock, blues, and folk concert posters exemplifies the energy and optimism of the San Francisco music scene of the late 1960s and early 1970s. Featuring dynamic, brilliantly-colored designs, and sometimes indecipherable text, these groundbreaking posters were commissioned by leading concert promoters to publicize both established and up-and-coming musicians who performed in now-famous venues such as the Fillmore Auditorium and Avalon Ballroom. Aimed at a youthful audience (teens and twenties), these concert posters spoke to the sensibilities of a counterculture movement that embraced an unconventional lifestyle espousing left-leaning politics, self-reliance, use of recreational drugs, blurring of gender norms, free sexual expression, and anti-war activism. Aside from their eye-catching, “psychedelic” designs, the posters serve as time capsules from a time and place when many young people sought a way of life a world apart from their parents’ lifestyle, a utopian counterculture still fondly celebrated by many who experienced it firsthand.",
