  "text": "This print is part of a series of more than 20 prints focused on the subject of soil. It also represents an innovative new approach to printmaking. Starting in 1959, Hagiwara developed a new technique of printing on the back side of the paper as well as the front. He forced the pigment through the paper by dyeing it from the back, producing a textural surface on the front that he then continued to work. This special technique was so laborious and time-consuming, however, that he abandoned it in 1963.",
