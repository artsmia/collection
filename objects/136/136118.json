  "text": "Minneapolis-based artist Jenna Murphy specialized in intaglio printmaking, particularly drypoint, before making the leap to digital drawing in 2017. Using sophisticated code, Jenna seeks to create complex, organic abstract drawings that defy their computational process and computer origins. The sharp shapes and larger amoeba-like form in Heart Under Attack seem to grow, move, and breathe spontaneously, The rich play of light on dark echoes the velvety effects of a handmade work of art. In the artist’s words, she is exploring how to achieve “similar tactile qualities through computational sketches. These recent studies aim to push the boundaries of what a contemporary drawing can be, with hopes to blur the lines\r\nbetween the constructs of Fine and Digital arts.”",
