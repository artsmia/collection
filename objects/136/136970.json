  "text": "Born in Montana, David Rathman has earned a national reputation for his incisive observations of American life. The subjects he explores range from competitive sports such as boxing and football, to gunslingers of the Old West, to themes of modern warfare. Landscapes and interior scenes also appear in his work, such as this geometric architectural study of a well-lighted institutional corridor. Though devoid of figures, human activity is implied in the presence of multiple doors and other potential egresses included in scene. By omitting most color and any eye-catching details, he encourages the viewer to observe the scene’s unusual perspective and the corridor’s repetitive geometric configurations, including the lone Exit sign.",
