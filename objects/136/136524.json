  "text": "Martha Driessen is a self-taught photographer based in Minnesota. Drawn to documenting the lives of Chicano communities across the Midwest, her photographs capture moments of joy, connection, and contemplation that might otherwise have been lost in the tumult of street fairs, holiday celebrations, and family gatherings. As a bicultural woman photographing Mexican culture on both sides of the US border, Driessen reveals the commonalities across (and despite) the political divide.",
