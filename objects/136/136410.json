  "text": "Elliott Hundley is known for his dense multimedia compositions that reference both art history and mythology, weaving together scenes from the past with familiar imagery taken from the contemporary world. The work Revolutionary Song, 2016 loosely draws inspiration from Antonin Artaud’s play There Is No More Firmament (1933). Devoid of traditional narrative structure and identifiable protagonists, the play utilizes visuals, sound, gesture, and language to confront the viewer and create an impactful, visceral state of chaos.\r\n\r\nReferencing similar mechanism employed by Artaud, Hundley intricately crafts his tableaux from a wide-ranging selection of materials and sources. Beginning with an elaborate photo shoot in which his friends and family are cast to embody characters or ideas expressed in the narrative, the resulting photographs are blown up, cut up, and affixed onto the surface of the works. Through a process ranging from gradual accumulation to spontaneous mark making, Hundley builds up the surface of his works using paint, magazine cutouts, fabric, straight pins, found objects, and other materials sourced from this extensive archive. These formally elaborate constructions play with abstraction and representation, inviting the viewer to create narrative and meaning.",
