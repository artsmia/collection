  "text": "The stylized body of this figure is beautifully carved as a column defined to fit within a one and a half inch (3.8 cm) diameter. The bulging neck is partially covered by resin in which abrus seeds and a beaded necklace have been mounted. The figure’s feet form a narrow platform embedded into the tapered iron rod. The limited contextual information concerning its utilization alludes to its placement in sacred groves. Using the rod to stabilize it upright in the ground, the figure would have been used in cults controlling misfortune and received periodic offerings.",
