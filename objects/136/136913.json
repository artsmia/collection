  "text": "Théophile Alexandre Steinlen was a renowned Swiss-born French painter, sculptor, illustrator, printmaker, and designer best known for his Art Nouveau posters of bohemian cabaret culture of turn-of-the-century Paris. Steinlen was aligned with a circle of avant-garde artists centered in Montmarte neighborhood of Paris that included Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Louis Anquetin, Adolphe Willette, and Félix Vallotton. Animals, especially cats, figured prominently in his work. At the same time, Steinlen’s graphic art displayed a deep concern for social justice and compassion for the poor and working classes. A prolific draftsman and printmaker, Steinlen published some 2, 000 illustrations during his career and more than 600 editioned lithographs and etchings.",
