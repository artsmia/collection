  "text": "Richard Haas gained fame in the 1970s for his enormous outdoor murals that transformed blank, drab building facades into grand architectural fantasies. In the early to mid-1960s, he was a graduate student and instructor at the University of Minnesota. In 2019, he wrote “I have always retained a strong and positive memory of your city and especially of your institution which I visited on a regular basis and where I learned so much about the history of art.”\r\n\r\nIn preparation for cutting his printing block for this woodcut, Haas chose to freely paint the composition with a Japanese brush rather than carefully drawing it with a pencil. The sharp contrasts of light and dark, the painterly approach to woodcut, and the moody atmosphere all stem from his close study of the work of Edvard Munch.",
