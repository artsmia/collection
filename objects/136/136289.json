  "text": "Victor Moscoso created this eye-dazzling poster for Junior Wells’ performances at The Matrix, one of the first concert venues in San Francisco to feature psychedelic music, operating from 1965 to 1972. The poster was the initial release from a series of psychedelic posters issued under Moscoso’s newly formed Neon Rose publishing brand. In becoming his own publisher, Moscoso ensured that he would have complete artistic control over his poster designs. The Neon Rose series is renowned for its bold compositions, brilliant colors, and “pulsating” visual effects. Indeed, the series features some of the most iconic images of the psychedelic era.",
