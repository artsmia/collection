  "text": "Richard Haas gained fame in the 1970s for his enormous outdoor murals that transformed blank, drab building facades into grand architectural fantasies. In the early to mid-1960s, he was a graduate student and instructor at the University of Minnesota. In 2019, he wrote “I have always retained a strong and positive memory of your city and especially of your institution which I visited on a regular basis and where I learned so much about the history of art.” \r\n\r\nHe has periodically returned to make watercolor studies of the architecture of Minneapolis. Here he depicted the University’s Weisman Art Museum, designed by starchitect Frank Gehry. His translation of Gehry’s structure into a planar study invites comparison to the contraste de formes compositions made by Fernand Léger in the 1910s.",
