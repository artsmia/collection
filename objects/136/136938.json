  "text": "Dan people call this type of figure mü le, or “wooden person.” The renowned Ivorian master carver Zlan, who died in 1960, once reminisced one of his mü le: “I went to a chief of the Dan, named Bu, in Tuba … [F]or him I carved a figure with a child on the back. For it he gave me a sheep, a goat, and a large garment. On Bu’s command I carved the woman as his head wife looked.” Although not carved by Zlan himself but possibly by one of his pupils, this maternity was made as a prestige object for a chief or wealthy patron. It is one of the few genres in African art that often portrays actual persons, be it in idealized form.",
