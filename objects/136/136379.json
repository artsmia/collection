  "text": "This concert poster by Victor Moscoso was an instant hit in the Bay Area music scene and became an icon of the psychedelic sixties and even seventies. It was never reissued like other Neon Rose posters, and so remains rare, yet it is nevertheless well-known for its simple design, vibrating color scheme, and wavering letterforms.\r\n\r\nIn more recent memory, Moscoso’s design inspired the movie posters of Cameron Crowe’s Almost Famous (2000), a semi-autobiographical film set in 1973 about a teenage boy who poses as an adult journalist so he can write a Rolling Stone cover story on the rise and fall of fictional rock band Stillwater.",
