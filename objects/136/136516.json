  "text": "“I have to admit, I didn’t know I was making artistic photographs. It was a discovery for me.” For years, the young Samuel Fosso—born in Cameroon to Nigerian parents, living in Bangui (Central African Republic)—had been making self-portraits in black-and-white to send to his family in Nigeria. He experimented with props, poses, and costumes in flamboyant 1970s fashion. Much later, in 1994, these private photos were shown for the first time at the African Photography Encounters in Bamako, Mali. Fosso won the First Prize, and realized he was an artist.",
