  "text": "Detroit-based artist Richard Ellington Lewis explores personal identity in this conté crayon self-portrait. Here, Lewis portrays himself in the guise of the prominent German filmmaker, actor, playwright, and director Rainer Werner Fassbinder (1945-1982), emulating the filmmaker’s distinctive manner and style. By merging his own art-world persona with that of Fassbinder, Lewis infers an admiration for the filmmaker as a contemporary artist and performer, while suggesting that Fassbinder’s creative achievements have influenced his own work and practice.",
