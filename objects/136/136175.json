  "text": "With vividly hammered detail, this large brass dish commemorates the epic fall of the Kingdom of Kandy (1592-1815), the last independent state in Sri Lanka (Ceylon) to succumb to British Crown rule. The design echoes that of Kandyan mural painting, with events staged in a series of illustrated panels, accompanied by brief descriptions chased in Sinhalese. Here, the central scene depicts Kandy’s controversial king, Sri Vikrama Raja Simha, enthroned in his palace in full regalia, demanding retribution for the betrayal of his chief minister Ehelepola (Ähälepola). (The minister is shown in the cartouche on the left, defecting on palanquin to the British capital at Colombo.) Ehelepola’s wife and children were left behind and await their horrific fate: [King Śrī Vikrama Rāja Siṅha] commands [Ähälepola] Kumārihāmi to pound the heads of her children on a rice pounder. [Ähälepola] Kumārihāmi is thrown into Bogambara [Kandy] lake. On the inner rim, rows of British Calvary led by Sir Robert Browning swiftly defeat Vikrama Raja Sinha’s army. The king was deposed on March 2, 1815 and is last seen with his queen in a pavilion in Colombo, just prior to their exile to Vellore, in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Despite the violent narrative, flora and fauna abound—evoking the tropical beauty of the Indian Ocean island which had been storied in the West before the time of Pliny. Moreover, this superb example of 19th C South Asian decorative arts typifies a prevailing tendency of British Crown rule, which was to further legitimize its claim by well publicizing the despotic behaviours of ‘oriental’ kings.",
