  "text": "These prints are part of an album of ten sheets about the Ironmongers’ Marching Song (Yagaefu) related to the Iron Foundry at Kanayamachi district in Takaoka, Toyama Prefecture, where the artist was born. The song and dance are still performed during the Goin festival on June 19th in honor of Lord Maeda Toshinaga (1562–1614) who died on that day. Around 400 years ago, Lord Maeda had invited seven metal casters to Takaoka and laid the foundation for the metal industry in this area. The album consists of seven sheets, one for each song, front and back covers and an explanatory sheet.",
