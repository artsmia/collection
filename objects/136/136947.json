  "text": "Have you ever heard a gargoyle gargle oil' Well, you may not have heard one do that but you have now seen one do so! Karl Wirsum loved wordplay and music and those elements are present together in this inventive rendering of a creature known for guarding cathedral corners in a recording/radio studio gargling some sort of elixir on the air. The sounds manifest as music notes and the word \"gAAR-rr-R-GGGOYLE\" which sounds like the noise a gargoyle gargling oil might make!",
