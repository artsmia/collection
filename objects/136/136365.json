  "text": "A woman in a burgundy dress lies on her back, with an attentive coyote standing on top of her. This paper cut-out woman is placed upon jet black paper with a ribbonwork design adorning the bottom. Ribbonwork, created with imported silk ribbons from Europe and stitched onto wool, is a unique art form created by women in Osage, Ponca, and other communities across the North American prairie.\r\n\r\nTo the left, a string connects the woman to two fat raccoons. One is comfortably lounging on his back; he wears a bear-claw necklace and holds ribbonwork in his paw. The other raccoon stands upright, grasping stick figures of the Lone Ranger, a hero of TV and movie westerns, and a well-groomed white woman holding a cell phone and clasping a fancy purse.",
