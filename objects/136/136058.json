  "text": "A wandering Muslim scribe in Algeria may have tucked this pen box under his belt while perusing the countryside to offer his services. The long, rectangular case once held reed pens, and the small attached lidded jar contained ink. This elegant object is made of silver alloy, decorated with red and turquoise beads and stones, and on one side has five silver Algerian coins, minted in the first part of the 19th century.",
