  "text": "The artist who created this basket folded birchback and then secured each side and the bottom onto a flat square base using a straight, looped stitching. She/he then finished the basket by securing a circular lid onto the top of the vessel. Anishinaabe birchbark baskets have been created for personal use and exchange for centuries, and probably millennia.",
