  "text": "In Homage to New York Nancy Spero pushed back against the American art world’s unrelenting focus on Manhattan and Abstract Expressionism. Her solution was to entomb a cluster of New York based artists she felt had received inordinate attention from the art press. She recalled, “I was very angry, feeling frustrated. I wasn’t getting my message out, that I was overlooked.” Two figures flank a phallic yellow ochre tombstone, which rises nearly to the full height of the painting. Wearing rabbit-eared dunce caps, they thrust pink tongues “of defiance and ridicule” at the viewer. They glare outward warding off those who might seek to exhume the dead or pause to pay tribute to their achievements.",
