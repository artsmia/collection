What parent of boys cannot relate to the testing of budding manhood? \r\n\r\nThis drypoint is part of a suite of images created for an exhibition at Spaces, Cleveland, on the theme “The Second Amendment: The Black Panther Party.” The title, Bare Arms, is a gentle act of resistance against America’s extraordinarily permissive attitude toward guns and the concomitant violence.",
