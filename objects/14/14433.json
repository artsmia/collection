  "text": "A group of young boys play a game outside, possibly blindman’s buff. The children’s smiling faces and brightly colored clothes, along with the auspicious symbolism of “boys at play,” communicate joy and liveliness. The artist used the “inside painting” technique to create this scene, employing a tiny brush to paint the image in reverse on the inside of the bottle through its small opening, so that the image shows through the glass.",
