  "text": "A woman gazes through a window surrounded by the branches of a willow tree. We seem to catch her in a private moment of contemplation. Such poetic depictions of women were popular in Chinese art. The bottle is carved from ivory, an expensive material that was also difficult to carve so elaborately. Nonetheless, the scene is expertly sculpted to give the illusion of depth and shadows.",
