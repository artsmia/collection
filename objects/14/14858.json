  "text": "The earliest datable examples of carved rhinoceros horn are from the 8th and 9th centuries, although the Chinese had used the material pharmacologically much earlier. A solid mass of agglutinated hair rather than true horn, the substance was valued for its rarity and rich warm chestnut color, which deepened with years of handling and polishing. Though called libation cups, these vessels would have been primarily used for display, and they would have been accompanied by beautifully crafted hardwood stands. The simple organic shapes favored during the Ming dynasty gave way to increasingly elaborate and detailed forms during the Ch'ing dynasty. Plant forms, ancient bronze vessel motifs, and dragons figure prominently in rhinoceros horn decor, just as they do in jade and lacquer carvings.",
