  "text": "The subject of this portrait is the Dogaressa Morosina Morosini (1545–1614). Dogaressa is the title given to the wife of the Doge of Venice, the elected ruler of the republic. The accompanying portrait of her husband, Doge Marino Grimani, is in the collection of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. From a prominent and wealthy patrician family, Morosini was a patron of the city’s lace industry. She is depicted in a stylish burgundy velvet dress with ruffled lace sleeves and translucent tulle over the shoulders. Notice how the landscape in the window behind the Dogaressa is continued in the background window of the Doge’s portrait. The swaths of silk also link the portraits, acting as bookends that enclose the couple. Whereas Grimani’s portrait was painted by Tintoretto himself, Morosini’s was executed by Tintoretto’s assistants. The pair of paintings date from before Grimani’s election as doge in 1595.",
