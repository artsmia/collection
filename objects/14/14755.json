  "description": "Bowl with high base rim, and striaght flaring sides. It is decorated with a broad band of black perhaps derived from inscription with arabesque background, around the insides, with a similar pattern round on the bottom, and a border composed of triangles and dots around the rim. On the ouside are two lines of black. The whole is covered with deep turquoise-blue transparent glaze which seems to be over the black pattern, and which only comes about half way down on the outside. It is now covered with a golden irridescence over much of the surface. Bowl of Rakka type, wide mouthed, coarse pottery covered with heavy blue glaze that stops short of foot. Rim and narrow band around neck and just below decorated with bands of lines, dots and Mohammedan characters in dark green. Four projecting handles attached at rim and shoulder, placed at regular intervals around neck of bowl.",
