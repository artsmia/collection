  "text": "In the eighteenth and nineteenth century, so-called Orientalist artists in Europe depicted romanticized images of harem life in the Ottoman Empire, spawning an interest in Egyptian dancing. The paintings often include elaborate depictions of garments.\r\n\r\nDepending on region and circumstance, Egyptian dance style and costume vary greatly. The frock on display is characterized by its full-length form; it was worn in a uniquely Egyptian dance called a baladi, which means of the country. This urban dance, which derived from folk tradition, originated at the end of the the nineteenth century in the country's major cities. It was - and continues to be - performed at festive occasions such as weddings.",
