  "text": "Best known for his rural landscapes, the Victorian painter Richard Beavis populated his scenes with picturesque grazing cattle and people hard at work. This impressive figural study, no doubt a preparatory sketch for one of his exoticizing landscapes, exploits the full potential of the chalk medium. Forceful dark contour lines and glimmering white highlights model the mustachioed figure and enliven the surface of the sheet.",
