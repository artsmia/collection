  "text": "Were they true to life, the high collar and netted hat of this royal memorial head would be a brilliant, beautiful red. They were made of coral beads imported from the Mediterranean Sea. And since the Benin king owned all the coral in his kingdom, its use in his outfit signified his far-reaching control of international trade. Each new Oba had a bronze head made to decorate the shrine honoring his deceased predecessor. The hole in the top of the head once held a carved elephant tusk—like the one in the case to your left—chronicling the exploits of the ancestor.",
