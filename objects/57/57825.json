  "text": "Judging from the series title for this print, the intention was to design twenty-eight images inspired by the moon. Today, only two designs are known, suggesting that the publisher abandoned the idea shortly after beginning. For this image, Hiroshige was inspired by a poem originally published in the <I>Wakan Rōeishū</I> (Anthology of Chinese and Japanese Poems for Recitation), compiled in the 11th century by the courtier Fujiwara Kintō:\r\n\r\n\t\t<P><I>It is not unbearable to see maple leaves fall,\r\n\t\t<P>Scattering on the mass-covered ground.\r\n\t\t<P>It is unbearable to feel the wind grow chilly\r\n\t\t<P>And see the whole sky darkening.\r\n\t\t\t\t<P>(trans. by Yoko Woodson)</I>",
