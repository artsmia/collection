  "text": "Originally published ca. 1832 by Wakasaya Yoichi. This is a later edition by Sanoya Kihei from the 1840s.\r\n\r\nJudging from the series title for this print, the intention was to design twenty-eight images inspired by the moon. Today, only two designs are known, suggesting that the publisher abandoned the idea shortly after beginning. For this image, Hiroshige was inspired by a poem originally published in the Wakan Rōeishū (Anthology of Chinese and Japanese Poems for Recitation), compiled in the 11th century by the courtier Fujiwara Kintō:\r\n\r\n\t\tIt is not unbearable to see maple leaves fall,\r\n\t\tScattering on the mass-covered ground.\r\n\t\tIt is unbearable to feel the wind grow chilly\r\n\t\tAnd see the whole sky darkening.\r\n\t\t\t\t(trans. by Yoko Woodson)",
