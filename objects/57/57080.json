  "text": "\"Dear Sir, I am extremely vexed at what is happening to me,\" the Belgian painter Théo Van Rysselberghe wrote to André Marty, explaining his inability to master lithography. In the end, he sent Marty this etching of a Dutch seascape. As a founder of Les XX (The Twenty), which held yearly avant-garde exhibitions in Brussels, Van Rysselberghe was an influential ally for Marty. In May 1894 he convinced the important Association Pour l'Art in Antwerp to exhibit the entire first album of L'Estampe originale.",
