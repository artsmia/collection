  "text": "Lucas depicts Saul of Tarsus traveling to Damascus with his armed retinue with the intention of persecuting followers of Christ. On route, a light from heaven descended upon Saul who fell from his horse onto the ground. He heard a celestial voice asking: \"Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me'\"  For three days, Saul was blinded and could neither eat nor drink. At Damascus, he converted to Christianity and was baptized.\u000b\u000bLike Lucas's engraving, Golgotha,  the artist relegated the key scene of Saul's fall from his horse to the left middle-ground. He focused instead upon Saul's followers in exotic costumes who are not described in any significant detail in the scripture (Acts 9:1-9). The theme of sin and redemption reoccur in Lucas's prints. The breadth and scale of this engraving with its mountainous landscape were exceptional in the history of early 16th century printmaking and are a trademark of Lucas.",
