  "text": "This print's moralizing tone is clear from the man at left, who instructs a mustachioed dandy on how a woman can turn even the wise Solomon into a fool. Related to the Power of Women theme is the folly of caring too deeply about temporal qualities such as strength and wisdom, and the idol here reflects this idea. The military costume suggests the vanity of power; the skull symbolizes the transience of earthly pursuits. The sin of lust is represented by the two dogs sitting just where Solomon's sword points.",
