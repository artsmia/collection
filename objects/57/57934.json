  "text": "John Mason was one of the early students of Peter Voulkos at the Los Angeles County Art Institute (now the Otis College of Art and Design) in the 1950s, when all were exploring the expressive medium of clay. In 1957, Mason and Voulkos established a studio together in L.A. In this early vase, Mason experimented with heavily potted walls, irregular form, and abstracted glazing patterns. These techniques all departed from the idea of the refined ceramic vessel.",
