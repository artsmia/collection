  "text": "Kakinomoto Hitomaro was a great poet and, after his death around 739, he was deified as a Shinto god. In his poem, written here in the upper portion of the print, he emphasizes the loneliness of autumn: \r\n\r\nAh, the foot-drawn trail\r\n    of the mountain-pheasant's tail\r\n   dropped like a down-curved branch\r\n    Through this long, long-dragging night\r\n    must I keep my cushion alone' \r\n\r\nKuniyoshi strengthened the autumnal association within his composition by picturing autumn grasses, the full moon, and maple leaves as decoration on the small folding screen near Hitomaro.",
