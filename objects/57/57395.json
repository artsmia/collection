  "text": "Poverty struck the Gág household when Wanda, the oldest of seven, was just 15: father Anton died of tuberculosis and mother Elisabeth grew frail soon after. Winter Twilight could represent Wanda’s dream of something different. Just one or two impressions of this print are known to bear her hand-coloring, and indeed the glowing windows seem to make the house even more welcoming. The absence of footsteps in the snow suggests that everyone is safely tucked away inside, snug and warm.",
