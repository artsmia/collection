  "text": "Malcolm Myers's exuberant color intaglio print is a tongue-in-cheek commemoration of \"Frankie and Johnny,\" whose tale of love and betrayal and deadly consequences was made popular by a traditional American popular song of the same title. Inspired by one or more actual murders, the song was first published in 1904. It tells the story of a young woman, Frankie, who finds that her lover Johnny was shamelessly cavorting with another woman, Nellie Bly. For \"doing her wrong,\" Frankie shoots Johnny dead. Though Frankie is arrested and jailed for her crime, there is no apparent moral to the story.",
