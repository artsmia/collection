  "text": "Following the example of Peter Paul Rubens, who worked with a stable of printmakers to win fame and riches, Rembrandt collaborated with Leiden etcher Johannes van Vliet, who reproduced Rembrandt's paintings in prints. This large, ambitious composition was based on a painting Rembrandt made for Frederick Hendrik, the Prince of Orange, who, as stadholder was the highest-ranking elected official in the country. It directly challenged Rubens by showing the removal of Christ from the cross as a dismal, physical event rather than a glorious baroque cascade. Even in such a serious production, Rembrandt's idiosyncratic humor comes through, for he assigned himself a cameo role, clutching Christ's arm and glaring outward.\r\n\r\nVan Vliet executed much of the etching; Rembrandt possibly added some finishing touches.",
