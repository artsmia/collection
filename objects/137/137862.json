  "text": "Few depictions of Native Americans are as vividly rendered as this portrait of  Ayshkebahkekozhay (1774-c. 1860), one of the most important 19th century chiefs of the Ojibwe people. Renowned as a warrior and a powerful orator, Ayshkebahkekozhay was involved in negotiating land treaties with United States in 1837 and 1855 whereby millions  of acres of territory were ceded to the government in exchange for payments totaling upwards of a million dollars in cash and goods. When Minnesota achieved statehood in 1858, the formerly Ojibwe territory constituted much of the central and northern portions of the new state.",
