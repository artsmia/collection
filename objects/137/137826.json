  "text": "This is a color photograph of a blue and pink colored galaxy within the black field of space. The image of the galaxy is bent at the center, causing a ripple in the image, so that the light appears to be in the shape of a dove in flight. At the left of the galaxy, towards the top corner of the image, a photograph of several young people in a church pew is stuck into the work’s gold frame.",
