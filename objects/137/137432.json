(The artist intended the OSB plywood texture to be relief printed directly from the plywood, but it was transferred to a lithographic plate when it was determined the OSB plywood matrix was too unstable to edition.) Untitled (Spotlights) B: Relief and screenprint in four colors: indigo blue printed texture of Luan mahogany plywood with four solid flat shapes in lemon yellow, lime green, and red.",
