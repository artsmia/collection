  "text": "Ogata Kamio is a self-taught artist specializing in the optically stunning but extremely arduous art of marbleized clay (neriage). Hundreds of paper-thin layers of colored clay are thrown together, creating a single vessel with distinct, striated patterns. In this case, he then carved the surface and created ridges.",
