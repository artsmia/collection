  "text": "In her screenprint Anti-Retro, Andrea Carlson presents an “imagined non-colonial landscape” as a critical reframing of the past. The title of the print, Anti-Retro, originates from a 1974 interview with Michel Foucault, the French philosopher and historian, who theorized that power emerges from control over how knowledge is produced, shaped, and recorded, ideas that resonate in Carlson’s own work. Here, she introduces familiar images from classic western films—fighting cowboys, a horse and rider, and a falling horse—to reveal the truth of the “Old West,” a romanticized myth that masks the political and cultural ideologies that prevailed during the Euro-American colonization of North America. Carlson equates westerns with the sensationist “mondo” film genre, in particular the infamous 1962 Italian film Mondo Cane, a pseudodocumentary that features a series of fictional or appropriated film sequences of cultural practices from around the world designed to shock the sensibilities of mainstream European audiences. By exposing these fraudulent cultural narratives, Carlson asserts that culture is in a continual state of change and assimilation and requires a reframing of popular (collective) memory.",
