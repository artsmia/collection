  "text": "Untitled (I'll have to get back to you on this), 2007-2019 was completed by the artist over the course of twelve years. The piece epitomizes the busy, clustered scenes that are characteristic of DuCett’s style and commitment indicative of his artistic practice. The viewer is playfully invited to lean-in and look more closely at the tiny vignettes and small occurrences unfolding within the large and disorderly space of the picture frame. Like an archive or a treasure map, objects, icons, and cultural ephemera are superimposed on the infrastructure of a chaotic cityscape. Sheltering numerous small and mischievously placed symbols and images-–including the Minneapolis skyline--Untitled (I'll have to get back to you on this), triggers personal associations and memories in viewers whether they’ve lived in Minneapolis or not.",
