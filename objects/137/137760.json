  "text": "By the time Urban VIII Barberini was elected to the papacy in 1623, the establishment painter Cavaliere d’Arpino had worked over four decades for a succession of popes. (The artist moved to Rome as a young prodigy and began working in the Vatican palace at the tender age of 15.) Yet as prestigious altarpiece commissions were being awarded to artists (many young and unknown) in the 1620s in the newly completed basilica of St. Peter’s during Urban’s reign, Arpino could not secure a contract. At least three commissions had fallen through and gone to other artists. He may have executed this magnificent painting to get in the pope’s good graces. Urban personally identified with the Archangel Michael, as defender of the Catholic Faith and papal authority during the Counter-Reformation. He chose the saint’s feast day for his papal coronation, and the Archangel became his personal impresa, adorning his papal coins and medals. Two weeks after this painting was delivered to the Barberini family palace by one of the pope’s servants, Arpino finally secured a St. Peter’s commission, hired to design a mosaic altarpiece representing the Archangel Michael fighting Lucifer.\r\n\r\nThe Minneapolis painting represents the Archangel already victorious, standing triumphantly upon a prostrate Lucifer, Michael’s bejeweled foot resting on the defeated figure’s head and neck. Arpino imbues the saint with extraordinary physical presence, giving considerable descriptive detail to his wings, costume, and flesh, without sacrificing elegance. The painting remained the Palazzo Barberini (Rome) until 1934, and then with descendants of the family into the 21st century.",
