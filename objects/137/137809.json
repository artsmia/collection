  "text": "Joaquín Sorolla y Bastida is known as one of the most prominent Spanish Impressionist painters. From a young age Sorolla showed his talent as an artist – by the age of 15 he won prizes for his work at the Academy of Valencia. A scholarship the artist received in 1885 allowed him to travel to Rome, where he painted this portrait of his friend and fellow artist, Francesco Santoro (1844─1927). Sorolla’s attention and sensitivity to light is evident in the large, confident brushstrokes that give the figure a golden aura, and broad pink highlights across the face, ears, and jacket sleeve.  Note also the delicate glint atop Santoro’s hat and pinky ring.",
