  "text": "Because of its dimensions, the exact purpose of this beautifully embellished textile remains unknown, but it could have been made as a cover for a drum, a table, or an altar. The Native nation of the maker is also unknown. There are clues within this piece that suggest influences of several tribal traditions including those of the Dakota, Lakota, Anishinaabe, Metis, Cree, and Blackfeet. The artist was able to create a complex yet balanced set of design elements that required an immense amount of time and skill. The artist(s) incorporates various shades of blue, green, yellow, orange, white, and pink that create a striking contrast to the rich red background, and reveals the work of an artist who is paying careful attention to maintaining negative space for aesthetic impact.",
