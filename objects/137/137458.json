  "text": "During his multiyear collaboration with Highpoint Editions, Santiago Cucullu designed a series of diptychs, each comprising an ukiyo-e–style color woodcut—a printmaking method of Japanese origin that builds images with multiple carved woodblocks—and a related, interpretive text printed as a single-color relief print. The diptych thus functions as an ekphrastic poem (in Greek, ekphrasis means “description”), an ancient rhetorical device exemplified by vivid, often dramatic, description of real or imagined scene, or more commonly, a work of art. Here, Cucullu also introduces the element of chance in juxtaposing unrelated imagery derived from architectural and decorative styles, film, literature, and cartoons, displacing them from their usual context to generate unexpected narratives and meanings.",
