  "text": "British artist Frank Craig was in great demand as a portraitist and as an illustrator for books and magazines. He primarily worked in America for the likes of Scribner’s, Harper’s, and McClure’s. As seen in the present parlor scene, his work was deft and had a strong play of light well-suited to reproduction. Here he takes on the petty social dramas of the leisure class.",
