  "text": "Aegidius Sadeler Sadeler was the court engraver to Emperor Rudolf II and his successors, Matthias and Ferdinand II. Sadeler’s brilliant engraving style and technique are indebted to the work of Hendrik Goltzius. In addition to engraving portraits, he worked plates based on the designs and paintings of major artists—here the work of Bartholomeus Spranger. The engraving shows the risen Christ’s encounter with Mary Magdalene, who initially mistakes him for the gardener (John 20:11-18). He raises his wounded hand, famously saying “Noli me tangere.” (Do not touch me.)",
