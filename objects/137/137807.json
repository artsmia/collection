  "text": "Cloudless Blue Egress of Summer recalls the history of the Castillo de San Marcos, (built c. 1672), St. Augustine, FL. The fort was used as a prison for Indigenous peoples during the Second Seminole Wars (c. 1835-1842) and the Indian Wars (c. 1875- 1887). The Castillo is where Brigadier General Richard Henry Pratt developed his plan of forced assimilation, best known for the dictum of “kill the Indian in him, and save the man.”\r\n\r\nHighlighted in the film are moments ranging from Seminole Chieftain Coacoochee’s escape (1837) to ledger drawings made by the prisoners of the Indian Wars (c. 1875-1887). Cloudless Blue Egress of Summer demonstrates the persistence of presence and memory in the face of cultural genocide through, as Hopinka states, “small samplings of space and hope.”",
