  "text": "Elizabeth Hickox is widely recognized as being one of the most important indigenous basket makers of the 20th century. At the height of the “Indian basket craze” in the late 19th and early 20th century, Hickox created unique baskets for sale to high-end collectors and museums. Her incredibly fine work is apparent in the 800 stitches per square inch that appear in her baskets. Hickox combined plant material, usually maidenhair fern, with yellow porcupine quills (dyed with lichen) to create a strong color contrast and dynamic abstract designs. The lid’s tall knob handle is one of Hickox’s hallmarks and her own invention. Hickox was an entrepreneur, and exclusively sold her baskets to art dealer Grace Nicholson, who marketed them for her to collectors. In turn, Hickox was able to provide a steady income for her family, enjoy travel, and live a cosmopolitan life.",
