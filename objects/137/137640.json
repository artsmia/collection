  "text": "Alice Neel has here depicted herself and second daughter Isabetta at a community health\r\nclinic in New York City. They can be seen in the center of the painting at far right, a serene\r\nmoment of calm amid a chaotic scene. Neel’s first child died before the age of one just a year earlier.\r\nThe contorted faces and frenzied look to the beds and interior spaces may convey her anxiety and\r\nprotective feelings for Isabetta. Neel became known later for her psychologically charged portraits\r\nthat capture and express her sitters’ thoughts and personality. That intuition is already at work here.",
