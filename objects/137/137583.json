  "description": "Woodcut trace monotyped in oil-based black ink from a basswood block carved by the artist. The block was inked with a standard roller and printed with a combination of hand barens and wooden spoons per the artist's instructions resulting in different densities and tonalities. This produced a series of similar, but variant impressions. The final impressions were each backed with an additional sheet of paper using wheat starch and trimmed to size.",
