  "text": "Henry Monnier was a French caricaturist, playwright, and actor active in the mid-19th century. He devoted the early part of his career to drawing and printmaking, moving on later to concentrate more on theater. His work mostly studied the foibles of the bourgeoisie. He studied with great artists, such as Girodet and Baron Gros. Daumier was also a guiding light. The sitter of this portrait remains unidentified.",
