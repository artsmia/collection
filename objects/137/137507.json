  "text": "Early in its existence, Highpoint Editions embarked on what would become a three-year lithography collaboration with Joel Janowitz, a Boston painter and watercolorist known for his masterly ability to instill a dreamlike, meditative mood into a realistic setting. Janowitz has long explored the on-campus greenhouses at Wellesley College, where he once taught. In Janowitz’s greenhouses, lighting, and color are exaggerated or muted to an unnatural degree until the viewer experiences the humid, misty air and thriving plant life and relives memories of other places and times. He says, “Within this structure I have found a visual metaphor for the simultaneity of multiple ways of seeing, as well as for the many filters through which we see and understand the world.”",
