  "text": "Rendered in black and violet ink, Lauren dela Roche’s Mourning Doves prominently features three female nudes set in an exotic, but enigmatic interior embellished with assorted birds, plants, spider webs, moths, and inanimate objects. Two of the women are seated, each displaying a “double” face, while the larger, recumbent figure does not, perhaps serving as a representation of the artist herself. The drawing’s strongly flattened pictorial space and distinctive patterning of surfaces are characteristic of dela Roche’s idiosyncratic approach, which relies on a combination of intuition, improvisation, and autobiography. The work’s title likely refers to the group of female protagonists, whose contiguity is mirrored in the nearby bird’s nest sheltering three speckled eggs, long interpreted as a symbol of birth and fertility, but also of hope and renewal. The meaning of dela Roche’s dream-like narrative is intentionally elusive, designed to operate in the realm of imagination.",
