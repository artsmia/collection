  "description": "Six-color etching and screenprint with chine collé and hand-cut Gampishi oversheet: The first plate is printed in light green, light blue, light brown, and light gray inks from an aquatint with a brown chine collé element. The second plate is printed in black ink with etching, sugar-lift, spit-bite, drypoint, scraping, burnishing with the two lower comers cut at diagonals and reassembled after inking and prior to printing. The oversheet is white Gampishi which was screenprinted. 136 diamond shapes were hand-cut according to placements designated by the artist and attached using 10 diamond shapes cut from BEVA in placements designated by the artist. The Gampishi oversheet being attached at irregular intervals will dynamically respond to its environment with changes described by the artist as \"expected and welcome.\" To allow movement and protect the oversheet from damage, each print was mounted using Kozo-Shi strips to museum board with an 8-ply museum board window overmat.",
