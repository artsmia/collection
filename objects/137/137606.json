  "text": "Martine Gutierrez’s Indigenous Woman, is a fictional 124-page glossy fashion magazine dedicated to “Mayan Indian heritage.” Three years in the making, the project was conceived and executed entirely by the artist, who played the role of the model, photographer, creative director, author, and editor. “What it took to create Indigenous Woman has been part of my practice for a long time: making something seem effortless, bigger and more glamorous than what it actually is, ” she says. “It was also a question of ‘who is the audience? Who are my advertisers?’ I was making every decision because I was the stylist, the makeup artist, the model. I am the client. That kind of autonomy is something that I had never found in the real world.” The publication mirrors the format of a traditional beauty magazine, complete with fashion editorials, hair and make-up features, and a profusion of advertisements. The magazine format allowed Gutierrez to stage an in-depth presentation of how personal identity is at once fluid and subjective, subverting traditional and often rigid social norms that limit variation to dichotomies such as ‘male’ vs. female’, ‘straight’ vs. ‘gay’, and ‘minority’ vs. ‘white’. Complex, sophisticated, and convincing in its fabricated aura of realism, the faux magazine invites viewers to examine their own preconceptions about gender, race, and orientation, while simultaneously raising questions about diversity, cultural appropriation, and commercialization.",
