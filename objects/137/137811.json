  "text": "A series of photographs arranged as a unit of five presented in a vertical, contiguous arrangement and a sixth hung to the upper right of that assemblage. Each photograph is framed in black and displays a cropped version of a black and white photograph depicting police dogs and fire hoses directed against young black people. In the sixth image to the far right, a figure appears to be running away from the chaos—literally breaking away from the scene of violence at left. Four of the six photographs are overlaid with a sky-blue color, while two others are overlaid with a medium pink.",
