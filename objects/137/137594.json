  "text": "St. Paul–based painter and printmaker Carolyn Swiszcz scrutinizes the urban and suburban landscape for the mundane and inelegant monuments of daily life. In her most recent collaboration with Highpoint Editions, Swiszcz produced a series of unique prints using the monotype process, including Pizza Doctors, La Crosse. For this project, Swiszcz selected restaurants and other retail businesses of dubious architectural value and transformed them into vivid, jewel-toned landmarks, a paradox that suggests a tongue-in-cheek interpretation. Though her scenes are devoid of human activity and appear isolated or abandoned, the rich colors and vibrant patterns allow us to enjoy the friendly side of these ubiquitous “neighborhood eyesores.”",
