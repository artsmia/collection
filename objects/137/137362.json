  "text": "A small painting with a red border depicts in the foreground a figure with blue skin tearing a large white bird’s beak open. Blood spills out of the bird’s mouth; an onlooker stands just behind the blue figure. In the background, a group of three figures – one with white skin – are gathered amongst flowering trees with two cows and a calf; they seem to talk amongst themselves. All of the figures are standing on bright green grass, with a glimpse of blue sky in the highest register of the painting.",
