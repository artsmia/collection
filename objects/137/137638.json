  "text": "Renowned fiber artist Sheila Hicks regularly moves back and forth between extremes in scale. Small-scale works like this, which Hicks calls “minimes,” regularly emerge from her daily artistic practice. They offer chances to experiment with technique and work through ideas in a process Hicks calls intuitive observation. Elements of these small creations often find expression in her larger, monumental works. But on their own, Hicks’s “minimes” offer rare glimpses into the artist’s working methods and daily life. \r\n",
