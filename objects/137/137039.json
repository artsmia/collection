  "text": "The origins of the necklace are something of a mystery. It was left unclaimed at a pawn shop in central Pennsylvania during the Depression by an elderly Jewish couple, their names long since forgotten, who had come to Pennsylvania as refugees prior to the First World War. The donor’s grandfather, who had a jewelry shop in the decades prior to World War Two, also operated the pawn shop where the couple left the necklace. It descended in his family.",
