  "text": "Recognized as one of the leading figures in contemporary art in Singapore, Jason Lim (b. 1966) identifies himself as a “ceramicist and performance artist, two seemingly disparate practices which resolve in the artists’ recurring interest in the changeability of natural phenomena. In this series, Lim evokes a vocabulary of thought ubiquitous in the Buddhist traditions of Asia: dharma, being the underlying law of reality, or the teachings of the Buddha; and the lotus, symbolic of purity, transcendence (i.e. floats above murky water), and enlightenment. That the sculpture dissolves and then is re-born speaks to the cyclical nature of existence; to make peace with this ephemeral stasis is what unfurls the subtle aspects of the Buddhist worldview. Lim’s work is neither proselytizing nor fixed, and instead a meditation on reality expressed with an economy of potent means.",
