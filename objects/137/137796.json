After studying and working in New York and California, he returned to the Twin Cities, where he worked at a plumbing supply company and taught studio art at various colleges. Sussman liked rugged subjects. Minnesota’s rocky North Shore along Lake Superior was a favorite place for him to go out and set loose his brushes.",
