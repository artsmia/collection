After studying and working in New York and California, he returned to the Twin Cities, where he worked at a plumbing supply company and taught studio art at various colleges. Sussman liked rugged subjects. Here he has made a closeup study of what appears to be the bucket of a steam shovel or dredger with heavy chains attached.",
