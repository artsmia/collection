  "text": "Richard Sussman was born in Minneapolis and studied at the Minneapolis School of Art (now MCAD), then part of the Minneapolis Society of Fine Arts, Mia’s parent organization. After studying and working in New York and California, he returned to the Twin Cities, where he worked at a plumbing supply company and taught studio art at various colleges. Sussman liked rugged subjects and usually worked outdoors. We are not sure whether this dune scene comes from his time in New York or during his wartime service as a designer and model maker at a shipyard on San Francisco Bay.",
