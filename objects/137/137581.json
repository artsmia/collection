  "description": "Woodcut trace monotyped in oil-based black ink on three sheets of paper from two basswood blocks carved by the artist. The block was inked with a standard roller and printed using a combination of hand barens and wooden spoons per the artist's instructions resulting in different densities and tonalities. This produced a series of similar, but variant impressions. The impressions were each joined and backed with three additional sheets of paper using wheat starch and trimmed to size.",
