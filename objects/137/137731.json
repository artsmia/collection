  "text": "An accomplished commercial and fine art photographer, Kern turned his focus to the young 4-H members and farm workers who did not receive accolades at Minnesota’s celebrated county fair animal contests. His compassionate view of these children—many of whom were near tears when he photographed them—is evident in the heroic poses they strike for his camera. Kenzi’s graceful contrapposto was unbidden—she told Kern that she regularly posed for the camera on her own time—and lends an air of Regency glamour to an otherwise humble setting. Her luminous portrait encapsulates the empathy at the heart of Kern’s project, channeling his respect for the sitter, who remains unbowed in defeat.",
