  "text": "Kenji Nakahashi worked across media throughout his career making images that were organic, based on nature but often embellished and transformed. This drawing conveys his personality and imagination well. Viewers confront an orange balloon propelled by the air expelled as it gradually deflates while soaring through the air. It appears alive – Kenji has given it a smiling face. What sound would it make? What will happen after it flies past?",
