  "text": "Selma Fernández Richter turned her lens to refugee communities at about the time that she herself immigrated to the United States from Mexico. Here, a young child, named Planet, embraces a toy fire truck. The Karen state flag, images of cars, and holiday lights that adorn the room allude to the complexities of migration. Beyond the frame of this image lie a network of other families and an aid organization with whom Fernández Richter connected while making the series. All helped Planet’s family to start their new life in the Twin Cities.",
