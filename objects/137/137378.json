  "description": "A suite of eight prints from nine laser-engraved Plexiglas plates in the shape of a flying bird, five bird heads, a woman's legs, an ape, and an abstract shape in red, blue, and black inks. The plates were printed in four fixed overlapping arrangements designed by the artist by chance. Seen as a group, these arrangements suggest the nine shapes being tossed to the side, bottom, or top edges of the picture frame. Four panels of the eight were printed in these arrangements with the plates inked and wiped intaglio style only. The other four were printed in these arrangements after adding a relief roll of ink in addition to the inked and wiped lines. The intaglio printed lines stand visibly on the relief printed flats.",
