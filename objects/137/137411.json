  "description": "Eight-color lithograph printed on two sheets of paper. The pale blue bottom sheet has five colors: light blue and medium blue atmospheric washes; dark blue calligraphic marks; black figurative drawing all executed by the artist on Denril to create photolithographic plates; and white screenprinting ink applied through a pochoir stencil. The translucent mulberry top sheet is printed with white circles executed by the artist on Denril to create a photolithographic plate; red and black printed 'threads' created by stitching Mylar with thread to make photolithographic plates; the center of each white circle was cut by hand to reveal portions of the bottom sheet, and the mulberry top sheet was stitched with white thread to the bottom sheet in three places at the top.",
