  "text": "In a series of vignettes, the artist Kenneth Tam and his father act out several contrived scenes. The two stand together in a shower while wrapped in plastic or apply a dark ointment to each other’s abdomens; they move furniture. The absurd, playful, or realistic scenes highlight the intimacy of their proximity. In that closeness, as Tam notes, their bodily movements help “examine the interpersonal tensions that exist in Asian father/son relationships.” Their “acts of silence” contain elements of care and demonstrate how these can be carried out in what Tam calls a “fraught space.”",
