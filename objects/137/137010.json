  "text": "Renzo Vespignani was a Roman painter, printmaker and illustrator. Having come to maturity in Italy during World War II, he was acutely aware of social and political concerns, and his art often focused on the plight of the working class. This beach scene stems from 1949, a time of relief and some optimism for many Italians, and shows ordinary people relaxing on the crowded beach of Ostia.",
