  "text": "This entirely hand embroidered textile was probably intended for use as a table covering. Such decorative cloths were highly prized and either covered or removed when the table was used. The embroidery was the work of Abigail Goodwin and her eldest daughter Anna-Maria. It took eight years to complete the project; beginning and end dates (1737 and 1745) are embroidered at each end of the carpet. Tragically, Anna-Maria died in 1743. For the following two years, Abigail continued the project on her own. Among other surviving carpets made during this period, this example is exceptional for its remarkably fresh colors. It is possible that it was never used given its association with Anna-Maria and her unfortunate early death.",
