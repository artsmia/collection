  "text": "Richard Sussman was born in Minneapolis and studied at the Minneapolis School of Art (now MCAD), then part of the Minneapolis Society of Fine Arts, Mia’s parent organization. After studying and working in New York and California, he returned to the Twin Cities, where he worked at a plumbing supply company and taught studio art at various colleges. Sussman liked rugged subjects. When working outdoors, he returned again and again to specific, now largely anonymous, sites. Industrial sites, such as this waterside facility captured his imagination in the early years of his career.",
