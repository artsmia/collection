  "text": "Fernández Richter worked in close collaboration with a number of immigrant communities within the Twin Cities in the course of grappling with her own move from Mexico to the United States. Her photographs within the homes of Karen refugees from Myanmar are not merely documentary; instead, they capture the complexity of their position—socially and politically—in contemporary America. Notable for her masterful compositions of everyday life, Fernández Richter has a strong capacity for finding the emotional heft in small details— the fading floral pattern on a sofa, the soft cheek of a child pressed against a plastic fire truck—to make the lives of her immigrant subjects accessible.",
