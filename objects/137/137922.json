  "text": "Roughly until the 1960s, every five years the Dadiya peoples in eastern Nigeria would celebrate Kal, a festival that marked the culmination of male coming-of-age ceremonies. Young men were initiated into adulthood, learning the moral precepts and social obligations that came with their new role. During the final celebrations they danced branding these sickles above their heads. Decorated with chiseled motifs on the blade, and wrapped in a coiling strip around the handle, these implements resemble actual farming tools. They speak to the value of work and community instilled in the young adults.",
