  "text": "Jason Lim is one of the leading contemporary artists in Singapore, identifying as both a ceramicist and performance artist—two seemingly disparate practices that come together in exploring the changeability of natural phenomena. In this series, Lim evokes the vocabulary of ubiquitous Buddhist traditions: dharma, the underlying law of reality, or the teachings of the Buddha; and the lotus, symbolic of purity, transcendence (floating above murky water), and enlightenment. That the sculpture dissolves and is then re-born speaks to the cyclical nature of existence; to make peace with this ephemeral stasis is what reveals the subtle aspects of the Buddhist worldview. Lim’s work is a meditation on reality, expressed with an economy of potent means.",
