  "style": "21st century",
  "text": "The deconstruction of long-held myths about Native American culture and traditions lies at the heart of Julie Buffalohead’s artistic practice. In her lithograph Revisionist History Lesson, Buffalohead addresses the long-standing conflict over how the colonization of North America is portrayed in mainstream history and, by extension, popular memory. Here, a coyote, the traditional embodiment of a Native American trickster, lies on its back and plays with four shadow puppets representing the North American continent, a running rabbit wielding a tomahawk, a sailing ship like those of Christopher Columbus and other early European explorers, and an openmouthed turtle grasping an arrow. The two animal figures represent Native culture, while the continent and sailing ship symbolize the foreign subjugation of the continent. Though playful in tone, Buffalohead’s pictorial narrative challenges the widely embraced but largely mythic tale of the founding and expansion of the United States, along with its political and religious ideologies, and suggests instead a revision, one that includes the horrific consequences of colonization on Native life and culture.",
