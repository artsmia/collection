  "text": "Although Julie Buffalohead’s work cannot be reduced to a single interpretation, the characters in them can imply meaning. The silhouettes of North America and the sailing vessel may be seen as symbols of Western colonialism, which viewed the world as a place to be mapped, objectified, and owned. In contrast, the rabbit and turtle might suggest Indigenous perspectives on land and place, the stewardship of Turtle Island (North America), and the role of animals in Ponca creation stories that guide individuals in the appropriate ways of being and acting in the world. At the center is the coyote, a stand-in for the viewer, connected by lines to these other elements. While the props are dark and flat, mere objects, the coyote is rendered with detail, tenderness, and texture, each element of her physicality carefully shaded with precision and care.",
