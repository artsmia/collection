  "text": "To perform with this monumental and heavy mask, a dancer has to be strong and well-trained. Called Bedu, meaning “moon” in the Nafana language, the mask is believed to represent a buffalo-like spirit animal. Male-female pairs of Bedu masks are danced during harvest festivals and at funerals to purify villages, protect the inhabitants from sickness and danger, and to promote the fertility of women and crops. \r\n\r\nThe mask shares geometrical composition, abstract designs, and striking color scheme with the nearby Kikuyu dance shield, likely because both were made to be seen in motion.",
