  "text": "Known principally as a painter, Lisa Nankivil creates luminous linear works that explore qualities such as motion, spatial relationships, and hierarchy. Streaming exemplifies Nankivil’s intuitive creative process, which relies on the dynamic interplay of line, color, texture, space, and light to generate the work’s aesthetic and conceptual content. As in her paintings, Nankivil builds her print layer by layer, adding both clarity and complexity as the work progresses. Contrasting colors and tones induce a “push-pull” visual effect that invites close inspection of the work’s intricate details and surface textures. Formally and conceptually, the print elaborates on the intangible nature of abstraction, evoking a range of emotional and perceptual responses.",
