  "text": "When made from precious hardwoods, hanging lanterns were typically imaginative and rather ornate during the late Ming and Ch'ing era (17th-18th century). Within aristocratic homes, lanterns were suspended from high beams to illuminate dim interiors and enliven the tall, dark ceilings with their delicate, lattice designs.\r\nThis pair is made with folding frames making for easy storage. The frames are also designed with four \"feet\" that allowed them to be set on a table to function more as a lamp than a suspended lantern. While paper screens were used in less expensive lighting, these panels are silk. Glass became popular during the 19th century. Most lanterns burned oil or wax as their light source.",
