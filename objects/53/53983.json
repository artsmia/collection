  "text": "Painter, draftsman, and printmaker Brice Marden creates work characterized by a restrained geometric abstraction. Often mistakenly called a Minimalist, he more closely follows the principles of abstract expressionism and conceptual art. His compositions are typically monochromatic or limited in tonalities, and often feature textured surfaces that reveal the hand of the artist, in contrast to the mechanical or detached approach of the Minimalists. \r\n\r\nIn Ten Days, Marden emphasizes the subtlety of surface, color, and tone within the structural and spatial limits of the rectangle, here expressed in a series of eight related compositions he produced in the short span of ta week and a half. Through this approach, Marden bridges the painterly qualities of the abstract expressionists with the intellectual rigors of Minimalism,  balancing emotional intensity and formal simplicity. For Marden, the content of his work emerges from the materiality of the subject--form, color, texture, and importantly, its lack of reference to the everyday world around us.",
