  "text": "Designed entirely by Bart van der Leck, Het Vlas is the only fully illustrated book of the De Stijl movement and one of the most sophisticated children’s books of the modern era. Visually austere, the book is limited to rectilinear forms presented in primary colors and black and white. The illustrations accompany a fairy tale by Danish novelist and children’s book author Hans Christian Andersen, which follows the life of the flax plant from flowering, harvest, and processing into linen.",
