  "text": "This is the largest and most complex of Giambattista Tiepolo’s etchings. It also stands apart as a traditional religious subject instead of the artist’s usual whimsical, imaginary subjects (capprichi). Yet, his trademark theatrical flair shines through in the rich costumes, lively poses, stage-like presentation of the ruinous stable against an open sky, and especially the flickering light.\r\n\r\nThe “Adoration of the Magi” is the story of the three kings who followed a brilliant star to see the newborn Jesus in Bethlehem. Upon their arrival they fell to their knees to worship him and presented him with gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.",
