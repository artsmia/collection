  "text": "In this imaginary scene, Canaletto visually linked dilapidated modern structures with ancient Roman remains, including a triumphal arch and temple. Overgrown with vines, the large, shadowy arches of the portico frame the luminous view, set near a harbor where ships are moored. A single, forgotten lantern hangs against the sky. Canaletto’s quivering lines amplify the bright, flickering light on aging stone and plaster walls.\r\n\r\nAt left, a bishop’s tomb (recognizable by the statue of a seated bishop on top) shows signs of neglect. Up on rooftop terrace, laundresses have started to hang sheets out to dry. At right, a drummer rests on his instrument while the rest of his troop looks expectantly for someone to disembark at the port.",
