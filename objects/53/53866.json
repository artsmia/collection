  "text": "El Lissitsky and Hans Arp collaborated in the design of this trilingual (German, French, English) publication produced for the 1925 Paris Exposition des Arts Décoratifs et Industriel Moderne. Its text attempts to summarize and lavishly illustrate the major art movements from 1914 until 1924: Constructivism, Verism, Prouns, Compressionism, Merzbild, Neoplasticism, Purism, Dadaism, Simultaneity, Suprematism, Metaphysical Art, Abstraction, Cubism, Futurism and Expressionism.\r\n\r\nIts powerful cover design with the bold black K(unst) and the strident red ISM framing the dates 1914 and 1924 and the list of art movements reflects the avant-garde extreme of Russian graphic design and typography during this era of experimentation and innovation. Kunstismen is the final example of book design rendered by Lissitsky outside of Russia.",
