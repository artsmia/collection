  "text": "Here Canaletto take us out of Venice to the back streets of Padua, a city of beauty and culture, about twenty-five miles inland, where he painted many sights. A lovely, raised terrace adorned with flowerpots and vines growing on trellis, offers fresh air and sunlight, and a spot to relax. A closely related drawing tells us that below the terrace was an unappealing, cluttered space for work and storage. It also tells us that Canaletto revised architecture to suit his artistic desires.",
