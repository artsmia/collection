  "text": "This view of Piazza San Marco (St. Mark’s Square) is framed by the loggia of St Mark's Basilica at left and the Torre dell Orologio (Clock Tower) on the right. The long building with its façade in shadow is the Procuratie Nuove, the residence of the Procurate of Saint Mark’s, a powerful official who oversaw the church’s treasury. He lived on the upper floors and the lower floors were rented to cafes that still serve the city’s throngs of tourists. The sunlit, classicizing façade with the triangular pediment and circular window is the Church of S. Geminiano, which was torn down in 1807 during the Napoleonic occupation of Venice.",
