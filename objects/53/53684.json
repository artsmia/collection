Here he did not concern himself with the reversal of the image inherent to the process of printing etchings: the church of S. Giorgio Maggiore and its tower, seen in the background, are shown in mirror image. The column seen at the right is the one bearing the lion of St. Mark, a patron saint of Venice.",
