  "text": "The prison occupies the center of this view. To the left is the Doge’s palace, in front of which we see a knife grinder working at his wheel. The Ponte della Paglia (Bridge of the Straw), is at center, probably named for the nature of the market located nearby centuries earlier. The huts at either end of the bridge suggest that this heavily trafficked area was attractive to vendors. The large building with many chimneys is the Palazzo Dandolo, now the posh Hotel Danieli.",
