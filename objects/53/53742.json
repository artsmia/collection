  "text": "Richard Diebenkorn was a leading proponent of Abstract Expressionism during the early 1950s, but turned his attention to figurative art later in the decade. In 1967, he returned to abstract art, developing a distinctive style of geometric abstraction that was loosely derived from landscapes and seacoasts seen from the air. Combining both expressive and purely formal elements, he practiced an abstract style of painting and printmaking that was both elegant in its expressive qualities and formally self-referential.\r\n\r\nIn this print, Diebenkorn relies on the hand-drawn drypoint line to define the geometry of the composition. Like many of his works on paper, this print is related to the extensive series of paintings and drawings he collectively titled Ocean Park, named after the neighborhood near Santa Monica where he lived at the time.",
