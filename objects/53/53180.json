In the expert hands of the sttylist, the Tempera permanent wave machine could transform tightly curled hair. into lustrous locks and stick straight tresses to undulating waves. The first US patent for a permanent wave machine was taken out in 1928 by Marjorie Stewart Joyner (1896-1994), the African-American inventor and beautician. The permanent wave hair machine was an equal opportunity appliance, used by black and white women in pursuit of beauty.",
