  "text": "Resembling a torpedo, bullet or rocket sled, this electrifying design looks as if it can propel itself around the house. Touted as a “complete, highly perfected home cleaning system, ” this Royal model is “designed and built to clean and renovate everything in the home more thoroughly and efficiently.” A fairly big assignment for such a small machine, but the user had several updated advantages, including disposable bags for dirt capture (“No more flying dust”) and a toe-operated off-on switch at top rear. The hose for tools attached at the front, and the “nose” snapped off easily for dust bag removal.",
