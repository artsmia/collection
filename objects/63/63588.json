  "text": "Of all the new forms of transport available in Europe in the early twentieth century, airplanes were the fastest. Flying was also the most fantastic way to travel, allowing man to routinely do something once seen as impossible. The Nationale Luchtvaart School, established in 1927 in the Netherlands, is the oldest flight school in Europe. Its first students operated private planes, but it began to train airline pilots in 1931. The simple \"Learn to Fly\" message of the poster was aimed at attracting more workers to the fledgling airline industry, helping it become bigger and, eventually, more accessible to those outside of elite circles. The advertised school still operates out of Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam, where many travelers now see flight as a wearying and uncomfortable element of their vacation rather than the awe-inspiring experience it once was.",
