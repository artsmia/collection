  "text": "This print is from Hiroshige's version of the Eight Views of the Sumida River, and represents the theme of \"autumn moon.\" The buildings on the left represent Mokuboji temple. The artist probably included the temple as a reference to Ishiyamadera temple in the Ømi series. Located on the northeast bank of the Sumida River, the temple grounds, verdant with grass and trees, was a popular picnic site for the people living in the city of Edo. As depicted here, the temple grounds were encircled by a waterway that connected to the Sumida River. Therefore, Mokuboji was easily accessible by boat. Hiroshige renders the temple under the full, harvest moon. The many people shown in the scene may, in fact, suggest the popularity of the picturesque location for moon-viewing.",
