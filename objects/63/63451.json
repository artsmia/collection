  "text": "Chōken is a silk robe with broad sleeves worn in Nō theater. Unlike a kimono, the underarms of the sleeves are left unsewn. This garment is primarily worn by actors playing women’s roles but is sometimes worn by those playing high-ranking warriors or male courtiers.\r\nTypically, a mist pattern is made from a series of connected, flattened clouds; here, they have been further reduced to parallel lines.",
