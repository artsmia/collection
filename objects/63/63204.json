  "text": "This print illustrates travelers approaching the town of Numasu, near Mt. Fuji, just as the full moon rises on the horizon. One of the travelers is a pilgrim journeying to (or returning from) Kompira Shrine on Shikoku Island. The shrine is dedicated to the deity Omono-nushi-no-Mikoto, a patron saint of seafarers. The shrine is located high atop Mt. Kotohira, and hence was a popular destination of &lt;i&gt;yamabushi&lt;/i&gt;, wandering priests who venerate mountains. In the popular imagination, &lt;i&gt;yamabushi&lt;/i&gt; became associated with &lt;i&gt;tengu&lt;/i&gt;, mythical birdlike creatures that live deep in mountain forests. Hence, this print shows a pilgrim dressed in white carrying a portable shrine on his back that has been adorned with a &lt;i&gt;tengu&lt;/i&gt; mask, believed to offer talismanic protection.",
