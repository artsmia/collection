  "text": "The maiginu, literally \"dancing silk,\" is an outer robe for women's roles. It resembles ch≈çken, but it is longer, its side panels are sewn together, and it overlaps in front. It is worn belted at the waist to create blouson effect. This spectacular example is decorated with colorful phoenixes and clusters of paulownia leaves and blossoms. This auspicious combination originated in China, the former signifying a benevolent ruler and a well-ordered realm, the later serving as the bird's nesting place.",
