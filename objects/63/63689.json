  "text": "Chōken, literally \"long silk,\" is a type of unlined jacket made of semi-transparent, gauze silk fabric into which designs are woven or embroidered with gold-leafed and colored threads. The side seams are not sewn together, which allows it to swing and flutter as the actor dances. While chōken are used mainly for female roles, actors portraying noblemen can also wear them.",
