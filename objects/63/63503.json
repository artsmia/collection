  "text": "Founded in North China by semi-nomadic Khitans, the Liao dynasty (907-1125) produced a large number of superb gold and silver wares using traditional Chinese metalworking and gilding techniques. Unlike traditional Chinese burial customs, the Liao often used gold or gilt bronze funerary masks in burials of important individuals. It is thought these masks were portraits of the deceased. This superb life size example of a serenely elegant young woman is fully rounded and unusually well-finished. The flange below the chin is integral to the mask and, wrapped beneath silk clothing, it would have functioned to keep the mask in place.",
