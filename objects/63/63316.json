  "text": "Zøzu Mountain, in Sanuki Province (modern-day Kagawa Prefecture) is the location of Kotohira Shrine dedicated to the god of the sea. The shape of the mountain resembles an elephant's large round head in profile, hence the name Zøzu (literally \"elephant head\"). Kotohira Shrine was among the most popular destinations for pilgrims in the nineteenth century. Here, Hiroshige depicts a group of such travelers. One of the women in the foreground carries a walking stick to aid her in climbing the mountain to reach the shrine on its slope.",
