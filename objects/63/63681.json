  "text": "The stylized birds and berries here have more in common with New England folk art than with traditional fine quilts. Perhaps most unusual is the use of felt for the stuffed appliqué birds and berry sprigs.\r\n\r\nTypically, appliqué motifs are cut from woven fabrics, the edges are turned under to prevent raveling, and the piece is then stitched to the ground fabric. Because felt is matted and pressed, rather than woven, the edges do not ravel, and the quilter can skip turning them under. Very small, intricate design elements can be applied quickly and easily. Even so, making this quilt likely took hundreds of hours.",
