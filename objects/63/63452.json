  "text": "<I>Kariginu</I>, literally hunting robe was originally an informal jacket worn by noblemen during Japan's Heian era (794-1185). Later, elite warriors donned <I>kariginu</I> as their most formal garment. Since warrior-patrons expressed their appreciation for fine performances by presenting actors with articles from their own lavish wardrobes, it is likely that the first <I>kariginu</I> used on stage were originally worn by samurai-aristocrats. This robe is decorated with an overall pattern of octagons connected by smaller squares to the left, right, top, and bottom, a design the Japanese call <I>shokkō</I> (Shuchiang in Chinese), after a style favored in neighboring China during the Ming dynasty. <I>Kariginu</I> with the <I>shokkō</I>pattern are reserved for the most lofty of all Nō roles, that of the god-like Okina (divine old man) whose felicitous dance bestows happiness and prosperity on the community.",
