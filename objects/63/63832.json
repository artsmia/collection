  "text": "The highly skilled weavers of San Antonio Aguas Calientes, Guatemala, produce some of the finest, most complex, and most famous textiles in the region. They are known for their double-faced weaving technique, which produces identical patterns on both sides of the fabric. You can see this double-sided effect on the baby’s cap (6) and the woman’s ceremonial tzute, or woven cloth (3).\r\n\tIn this selection of weavings, you can find patterns that feature a combination of geometric, floral, and animal imagery. You can also see the influence of needlepoint and counted cross-stitch patterns that were brought to Guatemala from Spain in objects 1 and 2.",
