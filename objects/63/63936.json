  "text": "A longtime member of the printmaking faculty at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, Meeker was active at Atelier 17 in Paris in the 1950s. Meeker demonstrates his fascination with complex tonal and textured images and the expressive possibilities of technique in this hybrid color print, which combines collography and screenprinting. Though little used today, collography is a relief printing process in which physical objects, textural agents, glue, textiles, and other materials are attached to a rigid printing matrix. The collaged matrix is then inked and typically printed on an intaglio press. The process is most often used to achieve complex tonal and textured images. In this example, color is applied solely with use of screenprinting.",
