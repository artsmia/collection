  "text": "Italian painter and performance artist Michelangelo Pistoletto uses mirrored steel or acrylic surfaces as the ground for his photo-based figurative paintings and screenprints as a way to capture the ever-changing environments in which they are seen. For the mirror triptych Gemelle, Pistoletto presents his subject in a matched pair of profile images, each showing the sitter gazing inward toward a small dot at the midpoint of an otherwise empty mirror. The viewer also focuses on the dot, their reflection providing the work's third portrait. By bringing the viewer and the immediate environment into play, Pistoletto hoped his approach would emphasize the unity of art and life.",
