  "text": "Nuihaku, literally “sewn foil, ” refers to kosode (short-sleeved)-type kimono that is decorated with embroidery and pasted gold and silver foil. This garment is decorated with seasonal plants, including peonies, plum blossoms, willows, chrysanthemums, narcissuses, and maple leaves. Worn by male actors performing as women, it is normally mostly hidden under a larger karaori layer, which is lavishly decorated with colored, gold, and silver threads.",
