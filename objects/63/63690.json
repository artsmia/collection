This garment is decorated with seasonal plants, including peonies, plum blossoms, willows, chrysanthemums, narcissuses, and maple leaves. Worn by male actors performing as women, it is normally mostly hidden under a larger karaori layer, which is lavishly decorated with colored, gold, and silver threads.",
