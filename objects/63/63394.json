  "text": "Kondo_ Takahiro was born into a family of traditional blue-and-white porcelain artists. His grandfather, Kondo_ Yu_zo_, was recognized as a Living National Treasure for his innovative painterly style in applying cobalt to his ceramics. Takahiro, on the other hand, has not been stymied by the weight of his family's past accomplishments. While still working with porcelain and cobalt, he has recently devised a method of applying a metallic amalgam to the surface of his works to create the effect of water droplets.",
