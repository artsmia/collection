  "text": "Old low-budget Westerns—the once popular fare of Hollywood (and Italian) moviemaking—inspired David Rathman’s cowboy images. Rathman finds that their sometimes clichéd familiarity gives rise to whimsy, even humor, when combined with a pertinent phrase of dialogue inserted into the scene. Here, two riders on horseback silently part ways. The text above them—Butterfly Mornings, Wildflower Afternoons—is the title of a ballad sung by lovers Cable Hogue (Jason Robards) and Hildy (Stella Stevens) in Sam Peckinpah’s 1970 classic film The Ballad of Cable Hogue.",
