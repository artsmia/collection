  "text": "A new trend in bronze decoration emerged during the Warring States period that employed an inlay technique to depict livelier pictorial scenes or abstract designs. This precisely fashioned hu, made during this period of bronze casting, originally had its recessed geometric design inlaid with copper and turquoise. In general, inlaying involved inserting very thin gold, silver, or copper foil thread into a fine line scored on the surface of the bronze. It allowed artisans to create fantastic patterns and images. The technique of embellishing bronze, with turquoise, or more rarely malachite in the early period, occurred as early as the Erlitou culture. It was during the late Spring and Autumn and the Warring States periods, however, that the technique, now encompassing more gold and silver inlay, came into wider use, and the most refined vessels and accessories, such as belt hooks, were made.",
