  "text": "For this fan print, Hiroshige depicts the noblewoman Murasaki Shikibu (active ca.973-ca.1016), the author of Genji monogatari (Tale of Genji), one of the world's oldest-and Japan's most beloved-novels. It is said that lady Murasaki came up with the idea for her novel while viewing the harvest moon over Lake Biwa while staying at Ishiyamadera temple. Hiroshige exploited this episode as an autumn theme for his fan design.",
