  "text": "Waníyetu Wówapi, or winter counts, are pictographic calendars used predominantly by the Lakȟóta and other Plains nations. The “keeper” drew the image and was charged with recounting history to the community. Winter counts were recorded on animal hides but were sometimes transferred to muslin (a light cotton fabric) for different reasons: to preserve the record in cases of wear; because a new keeper took over the record; or because the keeper was commissioned to re-create it. This winter count was created or interpreted by Long Soldier, a Húnkpapȟa Lakȟóta chief who signed the 1868 Fort Laramie treaty. It offers a 106-year glimpse into his community’s history.",
