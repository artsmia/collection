  "text": "In 1833, a spectacular meteor shower occurred over the Plains. The event, recorded by Euro-Americans in newspapers and letters, is illustrated on a pictographic calendar called waniyetu wowapi, or “winter count,” on which Lakota people recorded their history. Tribal leaders and the keeper of the calendar agreed on an image to represent a single important event from each year—a falling sun and stars for “year the stars fell.” The keeper drew the images and was charged with recounting their stories as a way for tribal members to learn their collective history. Winter counts were recorded on animal hides but were sometimes transferred to cotton fabric—for preservation, when a new keeper took over, or on commission for non-Indians. This winter count, on muslin, covers 106 years (1798–1904) of a Lakota community’s history.",
