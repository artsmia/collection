  "text": "Located on the outskirts of the Edo (modern Tokyo), Ōji was an easily accessible resort town for city residents. The town had many scenic sites, such as rolling hills and rivers, as well as the wondrous waterscapes of its famous Seven Waterfalls, one of which is depicted here. The third shogun, Yoshimune (1684-1751), purposefully developed this area for tourism by planting cherry trees (for blossom viewing in spring), and maple trees (for picnics in autumn). As a result, Ōji became a popular destination all year around, and there were many restaurants and teahouses to serve tourists. In summer, when people visited the waterfalls to cool themselves, restaurateurs set tables outside, by the water, and served food and drink there. The rope hung before the waterfall is a shimenawa, a sacred rope that divides the human world from the sacred. In this case, it demarcates the sanctuary for the river god.",
