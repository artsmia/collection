  "text": "This bold, red headdress is of the type often referred to as \"coral snakes.\" Coral snakes are worn exclusively in the village of Tamah√∫. According to Mayan belief, snakes are harbingers of rain, often depicted in visual expression as long, zig-zag forms. In this way, snakes are equated with lightning, a symbol of life-giving rain and a link between the heavens and the earth. The color red is also synonymous with life. This headdress, worn close to a woman's head, signifies the east and the rising sun, blood, fire, and a woman's ability to create life.",
