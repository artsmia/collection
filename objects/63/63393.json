  "text": "Kyoto ceramist Miyashita Zenji trained under his potter father, Zenju, as well as the ceramic sculptor Kiyomizu Ku_bei at Kyoto Art University. He rapidly took the ceramic world by storm when he developed a new technique of layering thin bands of colored clay onto the surface of his vessels. Ranging in tone from dark to light, these irregular bands suggest distant hills, drifting clouds, or rolling waves.",
