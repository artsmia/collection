  "text": "After studying ceramics at Northern Michigan University, potter John Dix traveled to Greece and Jerusalem before settling in Japan in 1989, where he has remained since.  Dix creates traditional Japanese wares, such as sake cups and teapots, like the one shown here, that juxtapose contemporary elements with elements relating to the tea ceremony.  This teapot, for example, maintains the muted color palette of browns, greens and reds that are often seen in tea wares, giving the piece an organic feel.  Dix adds to the teapot contemporary influences as well, such as the architectural handle.  He blends West and East through his introduction of salt-firing, a method which has deep roots in the West but is used scarcely in Japan.",
