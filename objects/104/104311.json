  "text": "17-year old Jan Rose Kasmir stands with a chrysanthemum in her hand, facing the National Guard lined up to keep protesters away from the Pentagon, headquarters of the United States Department of Defense. Kasmir and others were protesting against the war in Vietnam. Kasmir later recalled that she realized at that moment how young these guards were. None of them made eye contact. But photographer Marc Riboud later told her that he noticed the guards shaking, perhaps afraid they were going to be told to fire at the protesters. Kasmir said, \"It wasn't until I saw the impact of this photograph that I realized it wasn't only momentary folly – I was standing for something important.\"",
