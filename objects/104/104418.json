  "text": "The Thar Desert is a vast arid region sprawling across Sindh, Pakistan into the Indian states of Rajasthan and Gujarat. Here, red is the traditional color of weddings, peacocks stand for bride grooms, and flowers are symbols of fertility and prosperity.  \r\n\r\nThis wedding veil fluently speaks the local language, although it uses a geometric accent closely associated with the Sodha Rajput community.  Rhomboid clusters are flowers, pyramided triangles are peacocks, and stacked chevrons are peacock tails.",
