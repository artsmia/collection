  "text": "Stacey Davidson creates marvelously expressive figural drawings modeled after character dolls of her own invention that she produces in her studio. She assigns each of her dolls a fictional persona based on gender, physical characteristics, and mode of dress. They serve as characters for her various portraits and narrative scenes, and in life, represent a full spectrum of human personalities.\r\n\r\nIn Germanic folklore, the scruffy character Knecht Ruprecht is one of several sinister companions to Saint Nicholas (Father Christmas). Traditionally portrayed as a servant, farmhand, or foundling, Ruprecht meted out punishments to misbehaving children that ranged from a lump of coal left in a stocking to beatings, kidnapping, and murder. For Davidson, Ruprecht is primarily menacing, yet capable of moments of tenderness. Here, he carries what appears to be a doll, but the scene is  ominous, given our knowledge of Ruprecht's cruel ways.",
