  "text": "The manufactured materials that are used in this moccasin cuff are the materials that are used in a lot of later art.  The cuff is an example of the transition from the use of natural materials to the use of manufactured materials.\r\n\r\n--Anthony White\r\n\r\n\r\nThis moccasin cuff is in its initial stages.
