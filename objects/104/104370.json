  "text": "Birch bark was the paper, plastic and aluminum to Anishinaabe people before these materials were so readily available. Anti-microbial properties in birch bark make it ideal for storing food or for archiving information. This type of box was often sold along the side of the road at souvenir stands. Now these are not as easy to find. \r\n\r\n--Andrea Carlson\r\n\r\n\r\nThe flower pattern on the lid of this box and the use of color is an example of the type of artwork that will follow with the introduction of manufactured materials.  The artist uses the edges of the quillwork design to suggest individual flower pedals.  The artist that did the quillwork on this box shows a clever use of line and space by incorporating the color of the birch bark to read as the outline of the rose pedals.\r\n\r\n--Anthony White",
