  "text": "Chalchiuhtlicue (Chal-chee-oot-LEE-kway), literally \"She of the Jade Skirt,\" is the Mexica (meh-SHEE-kah) goddess of water and the wife of rain god Tlaloc (TLAH-loak). She is identifiable by her distinctive wide headband with large tassels. Precious stone or shell was once inlaid into her eyes, the incisions in her cheeks, and the cavity in her chest. However, this sculpture assumes the pose characteristic of another important Mexica goddess. Her pose, standing with her hands extending outward as if she were holding something, is typical of the corn goddess Chicomecoatl (Chee-koh-may-KOH-atl). As Chicomecoatl, she would have likely held small ears of an ancient variety of corn, which are now lost. Both goddesses are associated with fertility. A sculpture like this one would have been the focal point of a shrine.",
