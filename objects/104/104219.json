  "text": "Theodore Eitel spent his entire life in Louisville, Kentucky, where he excelled at making pictures of trees and forests. He was part of the movement of American naturalistic photography, which took nature is its primarily subject and guiding aesthetic. Eitel liked to play foreground and background elements off one another, and paid particular attention to lighting condition. His work was rediscovered by the MIA in 2007 for an exhibition and we are the first museum to acquire photographs him.",
