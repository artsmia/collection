  "text": "This drinks pitcher is an important example of the Space Age movement in design of the 1950s.  Colflesh's design for the elegant <I>Circa '70</I> line not only suggests space flight and looks to the future, it also responds to the endeavors of Scandinavian companies to modernize their silver lines, such as Henning Koppel's iconic mid-century designs for Georg Jensen, which were becoming quite popular in the United States.  The refinement and quality of this piece is comparable to the best Scandinavian work of the period.",
