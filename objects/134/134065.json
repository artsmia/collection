  "text": "In 2006, following a police attack on a peaceful teachers’ strike, the Mexican state of Oaxaca saw a popular revolt that led to the occupation of Oaxaca City by the Popular Assembly of the People of Oaxaca, a coalition of teachers, workers, activists, and protesters that called for the removal of then-governor Ulises Ruiz Ortiz. The uprising included the occupation of the radio broadcast station Canal 9 by a group of women whose efforts were instrumental to the movement’s anti-capitalist, anti-hierarchical agenda. This illustrated account of events shows how comics have been used to document and disseminate instances of injustice and political action.",
