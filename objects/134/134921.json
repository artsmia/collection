  "text": "Compiled by artists and writers at the squat and artist cooperative Bullet Space, Your House Is Mine is a collection of texts and images concerning homelessness and lack of affordable housing in New York’s Lower East Side and East Village, two adjacent bohemian and immigrant neighborhoods in Lower Manhattan. After the 1988 Tompkins Square Park Riot, where police clashed with protesters in an attempt to evict people living in the park, Andrew Castrucci and Nadia Coën conceived this book and an accompanying street-poster campaign as an act of resistance against the city, its landlords, and police. It raised awareness of the socio-political issues facing their neighborhood and others around the world also experiencing gentrification, property speculation, and lack of investment.",
