  "text": "Activist Ronni Tartlet, who compiled and conducted interviews for this zine, describes the project on the inside cover: “For the last four months of 1999, I was lucky enough to be able to travel around the Middle East and Asia, mostly with my girl Ronica. We conducted lots of interviews along the way with activists of many kinds. The idea was to use our travels as an opportunity to educate ourselves and others about what’s going on in the world. I mean, what’s really going on, not the six o’clock news soundbite. And most of the major stuff, that actually affects people’s lives, doesn’t even get the soundbite…”",
