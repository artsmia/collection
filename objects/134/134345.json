  "text": "This zine is an illustrated transcription of a 1973 LP recording of a speech given by Fundi, a labor strike organizer and workers’ rights activist with first-hand experience with collective revolt in Jamaica. In direct opposition to the increasingly out-of-touch, bureaucratic sugar farming and meatpacking unions and bosses, Fundi distributed zine-like leaflets and organized spontaneous and autonomous actions that inspired workers to organize for better pay, safer working conditions, and paid maternal leave. The transcription of Fundi’s speech—which was exclusive to the LP until it was republished in this zine—is complemented with images of field and factory workers in Jamaica and Grenada, labor strikes, and American GIs standing conspicuously alongside Caribbean residents.",
