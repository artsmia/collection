  "text": "Fly’s zine PEOPS is a collection of portraits and stories of the people who she has met, many of whom are artists, performers, activists, and writers. Each page superimposes a sitter’s face over a crowded body of handwritten text that narrates their personal history offering candid insight into the sitter’s life, experiences, and memories. In Fly’s own words, “everyone deserves a voice, everyone deserves to be listened to.”",
