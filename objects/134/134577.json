  "text": "Slug & Lettuce (S&L) is a tabloid zine known for its scene reports, classifieds, and bulletins of contact information and resources in support of global DIY, punk, and anarchist networking. In addition to columns about veganism, urban gardening, and anti-authoritarian politics, each issue of S&L features Boarts’ original band photography paired with a section of punk art and reviews of music, concerts, and zines. Included as an insert to an issue of S&L, this xeroxed photo-collage of their photography resembles the crowded, fast moving nature of a punk show mosh pit, where concertgoers energetically dance and thrash about near the stage.",
