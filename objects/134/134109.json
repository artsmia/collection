  "text": "Helen’s Tits is a French fanzine for the queercore punk band God Is My Co-Pilot, who Fly toured with in the 1990s, singing vocals and playing bass. The zine includes interviews, essays, poetry, and art by the band’s fans, placing the zine in a subgenre known as fanzines. Fanzines help forge networks between artists, musicians, and fans by hosting a dedicated space for sharing interviews, concert experiences, and art with fans and band members alike.",
