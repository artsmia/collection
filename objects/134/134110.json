  "text": "Many punk zines include what is called a “scene report, ” an update on the state of the music, arts, and performance scene in a particular place. They are usually expressed through news, interviews, and reviews of LPs and zines, and are ways for bands to reach non-local, often international fans. This British-based zine features scene reports from the Czech Republic and the Philippines, focusing on the hardcore anarcho-punk and crustcore scenes there, two related subgenres of punk rock notable for their fast paced, industrial sound and do-it-yourself approach to community, fashion, recording, and distribution.",
