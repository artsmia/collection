  "text": "Made by a “southern queer anarcha-feminist young transgendered boy,” this zine explores the intersection of sexual power dynamics and political and gender theory. In this spread, the author (identified only as “Oliver”) relates larger ideas about patriarchy and violence to their personal sexual experiences. i see stars is part of a subgenre of zines known as perzines (short for personal zines), which are personal not only for the intimacy of their content but also because their handcrafted, self-distributed nature contributes to a direct and personal connection between maker and reader.",
