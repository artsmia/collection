  "text": "World War 3 Illustrated is a periodical comics anthology steeped in anarchist politics and its origins in 1980s punk and DIY culture. Each issue features work by its volunteer collective of artists, writers, and political activists, and is dedicated to a single theme—such as the 1992 Los Angeles riots, Reagan and mass incarceration, police brutality, political prisoners, and domestic abuse. The series uses the combined literary and visual elements of the comics medium for journalism and critical social and political commentary, exploring the ways that war-like oppression is ongoing both across the world and in our own neighborhoods and homes.",
