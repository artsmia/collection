  "text": "Japan’s first ceramic culture, the Jōmon (14, 000–300 bce), produced strongly tactile pottery over 3, 500 years ago. This lavishly decorated bowl was probably used during religious ceremonies. Its flamboyant rim, a typical feature of the middle period of Jōmon pottery, is known as the “fire-flame” type, because the coils of clay resemble leaping flames. The word <i>jōmon<i>, after which the historical period is named, means “cord markings” and derives from the distinctive patterns produced by rolling a rope-wrapped stick across the surface of the clay. The lower portion of this vessel bears these markings, together with whimsical designs carved into the surface of the clay.",
