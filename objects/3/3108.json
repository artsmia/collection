  "text": "This whimsical, decorative serving dish was designed to complement a meal featuring wild game. A staple of Victorian households, this type of ceramic vessel was known as majolica ware, characterized by a dynamic blend of exuberant modeling and rich color glazes. Modeled as the stump of a tree, this game dish features naturalistic ducks and foxes set against leaves and ferns; a mushroom finial completes the playful illusion. Tureens such as these were sold with detachable ceramic liners in which pigeon pie or similar dishes were prepared or cooked. The majolica dishes themselves were intended only as ornamental serving dishes.",
