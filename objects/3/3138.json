Finely painted with auspicious motifs in harmonious colors, the plate would have been a relatively standard decorative object in an upper-class Chinese household.\r\nFamille verte ware reached its height of popularity during the Kangxi reign when it was produced in great quantity for China's upper classes and for the European export market as well.",
