  "text": "Charles M. Russell was born in St. Louis, Missouri. Shortly after his 16th birthday, he left for Montana to pursue his lifelong dream of being a cowboy. He worked as a cowboy and wrangler for 11 years and documented his experiences through sketches, paintings, and modeled figures. Russell’s paintings reveal a deep admiration for Native Americans and especially the Plains peoples. His close observation of their traditional dress, weapons, and horses is apparent here in details that indicate these men are members of the Apsáalooke (Crow) tribe. The scene is likely a hunting or scouting party—whether actual or imagined is unknown.",
