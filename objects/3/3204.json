  "text": "Sent by God, the Christ Child floats in the air toward the Virgin Mary—who crosses her arms in acceptance—under the dove of the Holy Spirit. His incarnation in Mary’s womb is foretold by the archangel Gabriel, who has just entered on the left. Three reliefs decorate the walls: the creation of Eve; the Fall, when Adam and Eve disobey God by eating an apple from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil; and their subsequent expulsion from paradise. In fact, the Virgin Mary here stands as a “New Eve,” the Savior in her sinless womb, who has come to redeem humanity from Adam and Eve’s sin.",
