  "text": "The Beilby family is credited with introducing to England the process of enameling clear glass. Mary and her brother William were the most skilled Beilby enamelers. Their decoration varied from motifs of arms and armor to architectural ruins and rural landscapes framed in rococo flourishes, as on this goblet. The goblet’s enameled decoration and air-twist stem display the light, fluid quality of the rococo style.",
