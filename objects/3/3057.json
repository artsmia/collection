  "text": "This commode, or decorative chest of drawers, is a feast for the senses. Flowers decorate the center, while the panels on either side display flaming urns on half columns. Below, rendered in gold-covered bronze, smoke billows from an incense burner. Most likely the commode’s owner took the hint, complementing these visual references to smell with an actual pot pourri—a vessel containing sweet-smelling materials—on its marble top.",
