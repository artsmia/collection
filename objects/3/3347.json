  "text": "Frank Lloyd Wright created this easy chair for a house he designed in Peoria, Illinois for Francis W. Little.  This chair's back is adjustable, giving a bit more comfort to the user than most of Wright's rectilinear furniture.  Little became Wright's close friend and financial supporter.  \r\n\r\nA decade later, Wright built a second home for Little, overlooking Lake Minnetonka in Deephaven, Minnesota.  The home's hallway, as well as a model representing the house, are displayed in this gallery.\r\n\r\n[this needs to be cut to fit label stand]",
