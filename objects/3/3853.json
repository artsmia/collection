  "text": "During the Han dynasty, food became both abundant and varied. Even the common people enjoyed great improvements in their standard of living. Han tombs nearly always included storage jars (hu) full of cereals and wine for the afterlife. This large, lidded jar painted in red, white and purple pigments with spiral patterns can be seen as a less expensive substitute for the similarly decorated lacquer containers that likely inspired its decor.",
