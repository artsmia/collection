  "text": "Wright's tall-back chairs are his trademark furniture form of the Prairie School period.  This chair from the Francis Little house in Peoria, Illinois is unusual in having a solid, massive back of quartersawn oak, in sharp contrast to Wright's typical tall spindles.  It might have served as a hall chair originally, as hall chairs typically have solid wooden backs.\r\n\r\n[this needs to be cut to fit label stand]",
