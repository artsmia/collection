  "text": "Phillis Hurrell was the only child of an old aristocratic family from Devon, England. She sat for Joshua Reynolds when she was about sixteen years old. He shows her playing a lute, perhaps a sign of her talent as well as her faithfulness and sympathetic character. In 1766, four years after having her portrait painted, Phillis married Robert Froude. The marriage was brief. Froude died in 1770 while Phillis was pregnant with their fourth child. Phillis outlived her husband by sixty-six years, dying in 1836 at the age of ninety.",
