  "text": "Contemporary with the paintings of the imperial Mughal school, those from the courts of independent Muslim kingdoms in the Deccan region reached a perfection and stylistic synthesis all their own. Like many late Deccani paintings, this scene is set in a garden, complete with fountains, watercourses, a canopy, and a grand pavilion.\r\n\r\nIt is unclear what the court lady and her servant are doing. The work may represent a ragamala, an illustration inspired by classical melodies in which a characteristic of love or heroic behavior is personified. Ragamalas were popular themes in the Deccan during the eighteenth century, and this scene may portray a woman awaiting the sound or music of her lover.",
