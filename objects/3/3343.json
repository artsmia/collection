  "text": "Excellent workmanship, as well as an inscription on the base, indicate that this lobed box was made in the imperial workshop of the Qianlong Emperor (1736-95). A pair of phoenixes soar amongst flowering peonies on the top while dragons confront one another on the sides. This type of lacquer is termed tianqi (\"filled in\") and is quite distinct from the more common carved variety, often called tihong. The technique relies on the use of incised gold outlines for precise designs in combination with inlaid lacquer in various colors to produce the polychrome decor. Tianqi was especially popular during the 1500s and enjoyed newfound appreciation during Emperor Qianlong's reign.",
