  "text": "Excellent workmanship, as well as an inscription on the base, indicate that this lobed box was made in the imperial workshop of the Qianlong Emperor (1736-95). A pair of phoenixes soar amongst flowering peonies on the top while dragons confront one another on the sides. This type of lacquer is termed <I>tianqi</I> (filled in) and is quite distinct from the more common carved variety, often called <I>tihong</I>. The technique relies on the use of incised gold outlines for precise designs in combination with inlaid lacquer in various colors to produce the polychrome decor. <I>Tianqi</I> was especially popular during the 1500s and enjoyed newfound appreciation during Emperor Qianlong's reign.",
