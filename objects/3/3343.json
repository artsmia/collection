  "text": "This exceptionally fine lobed box and cover is decorated on the top with a pair of phoenixes in flight amongst flowering peonies. The sides shows confronting dragons on each of the six reserves, and the black lacquer base bears a six-character Qianlong inscription. The excellent workmanship as well as the inscription indicate this to be an imperial piece. This type of lacquer is termed tianchi (\"filled in\") and is quite distinct from the more common carved variety, often called cinnabar. Tianchi was especially popular during the sixteenth century. The other period of its finest production was during Emperor Qianlong's reign. The technique relies on the use of incised gold outlines for precise designs in combination with inlaid lacquer in various colors to produce the polychrome decor.",
