  "text": "The cover of this jar depicts sacred mountains populated with animals of Han mythology, mainly dragons, tigers and bears. Around the main register is a landscape scene with hunters on horseback pursuing wild animals. Lian jars were used to store small items, especially cosmetics. The mountain peaks seen here and on the bo shan lu censer are inspired by popular Daoism and its fixation on immortality.",
