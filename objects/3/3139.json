  "text": "Plain white wares are amongst the earliest of the Tz'u-chou type wares. Produced from the tenth through the twelfth centuries, undecorated utilitarian white wares have been found at nearly every known Tz'u-chou kiln site of this period. Pieces in the group are made of the basic materials of most Tz'u-chou type wares, a greyish clay body covered with a white slip under a transparent colorless glaze. Several of these vessels have been excavated at Chu-lu-hsien, Honan province.",
