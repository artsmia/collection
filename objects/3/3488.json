  "text": "Otto Prutscher was born in Vienna and studied under Josef Hoffmann at the Kunstgewerbeschule (Vienna School for Applied Art). He then worked as an architect, decorator, and designer for Hoffmann at the Wiener Werkstätte in Vienna as well as several other manufacturers. For the workshops he designed textiles, glass, leatherwork, metalwork, and furniture. Prutscher's glassware for the Wiener Werkstätte is characterized by the use of the cameo process, whereby a clear glass object is encased with a layer of colored glass. The colored glass is then selectively cut or polished away, revealing the clear glass underneath. Prutscher's glass designs employ the geometric motifs favored by Hoffmann, whose designs are also shown in this case.",
