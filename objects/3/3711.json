  "text": "The varied and inventive methods of decoration found in Qingbai wares of Song and Yuan (11th-14th century) testify to the ingenuity of the potters. This lidded meiping vase is entirely decorated with molded décor. The shoulder register is comprised of a continuous lotus blossom and leaf motif in low relief set against a wave pattern. The lower register displays only the stylized wave pattern. A horizontal meander band around the middle of the vessel separates the two registers. It is here where the top and bottom sections, which were separately made, are luted together. The lid is molded with a simple chrysanthemum blossom motif. Mold decoration was more quickly executed than hand carved décor and it greatly facilitated the mass manufacture of qing bai ware.",
