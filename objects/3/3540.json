A replica exists which went up for auction at Christie's, October 1990, which has a provenance since 1887. Many early bibliographies on Dou reference this painting, mistaking it for the [MIA] original.  The work arrived at Trafalgar through an \"English provincial sale\", with no other source information provided.\r\n\r\n",

  "text": "The hermit monk turns to nature as a refuge from the temptations of the world. In the silence of his cave, he holds a rosary and meditates on the holy text. His altar is decorated with objects of devotion—the crucifix—stands as a symbol of salvation, the extinguished candle, skull, and hourglass are reminders of the brevity of human life, while the small straw basket which holds the hermit’s items for survival, suggest the virtues of frugality.",
