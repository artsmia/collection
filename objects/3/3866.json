  "text": "Baule men weave on looms that utilize heddle pulleys to produce intricate textiles. Weavers often had their heddle pulleys decorated with fine, small scale carvings of animal or human heads and figures. The carvings have no ritual or sacred meaning. They are meant to be admired for their beauty and to attract attention to the loom and the weaver who usually works out of doors among the people of the village.",
