The masks evoke female ancestors, who are responsible for guarding the communityâ€™s fertility. They are represented as beautiful women with balanced features, filed teeth, and delicate scarifications on their cheeks and forehead. This example includes an elaborate hairstyle, consisting of hundreds of strands and knots, embellished with red camwood powder.",
