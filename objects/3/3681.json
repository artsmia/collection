  "text": "The technique of painted enamel (commonly called Canton enamel) was introduced to China from Europe during the late 17th century. By the early 18th century, it was perfected with sophisticated color schemes and delicate brushwork predominating in the best pieces. Painted enamel allows for greater detail and color nuances than does cloisonn√© enamel, with its outlined patterns and opaque colors. The process of firing the enamels to a metal base, however, is essentially the same in both techniques.",
