  "text": "The high-glaze tiles incorporated into this clock feature leaves and insects in the Japanese style, while the brass clock case’s form and feet are related to Chinese furniture. They reflect the popularity of Asian prints and decorative objects at this time in Europe and the United States. Tiles were also all the rage, as their easy maintenance appealed to the Victorian-era obsession with cleaning. Tiles had endless design potential and were used to decorate objects from fireplace surrounds to furniture.",
