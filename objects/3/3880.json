  "text": "The delicately simple stemware reflects Hoffmann's interest in beautiful, functional  objects. While many Arts and Crafts-era collectives, such as William Morris's in England, hoped to produce their wares in a way that kept them affordable for the working class, the Wiener Werkstätte artist colony Hoffmann founded was perhaps more realistic about the true cost of superior quality goods.  Hoffman believed, Since it is not possible to work for the whole market, we will concentrate on those who can afford it. Wiener Werkstätte training incorporated practical courses for making as well as designing objects, and promoted fine arts, architectural arts, and decorative arts as equally important components of a unified interior. \r\n\r\nThe Lobmeyr factory continues to produce this line of glassware.",
