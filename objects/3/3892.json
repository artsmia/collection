  "text": "The striking visual similarites between Neolithic Pan-Shan and Ancient Pueblo jars is remarkable. Both cultures have taken a globular earthenware vessel designed for storage of water or food and highly decorated them with pigmented slips. Each has central medallions carefully spaced around the surface. Intricate linear designs have been added leading the eye in a circular swirling path around the jars. The high level of craftsmanship and attention to detail in the painted patterns indicates that these were highly treasured possessions. Examples from both cultures have been found in burial sites. Time and geography have prevented either culture from influencing the other making the similarites even more intriguing.",
