  "text": "For many Aymara Indians living in the Andean Mountains of South America, the primary beauty of a cloth was the thread from which it was made.  Quality of the fiber, consistent diameter and the angle of the twist all play an important role in the final aesthetic.  Here the weaver has used a different angle of twist for the white threads which adds a subtle nuance favored by the culture.\r\n\r\nThe short length of this poncho indicates that it would have been worn by a man at a New Year's celebration or other festival.",
