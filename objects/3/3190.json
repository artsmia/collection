  "text": "The 18-karat gold dresser set to which this cologne bottle belongs is a product of the prevailing taste in the early 20th century interest in antiques.  Its simplified form and minimal decoration along the edges reflect contemporary interpretations of classical designs.  Various elements comprising this set were introduced and designed between 1904 and 1919.  Tiffany's Blue Book for 1914 advertised a sixteen-piece toilette set of 18-karat gold with a \"filet edge,\" which possibly describes this set.  While it was no longer available as a set in the 1918 Blue Book, its components were still available individually.\r\n\r\nThe monogram is that of  Albert Herman Lindeke, who along with his wife received the set as a golden anniversary gift from their children in 1919.",
