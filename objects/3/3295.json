  "text": "This high chest of drawers is an early and well conceived example of the Queen Anne style in American furniture.  Because of the sophistication of its proportions and the sensitive handling of the legs, it is likely that this high chest was made in Boston, which was the style center of the American colonies from the first settlement until the 1730s and 1740s.  The object also comes with a history of descent in the Kimbell family of Ipswich, Massachusetts.",
