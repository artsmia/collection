  "text": "This textile is an overskirt known as an aksu, which would have been worn similar to an apron over a full skirt or dress.  Although it is displayed vertically here to better see the decorative motifs, the garment was intended to be used horizontally, with the large, plain swath of dark fabric at one edge tucked into a belt.  Andean textiles are made to be seen on the body.  As the wearer moved, the patterns woven into this garment would have appeared in a more dynamic fashion.  Weavers of the Potolo region are particularly known for their vibrant animal designs, featuring birds, horses, cattle, cats, and mythical creatures.",
