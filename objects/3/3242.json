  "text": "The subject of a craze that has lasted for centuries, China’s signature blue-and-white porcelain resulted from a significant technical breakthrough during the 14th century. This pear-shaped bottle (ping) was made near the beginning of this tradition. Encircling the body of the vase is a spiky, three-clawed dragon painted in underglaze cobalt blue. To depict the dragon, cobalt blue designs were painted onto the white porcelain body and then bonded under a clear glaze.",
