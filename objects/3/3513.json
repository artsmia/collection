  "text": "Although blue-and-white patterns in ceramics are associated with China, Islamic potters were the first to use cobalt-blue decoration. When commercial ties to China were reestablished during the 1300s, fine ceramics imported from East Asia, particularly blue-and-white, became extremely popular and greatly affected subsequent Islamic styles. This outstanding example from the Safavid period is closely related to Chinese porcelains of the Ming dynasty (1368â€“1644). The foliate rim, tendril design of the cavetto (concave molding), animal motif in the center, and continuous scroll bands all loosely refer to Chinese motifs.",
