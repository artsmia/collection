  "text": "The painter of this elaborate water basin was just one of countless artists and craftsmen who found inspiration in prints, in this case, Marcantonio Raimondi's engraving Apollo and the Muses on Parnassus (c. 1517–20). It is worth noting that the maiolica painter was looking back three or four generations for source material, which he then distorted for his own purposes.",
