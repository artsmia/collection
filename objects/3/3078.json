  "text": "A wide variety of standard vase shapes were developed during the K'ang-hsi region and famille verte enamels were commonly used to decorate them. The designs here are relatively complex featuring reserve panels of small bird and flower scenes set against the richly brocaded grounds that cover nearly all of the vessel's surface. This overtly decorative style was especially popular in export ware sent to European markets.",
