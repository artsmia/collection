  "text": "Jizō is a bodhisattva, a divine being of infinite grace and compassion who postpones his own buddhahood in order to help people achieve enlightenment. Since the 900s, he has been portrayed as a young traveling monk who carries a pilgrim’s staff and a wish-granting jewel. He is popularly believed to assist those condemned to the torments of hell and the wayward souls of deceased children. This statue shows Jizō descending from the heavens, as suggested by the cloud bank that supports his lotus pedestal. The exquisite workmanship and extreme elegance of the figure, particularly the serene beauty of the face, are elements associated with the Kei school of sculptors active during the Kamakura period (1185–1336).",
