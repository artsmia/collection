  "text": "The paintings of Alessandro Magnasco present mysterious worlds—dark, moody landscapes in flickering light, populated by wild, expressive figures. Monks were a favored subject. Here they are scattered about a woodland grotto praying, in seeming anguish. Magnasco’s interest in fantasy combined with his raw, rapid handling of paint, was very forward-looking in the early 1700s.\r\n\r\nMagnasco often collaborated with the landscape painter Antonio Francesco Peruzzini, to whom the background of this painting has recently been attributed.",
