  "text": "Large power figures of the Songye people, communally owned and housed in a special structure, were invoked for general welfare and protection against illness, sorcery, and war. The three horns atop this figure’s head contain “magical” substances and enhance its mystical power. When impending danger was sensed, two men would carry the figure through the village to ward off evil, holding it with wooden poles passed under its armpits.",
