  "text": "Finely worked cut-pile embroideries are objects of great prestige in Kuba society. The production of these embroideries is a highly specialized collaborative effort between men and women. Kuba men set up the looms and weave the raffia cloth that provides the base for the decorative elements. The most prestigious form of decoration, cut-pile embroidery, is worked only by women who develop great skill at this time- and labor-intensive art form.\r\nThe finest cut-pile embroideries, as in these examples, combine a flat stem stitch with a tufted plush stitch, resulting in a distinct texture that enhances the overall design of the piece. Patterns used for embroidery are drawn from over 200 traditional designs which are also used for wood carving, basketry, and ceramics. Kuba artists do not replicate designs exactly, but rather use them as a basis for improvisational experimentation in surface ornamentation.",
