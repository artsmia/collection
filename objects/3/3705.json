  "text": "In 1894, the designer Louis Comfort Tiffany patented a process whereby hot glass was exposed to metallic fumes and oxides to create an iridescent surface. He named this glass Favrile from the Latin work faber, meaning artisan. Tiffany's Favrile glass was extremely popular internationally where it won honors at worlds fairs. Through Favrile glass, as well as through stained glass windows and lamps manufactured at his studios in New York, Tiffany played a seminal role in the promotion of art glass at the beginning of the twentieth century. \r\n\r\nTiffany is also credited with creating an American Art Nouveau style by employing stylized naturalistic forms and motifs in his work. In this vase, the rich colors of the glass are manipulated to suggest an elongated flower.",
