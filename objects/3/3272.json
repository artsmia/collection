  "text": "Delicate laces became the rage in the mid eighteenth century. Threatened by this new craze, the silk textile manufacturers developed new designs which incorporated lace patterns into the structure of the cloth and thus satisfied customers who would have redirected their purchasing dollars into the lace market. Weaving structures were also changed to create lighter-weight fabrics, which were more compatible with these new designs.",
