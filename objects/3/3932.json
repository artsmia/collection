  "text": "Double jaspe, in which both the warp and weft contain bands of jaspe figures, produces a dizzying juxtaposition of patterns that greatly tests the weaver's skill. In all ikat, precise alignment of the threads is essential to producing a sharply defined pattern area. Many weavers employ specialists who align the jaspe warp threads before weaving commences. The weaver alone can make adjustments in the weft patterns - a task that is made more challenging by the overlapping figures.",
