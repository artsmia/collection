  "text": "This charger, richly decorated with slip (liquid clay) and depicting a fiery-leaved tree, was intended to be hung on a wall to beautify a home rather than be used at the dinner table. The asymmetry, bold autumnal color palette, and thick “brushstrokes” exemplify Laeuger’s unique approach to depicting nature—he used the ceramic surface as his painter’s canvas. His swaying tree is echoed in the curving arcs along the plate’s outer edge.",
