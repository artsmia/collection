  "text": "Asante weavers produce luxurious, richly patterned silk garments that are generally worn only at formal or ceremonial gatherings such as weddings, funerals, or the enthronement of a chief. These cloths are popularly called 'Kente' cloth (from <I>kenten</I>, basket), a name given to them by 19th century traders that may refer to the basketweave effect of alternating stripe and pattern blocks. Within the Asante culture, however, a cloth such as this would be referred to as <I>Nsaduaso</I>, a cloth of high quality that a man of means might purchase. <I>Asasia</I> is the highest quality cloth but its use is restricted to the Asantehene and the royal family.<P>\r\nIn the past, these wrappers were worn only by rulers, chiefs, and individuals deemed to be of a high rank based on their political standing or their wealth. Currently, anyone with the financial means to do so may purchase a cloth. Kente cloth has become very popular and has been adopted as an important symbol of African identity far beyond the borders of Ghana. \r\n",
