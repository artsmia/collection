  "text": "The large, frontal, round eyes painted on this bowl represent the eyes of an owl. In the Nicoya-Guanacaste tradition, the owl held special ties to the Unknown, and was associated with the mysterious and sacred aspects of the afterlife. Owls, with their special nighttime vision, together with their ability to navigate long cavernous passageways, were seen as gifted creatures. The ancient Native cultures likened the owl's journey to the human journey into the afterlife, except that the owl was able to return. Because of this, owl imagery often signifies the role of spiritual messenger.",
