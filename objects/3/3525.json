  "text": "Trained as a lacquer artist, and therefore accustomed to adapting his designs to difficult formats, Zeshin painted twelve images in the attenuated tanzaku, or poem card format. Each leaf, rendered in Zeshin's precise, controlled manner, represents a month of the year. Here, on the right, he depicts the harvest moon of the eighth lunar month. The left leaf shows a scene from a festival held on September 9th of the lunar calendar (known as Cho_yo_ or Double Nine), which traditionally included viewing special displays of cultivated chrysanthemums.",
