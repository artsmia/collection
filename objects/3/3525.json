  "text": "Trained as a lacquer artist, and therefore accustomed to adapting his designs to difficult formats, Zeshin painted twelve images in the attenuated <I>tanzaku</I>, or poem card format. Each leaf, rendered in Zeshin's precise, controlled manner, represents a month of the year. Here, on the right, he depicts the harvest moon of the eighth lunar month. The left leaf shows a scene from a festival held on September 9th of the lunar calendar (known as <I>Cho_yo_</I> or Double Nine), which traditionally included viewing special displays of cultivated chrysanthemums.",
