  "text": "Large folding screens with pictorial decoration executed in colorful lacquer gained popularity during the Kang-hsi reign (1662-1722). Called \"Coromandel\" after the southeast coast of India where European traders mistakenly thought they originated, several of these spectacular screens were shipped to the west during the eighteenth century. Although screens of this size are not often depicted in Chinese paintings, many bear dated inscriptions indicating they were often commissioned as birthday presents or awarded as gifts of distraction to meritorious officials upon retirement. Like their hardwood counterparts and decorative wall hangings, these screens would have provided colorful backdrops to important ceremonial events and formal social gatherings.",
