  "text": "In Kuba society, the process of making textiles is as important as the finished textiles themselves. This elaborately decorated raffia skirt symbolizes concepts of cooperation, interdependency, and familial responsibilities. The embroidery of a woman’s skirt is usually a group effort, with several women within the lineage contributing one or more sections, so the work represents a wide variety of skill levels and artistic interpretations. The finished skirt was owned by a high-ranking woman of the lineage, who would wear it on ceremonial occasions, especially funerals.",
