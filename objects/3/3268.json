  "text": "In Kuba society, the process of making textiles is as important as the finished textiles themselves. Elaborately decorated raffia skirts, such as this one, symbolize concepts of cooperation, interdependency and familial responsibilities which are highly valued within Kuba culture.<P>\r\nIn most instances, the embroidery of a woman's skirt is a group effort, with several women within the clan contributing one or more sections. Therefore, the individual sections represent a variety of skill levels and aesthetic interpretations. The finished skirt is owned by the clan as a whole and confers attributes of prestige, wealth and abundance to all members of the group.",
