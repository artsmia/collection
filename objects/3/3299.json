  "text": "The noted English designer, William Morris, loved to use a double cloth structure to create interiors fabrics. The interlacing of two cloths during the weaving process could be used to create a sturdy and thus durable textile and also allowed the designer considerable freedom.\r\n\r\nMorris created this design in 1878. It was first produced in his workshop on Queen Square, London and later woven at Merton Abbey outside of the city. It proved popular as a furnishing fabric and was produced in three colorways.",
