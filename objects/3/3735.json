  "text": "This graceful bentwood chair with its compound curves evolved from the earlier Pretzel armchair of 1952 by George Nelson Associates, which in turn was inspired by Gebr√ºder Thonet's Model No. 9 bentwood chair from around 1904.  As a marketing strategy, Paul Goodman ascribed its design to Norman Cherner, a well-known American furniture designer of the period.  Goodman's company, Plycraft, was located outside of Boston.  After supplying the military with bentwood products during the war years, he parlayed the company's advanced molded plywood technology into the commercial market.  Plycraft manufactured both upholstered and non-upholstered variations until about 1970.",
