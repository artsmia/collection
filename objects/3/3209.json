  "text": "The French sculptor Jean-Guillaume Moitte spent two years in Rome, and this long, relief-like drawing reflects his study of ancient Roman art. In both format and subject it recalls a famous Roman wall painting, The Aldobrandini Wedding, dating from the time of Emperor Augustus and excavated in Rome in 1601. \r\n\r\nRepresented here from left to right are the stages of a young womanâ€™s initiation into carnal love. To the accompaniment of music, and led by a more knowing companion, she is carried by a faun toward the realm of lust. Then, startled and modestly covering her face and genitals, she is shown the phallus of a male herm. In the final scene, reclining now, she passionately kisses an aroused satyr.",
