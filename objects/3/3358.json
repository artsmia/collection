  "text": "In 1951, Armi Rattia founded the design firm Marimekko to introduce Finnish design to the world through fresh, modern textiles that highlight simplicity and functionality. The first designs, including this one, consisted mostly of striking abstract patterns. These textiles were multi-purpose, suitable for interiors, furnishings, and clothing. Tiiliskivi, a Finnish word for brick, shows how Marimekko’s designers drew inspiration even from simple building materials popular in Finland.",
