  "text": "Jack Lenor Larsen drew inspiration for this fabric from a piece created in France during the 1920s and had it woven at the same French textile mill. Larsen liked the pattern and basic structure of the original but instead used contemporary reds to create this dramatic, lush fabric for the 1990s. Since the early 1950s, Larsen, Inc. has been a prominent high end fabric producer.",
