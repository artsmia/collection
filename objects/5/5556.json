  "text": "<I>Tzedakah</I> (צדקה), meaning justice, righteousness, or charity, is one of the most honored practices within Jewish tradition. The purpose of giving charity is to remember those less-fortunate in times of celebration and remembrance, such as major holidays, weekly Sabbaths, weddings, and memorials. Tzedakah boxes, such as this, are often placed in homes, synagogues, and public locations so those who wish can give anonymously and charitably. The funds donated are then given to assist those in need. This inscription of this box mentions the funds being specifically used to aid orphans (יתומים) and the poor (ואביונים).",
