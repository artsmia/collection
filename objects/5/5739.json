  "text": "Wright initially created this chair design for the Hillside Home School, a private school run by his aunts, Nell and Jane Lloyd Jones. He later found appropriate uses for the sculptural slant-back design in several of his other interiors, ranging from the domestic and commercial to the ecclesiastical.  He included slightly modified versions in his own home and studio in Oak Park, Illinois; the Larkin Administration Building in Buffalo, New York; and Unity Temple in Oak Park.",
