  "text": "This stark interpretation of an African mask combines several recurrent themes in Brown's work. Brown has often sought to convey the primordial ritual strength found in African and other non-western art, and another of his long-time interests is graffiti. In his series of black paintings from the 1980s, of which this is one, he drew simplified motifs into a background of black paint.\r\n\r\nBrown also makes etchings, and in this painting he used a technique analogous to etching, gouging the lines out of the paint layer with a pointed instrument. The linear alterations reflect light, which the eye perceives as a two-dimensional pattern.",
