It is played by plucking the strings with the right hand while depressing the strings for tonal variations with the left hand.  Such musical instruments were often elaborately embellished with mother-of-pearl inlay.  This <I>kayagum</I> has designs of flying cranes, symbols of longevity, and other auspicious symbols.",
