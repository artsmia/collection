  "text": "Kayagum, a twelve string zither, is related to the Chinese ch'in and the Japanese koto.  It is played by plucking the strings with the right hand while depressing the strings for tonal variations with the left hand.  Such musical instruments were often elaborately embellished with mother-of-pearl inlay.  This kayagum has designs of flying cranes, symbols of longevity, and other auspicious symbols.",
