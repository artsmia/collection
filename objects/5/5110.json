  "text": "The iconography of this stone lintel is based on the <i>Matsyapurana</i>, a text from the 1400s that describes the monarchical divinity Vishnu holding a club, a wheel, a lotus, and a conch shell. His two consorts stand on either side: Lakshmi carries a lotus and Sarasvati holds a stringed musical instrument. Vishnu’s vehicle, the winged Garuda, appears behind him. At the top, Vishnu’s 10 incarnations are carved in low relief.",
