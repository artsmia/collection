  "text": "Apsaalooka parents provided many toys for their children. The nature of these gifts insured that when children became adults, they would be honorable members of the community.  Constructed like a full-size one and decorated with classic Apsaalooka designs, this miniature cradleboard has a small removable doll with buffalo hair. This piece and the doll may have been created to teach young children the importance of being a good parent.",
