  "text": "Opus anglicanum is an embroidery style that originated in England in the 11th century but became popular throughout Europe during the medieval period. It is characterized by the use of couched metallic threads combined with silk surface stitches. This type of embroidery was primarily used for religious purposes on copes, chasubles and altar frontals and was executed in professional workshops and by nuns in convents.\r\n\r\nThis image of St. John the Baptist was likely part of an orphery, an embroidered band on an ecclesiastical vestment or hanging. Medieval artists used a variety of iconographic conventions to clearly identify the individuals depicted on textiles, illuminated manuscripts, or paintings. John the Baptist was typically portrayed dressed in animal skins, holding a lamb with a nimbus and cross, symbolic of Christ, the lamb of God.",
