  "text": "In 1969, the New York Guild of Handweavers sponsored a juried exhibition of textiles employing counterchange patterning. Counterchange refers to a reciprocal design in which foreground and background have the same pattern and are of equal visual importance. It was a favorite format of the well-known Dutch printmaker M.C. Escher. Nobuko Kajitani, a Japanese weaver living in the United States, used a contemporary adaptation of the complex weaving technique called taqueté to create this decorative hanging.",
