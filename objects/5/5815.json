  "text": "While octagonal head-rests were common during the Song and Jin dynasties, this example is distinguished by the calligraphy, written with white slip, which is a relatively rare technique. The fronds forming the fourteen character poem are executed in brown slip with particularly elegant brushstrokes. The poetic inscription reads:\r\n\r\n<P><I>Spring drunkenness meets often with an\r\n<P>overflow of flowers;\r\n<P>Autumn chants face at length the\r\n<P>graceful beauty of the moon.</I>\r\n\r\n <P>Pillows were typically inscribed with popular ballads, Confucian sayings, and poems. The inscriptions can be as short as one or two characters and as long as over a hundred characters.",
