Each Asante adult had a personal stool which was also believed to embody the spiritual essence of the individual and was therefore of prime importance in their daily and ceremonial lives.\r\nThe other attendant is a soldier, symbol of the King's military power.  He carries a flintlock musket on his shoulder and a small cask of gu",
