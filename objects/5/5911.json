  "text": "Ewe weavers are allowed total freedom in the design of their cloths. Unconstrained by traditional patterns or color schemes, these weavers freely invent designs that are limited only by their imagination and technical skills.\r\n\r\nA distinguishing feature of Ewe cloth is the use of figurative motifs interspersed between blocks of colorful stripes. This cloth is particularly rich in imagery; birds, animals, human figures, and everyday objects alternate with geometric and abstract motifs. One unusual image is singled out for special treatment: a long white scepter shape is woven in one of the plain indigo sections near the center of the cloth. This figure may represent a ceremonial staff such as would be carried by a chief or his advisors.",
