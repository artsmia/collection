  "text": "Che Mingyu, also known as Yeyun (\"Wild Clouds\") was born in Changge, Henan province. A self-taught artist, he excelled in painting ink landscapes and figures. His style has much in common with the sixteenth century Zhe school painters like Jiang Song (early 16th century), Zhang Lu (about 1490-1563), and Wang Zhao (early 16th century). Like many Zhe school paintings, the large size and bold technique suggest that the scroll was designed to be hung in a reception room. \r\n\r\nIn a summer scene set along the river, two men moor their boat. One pulls a rope holding the boat firm against the current while his companion drives a stake around which to tie the mooring line.",
