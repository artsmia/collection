The table was published in Hope's 1807 Household Furniture and Interior Decoration, which illustrated his highly idiosyncratic neoclassical furniture.\r\n\r\nTwo paintings now in the Institute's collection once hung in Hope's galleries: Titian's The Temptation of Christ and Vasari's Six Tuscan Poets.",
