  "text": "Throughout the 20th century, considerable energy has been directed toward the possible artistic conflict of industrial production and individual, hand-made objects. Here the artist considers the issue visually, creating an aesthetic statement inspired by a gear unit, a common symbol of the industrial revolution. The fabric was hand-printed using individual screens for each of the colors needed to complete the design.",
