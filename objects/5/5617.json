  "text": "Aoki Shukuya was a pupil of Ike Taiga. After his teacher's death in 1776, Shukuya continued to live in Taiga's studio, copying his paintings and functioning as a connoisseur of Taiga's works. This painting closely reflects Taiga's style with its playful brushwork and whimsical landscape forms. The dry brush application of ink to convey the rough texture of rock, however, is Shukuya's own innovation.",
