  "text": "With its finely carved shell and carved (rather than lathe-turned) stiles, this chair would have been labor-intensive and hence, was most likely made for a wealthy household.  It is not surprising therefore, that this chair was once owned by Levi Lincoln, a prominent statesman who served as Governor of Massachusetts from 1808-1809.  His descendent, Mrs. Huntington Brown, brought the chair with her to Minneapolis in the early 20th century.\r\n\r\nRounded stiles are found on classical Chinese furniture (see the Ming dynasty armchairs on view in Gallery 218), which indicates the owner's taste for the oriental.  Nearly one hundred years after this chair was made, a later owner had its original wood finish enhanced with japanned decoration, so named for its resemblance to Japanese lacquer.",
