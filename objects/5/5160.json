  "text": "Prajnāpāramitā, the Goddess of Transcendent Wisdom, is a personification of a holy text by the same name. In Tantric Buddhism, Prajnāpāramitā is believed to be the mother of all buddhas. In Cambodia, where this sculpture was made, the identities of god and ruler blurred during the rule of King Jayavarman VII (r.1181–1215), who made Buddhism the official state religion. He identified his mother with Prajnāpāramitā and similarly represented himself as the Buddha, so that sculptures possessed a dual function of representing the divine and the ruler’s divine power.",
