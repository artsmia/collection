  "text": "Prajñāpāramitā, the goddess of transcendent wisdom, is a personification of a holy text by the same name. In Tantric Buddhism, Prajñāpāramitā is believed to be the mother of all Buddhas. She belongs to a form of Buddhism practiced in Cambodia and Nepal. In Cambodia, however, the identities of god and ruler blurred under King Jayavarman VII (r.1181–1215), who made Buddhism the official state religion. He identified his mother with Prajñāpāramitā and represented himself as the Buddha, so that sculptures possessed a dual function of representing the divine and the ruler’s divine power.",
