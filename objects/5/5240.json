The four-faced, twelve-armed god holds Dorje Phangmo in his arms while trampling on the Hindu deities Bhairava and Kalaratri, who represent ignorance and evil.\r\n\r\nThe image bears an imperial inscription dating it to the reign of the Yongle emperor of China (r. 1403–24). The emperor sought the services of Tibetan lamas, and missions to and from China involved the exchange of gifts, Buddhist images, and ritual objects.",
