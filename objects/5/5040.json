  "text": "This Pomo basket is so large that a small child could curl up comfortably within it. Distinct breaks in the design appear in each of the three main design fields. Called dau, or pathways, these designs signify many things. They can be woven into the basket as intentional imperfections to embody the humility of the artist in gratitude for her masterful skills. They may also act as a form of the artist’s signature. Basket weavers have knowledge of the best places to gather willow, sedge root, and redbud from their local environments to begin the arduous processing of materials before they sit down to weave. The redbud offers a mahogany hue to differentiate the weaving patterns. Sedge is flat and grasslike, while willow and redbud are stiffer and offer stronger support of the basket’s shape.",
