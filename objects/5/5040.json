  "text": "A small child could curl up comfortably in this enormous basket, which is also notable for its use of dau, or pathways—breaks in the design that can symbolize many different things. An artist might weave them into a basket as intentional imperfections, embodying her humility and gratitude for her masterful skills. They can also serve as a form of the artist’s signature.\r\n\r\nPomo basket weavers know the best local places to gather willow, sedge root, and redbud, the start of a long process of materials preparation that must happen before they can sit down to weave. Sedge is flat and grasslike, while willow and redbud are stiffer and offer stronger support of a basket’s shape. Redbud also has a mahogany hue that can help differentiate weaving patterns.",
