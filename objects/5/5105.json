  "text": "Richly decorated belt fasteners like this one ornamented the luxurious silk costumes worn during the Warring States period. This elaborately decorated hook has three crystal bosses set over comma-shaped spirals, with smaller green glass bosses interspersed between entwined dragons. On the larger end is a dragon head with inlaid glass on the forehead. Its large oval ears slant along the sides, and above them are horns, quite long and curving. A pair of smaller dragons wind around the crystals, their heads merging in an undulating form, their bodies curving alongside the large dragon. The long hook ends in a turned-back dragon head. The concave underside has been left ungilded and is inlaid with a scrolling design in silver wire.",
