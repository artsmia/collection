  "text": "In 1909 Louis Sullivan and George Grant Elmslie designed the Henry Babson residence, with Elmslie working extensively on all aspects of the house. When Babson wanted alterations around 1912, he entrusted them to Elmslie and his new partner, William Purcell. The two architects designed furniture for the house, including a tall-case clock, andirons, and this box chair with a small carved \"B\" on each side.\r\n\r\n[insert photo of Babson house porch w/chair here - NWAA photo]\r\n\r\n[this label needs to be cut to fit label stand]",
