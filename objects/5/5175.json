  "text": "In the early Joseon dynasty, Korean potters produced a type of ceramic known as <i>Buncheong</i> (literally translated as “powder-green”), so named because the glaze applied to these vessels was greenish in color. Decoration of Buncheong wares took many forms, including stamped and inlaid designs, as well as lively patterns carved in light slip applied to the surface. This vessel takes the shape of a bale of rice, which is a common sight in all East Asian countries during rice-harvesting season. Bottles such as this one were first thrown on the potter’s wheel, then turned on their sides for the application of the spout and foot",
