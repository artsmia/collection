  "text": "A close friend of the great Ming literatus, Dong Qichang (1555-1636), Chen Jiru(1558-1639) came from relatively humble family origins. Having obtained the <I>Xiu Cai</I> degree at twenty-eight, he shunned government service and lived the life of a reclusive literatus. Highly regarded in official and scholarly circles, his fame was based on his writing, art collecting, and refined lifestyle.\r\n<P>This sparse landscape makes pointed reference to the style and techniques of the great fourteenth-century master Ni Zan (1301-74). Ni's dry, delicate, personal brushwork had tremendous influence on later literati artists. The deliberate sparseness of his rarified compositions, spare use of ink, and dry texture strokes that defined his landscapes are clearly evident here in Chen's homage to the earlier scholar-painter.",
