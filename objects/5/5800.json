  "text": "Weaving technology used by urban Arab weavers was very sophisticated. A belt such as this, with its complicated and diverse patterning would probably have involved at least five specialists: a dyer to create the four warp colors, three coordinated weavers (one handling the weft thread and ground structure, and two developing the pattern), and a passementerie craftsperson to finish the braided warp ends and tassels.\r\n\r\nFine wool weaving was made throughout North Africa and generally this production was used regionally, but urban Arab silk weavers frequently produced specialized textiles for a variety of communities in quite diverse locations.",
