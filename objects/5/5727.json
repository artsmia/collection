  "text": "The women of the city of Gafsa and the surrounding oasis in central Tunisia have long been famous for their weaving skills. Traditionally they focused their attention on the production of household items ranging from tent fabrics and rugs to clothing and bedding. Several hundred years ago, however, commercial demand developed for these domestic products and many weavers began to specialize. One of the most prized items was the elaborately pattered ferrachiya, used to decorate a bed or serve as a blanket. This piece is a particularly fine example with its fine weave and classic arrangement of decorative motifs arranged in transverse bands within square or rectangular fields.",
