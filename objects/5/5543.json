  "text": "The gunstock war club was a common weapon among people from the Great Lakes and Woodlands regions. Its name is derived from its shape, as viewed from the side. Most clubs are larger than this one, with an average length of 25-30 inches. The five thunderbirds incised on the club symbolize the spiritual power of the natural world. Lightning radiates from the thunderbirds, shown as zigzagged lines. Ceremonial use is indicated by the club's small size, the decorative incisions and the remnants of applied red pigment.",
