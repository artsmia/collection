  "text": "Manufactured by Heal's Fabrics, Network represents elements of the Op Art movement in its pattern, design and color scheme.  Apart from bright, saturated colors, black and white was popular in Op Art painting and design--Barbara Brown's Spiral, on view in this show, utilizes black and white to bold effect.  Network does this more subtly, with the use of nested squares that draw in the viewer.  The lines creating the squares in Network vary in their relationship to one another; some are extremely close and others further apart, creating a rhythm within the pattern, and giving a sense of movement.",
