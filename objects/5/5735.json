  "text": "Manufactured by Heal's Fabrics, <I>Network</I> represents elements of the Op Art movement in its pattern, design and color scheme.  Apart from bright, saturated colors, black and white was popular in Op Art painting and design--Barbara Brown's <I>Spiral</I>, on view in this show, utilizes black and white to bold effect.  <I>Network</I> does this more subtly, with the use of nested squares that draw in the viewer.  The lines creating the squares in <I>Network</I> vary in their relationship to one another; some are extremely close and others further apart, creating a rhythm within the pattern, and giving a sense of movement.",
