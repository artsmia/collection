  "text": "The Jewish Diaspora has a long history in Ethiopia—all the way back to King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba (950 BCE), according to some traditions. Ethiopians who practice Judaism call themselves Beta Israel, “From the House of Israel.” This necklace features the Magen David (Star of David), one of the most universally recognized symbols of the Jewish faith. Many who wear the Star believe it offers good fortune and protection from evil spirits.",
