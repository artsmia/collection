  "text": "Chen Chun (who was also called Chen Daofu) was regarded by many as the Ming dynasty's best classic flower painter, but he was also a landscape painter and leading calligrapher. A member of the Suzhou Wu school and elite circle of Wen Zhengming (1470-1559), Chen was a follower of Shen Zhou (1427-1509), founder of the Wu school. Chen painted many flower studies; his best are virtuoso ink performances.\r\n\r\nChen signed this painting with the seal “Daofu,” an alternate name. The work also bears three collections seals of the Qianlong emperor (who reigned from 1736-1795). The inscription on the paper mount is by a relative of Puyi, the last emperor of China. Typical of laudatory colophons, it reads:\r\n\r\nBaiyang Shanren (Chen Chun) expressionistic\r\nflower paintings created a unique style\r\nThe patriarch of flower paintings in the Ming\r\nHis brushwork is sparing and graceful,\r\nsuccinct in form and rich in content;\r\nIts meaning goes beyond the imagery,\r\nthese are true masterpieces.\r\n\r\nSpring 1783",
