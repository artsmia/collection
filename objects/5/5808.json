  "text": "Identifiable by the diminutive figure of the Adi-Buddha Amitaba in the hair behind the crown, this image of Avalokitesvara (<I>Kuan-yin</I>) bears a six character Yung-lo mark on its base, dating it between 1403 and 1424. The exquisitely crafted statue has an outgoing smiling expression befitting the deity whose role it is to aid those sentient beings seeking enlightenment. The Tibetan style of this image underscores the strength of the interrelationship of the Chinese court and the Tibetan religion during the Yung-lo period. Missions between the court and Lamaist Tibet during the Yuan dynasty (1280-1368) sponsored cultural exchange that led to this refined art form during early Ming. This image was created in the imperial workshops of the Forbidden City in Peking,",
