  "text": "John McQueen initially trained as a sculptor, but became a self-taught basket maker, using found natural materials to explore the concept of basketry in new ways; an example is also shown in this gallery.  With the installation piece <I>ADRAW</I>, McQueen has returned to sculpture using the same natural materials that he employs in his baskets, here sticks and vines.  He describes the piece as a kind of  literary drawing .  The word <I>ADRAW</I> overtly references the act of drawing in this unconventional medium, but it also is meant to reference a landscape that includes a river valley.  When observed up close, the individual letters disappear within the overall form, but from a distance, the letters are revealed in the negative spaces, along with the words atop, proclaiming You can never step in the same river twice.",
