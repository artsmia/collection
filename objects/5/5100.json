  "text": "John McQueen initially trained as a sculptor, but became a self-taught basket maker, using found natural materials to explore the concept of basketry in new ways; an example is also shown in this gallery.  With the installation piece ADRAW, McQueen has returned to sculpture using the same natural materials that he employs in his baskets, here sticks and vines.  He describes the piece as a kind of  \"literary drawing\" .  The word ADRAW overtly references the act of drawing in this unconventional medium, but it also is meant to reference a landscape that includes a river valley.  When observed up close, the individual letters disappear within the overall form, but from a distance, the letters are revealed in the negative spaces, along with the words atop, proclaiming \"You can never step in the same river twice.\"",
