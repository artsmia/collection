  "text": "Thomas Ona Ondulate was a trained Yoruba sculptor who also created work to sell to Europeans. \r\n\r\nThis figure of a British colonial district officer on tour combines a sure carving style with gentle irony. While Europeans often thought that they were being caricatured, the artist said that \"he was simply representing the world as he saw it.\"",
