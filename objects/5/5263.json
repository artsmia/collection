  "text": "Known best for her skillfully executed multi-figure sets, Josefina Aguilar applies her talents to a group of animals in this portrayal of Noah's Ark.  Like her human figures, each animal has its own unique distinguishing characteristics, generally expressed here through facial details and variations of posture.  Notably, in addition to the more usual creatures traditionally associated with the Ark, such as giraffes, elephants and lions, Aguilar has also included animals native to the Americas, like turkeys.  The reflection of her own inspiration and individual perspective in her work is a significant facet of its appeal and enduring interest.",
