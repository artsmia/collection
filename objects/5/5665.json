  "text": "This is a section of an organ screen panel from the Western Springs Congregational Church in Western Springs, Illinois. While the church is a fairly traditional ecclesiastical design, the musical notes of this sawed wood screen fragment have the playful spirit of Elmslie's Prairie School designs. It was probably removed during remodeling in the 1950s.\r\n\r\n[Insert photo of church interior here - NWAA photo]",
