  "text": "The lotus, the pure and sacred flower of Buddhism, was a popular motif on export porcelain during the mid-18th century.  The lotus pattern was originally made for the Persian market, but later shipped to Europe in quantity after a cargo had been captured between China and the Persian Gulf.  The New York Historical Society's collection includes a large lotus pattern punch bowl that was owned in New Jersey in the 18th century.  It belonged to Isaac Gouverneur and was described by his friend Washington Irving in Salmagundi.",
