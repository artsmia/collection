  "text": "Easy to sit in, versatile and less formal than armchairs, side chairs are often depicted in Ming period book illustrations. Made in sets and kept against the walls throughout the house until needed, like stools they were light enough to be easily moved into position for informal dining, work, or leisure activities.\r\nThe base of this elegant chair is close in construction and proportions to a standard rectangular waisted stool. The back stiles are merely extensions of the rear legs with a simple yoke top and center split completing the back support.",
