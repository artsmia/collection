  "text": "This light fixture came from the Minnesota Phonograph Company, an Edison dealership at 612 Nicollet Avenue, in Minneapolis, owned by Lawrence H. Lucker. Several such lamps were mounted on top of wooden grille screens in the shop. The rectilinear shape, stained glass, and horizontal wood banding linked the lamps to the surrounding architecture and furniture. Ironically, the phonograph cabinets themselves looked very old-fashioned in their modern setting.\r\n\r\n[insert photo of interior of Minnesota Phonograph Company here - from NWAA]",
