  "text": "As a youth, Philip Barber paid a $25 fine for scribbling on the cover of a library book. Although he has since been more mindful of his selections, he continues to adulterate the covers of books that he salvages from second-hand shops. The tactile quality of book covers as well as the patina of loving use by previous owners, are compelling elements for Barber. His additions are sensitive reactions to the pre-existing nature of the covers, transforming them into unique objects in which the artist's hand and the original merge into a cohesive whole.",
