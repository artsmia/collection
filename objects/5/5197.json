  "text": "This painting depicts a group of five scholars enjoying a game of go in an outdoor setting. It was a Confucian tradition that scholars be embodiments of moral, intellectual, and artistic perfection. The ancient board games of go (<I>weiqi</I>), Chinese chess (<I>xiangqi</I>), and double sixes (<I>liubo</I>) symbolized this valued trait of intellectual refinement. Four of the participants are seated on stools. The empty drum stool to the left is probably carved from white marble, a material common in outdoor furniture. The large round stool in the center has five fancy legs and is cushioned for comfort while the scholar seated to the right is on a very low wooden seat possibly indicating his lower status.",
