  "text": "Five Tang dynasty (618–907) scholars enjoy a game of go (<i>weiqi</i>) in an outdoor setting. Along with the other ancient board games of Chinese chess (<i>xiangqi</i>) and double sixes (<i>liubo</i>), go symbolized intellectual refinement, an essential trait of any Confucian scholar. The scholar at far right sits on a very low wooden seat, possibly indicating his lower status.\r\nGo was one of the “four arts” (<i>siyi</i>) required of Chinese scholars, which also included mastery of the zither (<i>qin</i>), calligraphy (<i>shu</i>), and painting (<i>hua</i>). This painting was probably one of a set of four, each depicting one of the four arts.",
