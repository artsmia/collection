  "text": "This painting depicts a group of five scholars enjoying a game of go in an outdoor setting. It was a Confucian tradition that scholars be embodiments of moral, intellectual, and artistic perfection. The ancient board games of go (weiqi), Chinese chess (xiangqi), and double sixes (liubo) symbolized this valued trait of intellectual refinement. Four of the participants are seated on stools. The empty drum stool to the left is probably carved from white marble, a material common in outdoor furniture. The large round stool in the center has five fancy legs and is cushioned for comfort while the scholar seated to the right is on a very low wooden seat possibly indicating his lower status.",
