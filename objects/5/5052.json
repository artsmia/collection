  "text": "Zhang Ruitu, one of the best Ming calligraphers, was a highly respected painter and one-time grand secretary. He received his <I>Juren</I> degree in 1603 and, in 1607, placed third in the palace examinations and became a compiler in the Han Lin Academy. He served the court as vice-minister of rites and eventually in the secretariat. In this handscroll, Zhang has written three poems from a sequence of eight entitled <I>Qiu Xing</I> (<I>Autumn Meditations</I>), composed in 766 by the eminent Tang poet Du Fu. Writing in running cursive script (<I>Xing Cao</I>), Zhang exhibited wide variation in the size and components of his characters and used exceptionally rhythmic brush pressure and fluent connecting strokes. His highly expressive characters approach the abstract.",
