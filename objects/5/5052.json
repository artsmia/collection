  "text": "Zhang Ruitu, one of the best Ming calligraphers, was a highly respected painter and one-time grand secretary. He received his Juren degree in 1603 and, in 1607, placed third in the palace examinations and became a compiler in the Han Lin Academy. He served the court as vice-minister of rites and eventually in the secretariat. In this handscroll, Zhang has written three poems from a sequence of eight entitled Qiu Xing (Autumn Meditations), composed in 766 by the eminent Tang poet Du Fu. Writing in running cursive script (Xing Cao), Zhang exhibited wide variation in the size and components of his characters and used exceptionally rhythmic brush pressure and fluent connecting strokes. His highly expressive characters approach the abstract.",
