  "text": "Chests made for the storage of small objects are known in a variety of forms. This type of box has traditionally been called a seal chest, suggesting its suitability as a storage cabinet for brushes, ink, seals and other scholar's objects. Excavated examples however, demonstrate that similar drawered cabinets were used for cosmetics, clothing and Buddhist relics. As such, they would have been useful in both the study and the bedroom.",
