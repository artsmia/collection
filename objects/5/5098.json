  "text": "Carved from bamboo, this perforated cylinder held sticks of aromatic wood and functioned as an incense burner or perfumer. It displays a delicately carved group of literati with attendants in a pine and bamboo grove listening to <I>qin</I> music. Although bamboo and wood had been used in China since antiquity for functional items, their use for finely crafted decorative objects began only in the Ming dynasty (1368-1644). The literati attraction to bamboo resulted, in part, out of their deep interest in bamboo painting. The plant's tremendous strength and ability to bend without breaking was seen as virtuous and likened to the disciplined character and integrity of the scholar. With its Confucian overtones and subtle, monochromatic color, bamboo became a favored material for literati accoutrements during the Ming and Qing dynasties..",
