  "text": "Amongst the tallest recorded yokeback armchairs, this pair demonstrates excellent proportions and exceptionally dynamic and vigorous lines. Tall armchairs were reserved for the most important members of a household and were commonly used in formal gatherings. In spite of their apparent rigidity, well-made yokeback chairs are ergonomically sound with rounded armrests, flexible seating and a contoured back splat which support the body with relative comfort.",
