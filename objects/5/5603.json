  "text": "Among the Plains Indians, it was often the grandmother's responsibility to construct a child's first doll. The materials ranged from as basic as a carved stick and buckskin to highly decorated beaded leather.  It was common to see Plains Indian girls carrying dolls in miniature cradleboards on their backs, learning traditional female roles from their mothers. This particular doll was probably not used for play but rather for show.",
