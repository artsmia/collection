Each panel is decorated with one of the five dhyani bodhisattvas including from left to right: Ratnasambhava, Akshobhya, Samantabhadra, the bodhisattva Amityeus and Vishvapani. Above each figure is a roundel bearing a sacred emblem such as three jewels, crossed vajras, the wheel of the law, the lotus and a sword. It is believed that when wearing such a crown, a priest is connected with the divine essence and becomes himself a receptacle for cosmic forces.",
