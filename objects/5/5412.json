  "text": "Tantric practitioners rely on sacred manuscripts to impart the teachings of a deity. In this case, the manuscript, which is a philosophical work on the nature of <I>prajna</I> (wisdom), includes the representation of the deity Prajnaparamita, who personifies the text. She is depicted in the center of the elaborately carved wooden cover holding a book and <I>vajra</I> (thunderbolt) in her upper hands, flanked by Green Tārā on her left and Avalokiteshvara on her right. The manuscript would have been protected by two wooden covers and wrapped in cloth. Considered to be a divine object, it was worshipped with flowers, incense, and unguents, much like the worship of a deity in a shrine. Practitioners believe that the book itself possesses sacred power.",
