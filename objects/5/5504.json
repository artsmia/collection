  "text": "Fashioned with an elegant raised foliate rim, this dish or stand is set on a high circular foot. The well is carved in the center with the long character meaning dragon. Song lacquers are characterized by smooth surface well-proportioned functional shapes and restrained decoration. Although most excavated Song lacquer comes from the South, the shape of this example with its foliate rim has much in common with porcelain of the North especially ting ware.",
