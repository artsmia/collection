  "text": "Peter Phillips' Spectroscope derives its name from a scientific instrument that breaks a single beam of light into a spectrum of colors.  Spectroscope spans a color range from an earthy brown to a bright fuchsia, again showing what complex color combinations were possible in printed textiles during this time, and mimicking the results of a scientific process.  The areas of color are separated into columns, which fade to rows of black, impeding the viewer's ability to focus on the pattern.",
