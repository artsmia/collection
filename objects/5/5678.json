  "text": "Ethiopia became the first African nation to adopt Christianity when King Ezana made it the state religion in the early 4th century. Crosses are among the best-known items of Christian Ethiopian art; nowhere else are there as many different styles. These three brass examples from the 15th century would have been mounted on long wooden poles and carried during processions. The cross on the left is engraved with images of the Virgin and Child flanked by the archangels Michael and Gabriel, with the 12 apostles on the back side.",
