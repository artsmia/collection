  "text": "An engraved and gilded mark on the base of this tabletop cosmetic cabinet tells us that it is a product of the official workshops of the Jiajing era of the Ming dynasty, dating it to the mid-1500s. This box presents a richly orchestrated scheme of symbolic plants and animals. The cartouches on the top and sides display the auspicious phoenix and cranes amongst clouds. Symbols of long life appear as well—the <I>shou</I> (longevity) character, <I>lingzhi</I> fungus, and peaches—as do the three friends of winter (pine, bamboo, plum tree), which represent perseverance and virtue.",
