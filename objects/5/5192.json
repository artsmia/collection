  "text": "An engraved and gilded mark on the base of this tabletop cosmetic cabinet tells us that it is a product of the official workshops of the Jiajing era of the Ming dynasty, dating it to the mid-1500s. This box presents a richly orchestrated scheme of symbolic plants and animals. The cartouches on the top and sides display the auspicious phoenix and cranes amongst clouds. Symbols of long life appear as well—the shou (longevity) character, lingzhi fungus, and peaches—as do the \"three friends of winter\" (pine, bamboo, plum tree), which represent perseverance and virtue.",
