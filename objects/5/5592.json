  "text": "Even fashion fabrics such as these chiffon velvets responded to the aesthetic inclination toward the linear graphic. These fabrics are deceptive, for despite the bold graphic design they are lightweight and drape beautifully.\r\n\r\nOriginally this was a solid velvet fabric. The pattern was then printed with an acid which dissolved the rayon velvet pile in selected area. This type of velvet cloth was developed by the French who called it devoré, to devour.",
