  "text": "Imagine this urn full of natural grasses, ferns, and other native Midwestern plants, prominently displayed in a home. Frank Lloyd Wright often celebrated local plants by bringing them inside, literally grounding a house to its site and blurring the border between indoors and outdoors. Created from molded and hand-hammered copper panels joined together, this spherical urn repeats the simple geometric forms in its circle-in-square decoration. The painterly cherry-red patina, or surface treatment, softens the strong form and would have complemented the natural colors of the plants",
