  "text": "Every high-ranking dignitary in the Benin kingdom owns a sword like this, even today, but not for smiting enemies. The eben sword, with its fanlike blade and hooped handle, is purely ceremonial. During an annual festival to honor ancestors, particularly those of the king, all the dignitaries dance with their eben, tossing and twirling it in the air before touching it to an ancestral shrine.
