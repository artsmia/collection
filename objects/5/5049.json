  "text": "The Yangzhou artist, Xu Bin, was not prolific, and little is known about his life and work. In typical scholarly fashion, Xu made reference to a past literati master in his signature colophon, which reads “in the brush manner of Su Shi (1031–1101)\". To the right of the composition, he also composed a rather arcane poem about bamboo: Flute making material; cut it, and give it to the dragon’s son. New shoots, stored up to nourish the phoenix’s grandson. When the Yugong [a book] described Yangzhou and its products It was only appropriate that it regarded its bamboo as beautiful as jade. Dedicated to Ma Bujiang Above the image is a short-running couplet, dated the eighth day of the fifth (summer) month of 1735. Xu said, “Because of the rain I sat at my window with nothing to do; and had the idea of writing these two lines with some extra ink”: Stone roots irregular as clouds; [reference to a type of desk or garden rock called a cloud root] Phoenix tails as delicate as jade. [reference to type of bamboo]",
