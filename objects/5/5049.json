  "text": "The Yangzhou artist Xu Bin was not prolific, and little is known about his life and work. In typical scholarly fashion, Xu made reference to a past literati master in his signature colophon, which reads “in the brush manner of Su Shi (1031–1101)\". To the right of the composition, he also composed a rather arcane poem about bamboo:\r\n\r\nFlute making material; cut it, and give it to the dragon’s son.\r\nNew shoots, stored up to nourish the phoenix’s grandson.\r\nWhen the Yugong [a book] described Yangzhou and its products\r\nIt was only appropriate that it regarded its bamboo as beautiful as jade.\r\n\r\nDedicated to Ma Bujiang\r\n\r\nAbove the image is a short-running couplet, dated the eighth day of the fifth (summer) month of 1735. Xu said, “Because of the rain I sat at my window with nothing to do; and had the idea of writing these two lines with some extra ink”:\r\n\r\nStone roots irregular as clouds;\r\n[reference to a type of desk or garden rock called a cloud root]\r\nPhoenix tails as delicate as jade.\r\n[reference to a type of bamboo]",
