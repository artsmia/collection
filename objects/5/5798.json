  "text": "Originating as a Daoist deity associated with the constellation Ursa Major, Kui Xing (also called Wen Chang and Wen Di) is worshipped in the third and eighth months as the God of Literature and patron saint of scholars. The surly-looking divinity is represented holding a brush in his right hand while standing on the head of a large fish becoming a dragon. The transformation of a carp into a dragon was a synonym for the literary success of an industrious student. This image holds a cap won by the chief graduate in his left hand while balancing a brushwasher on the heel of his upturned foot. Within Confucian society, scholarship could be the main determinant of one's rank and social status. The Chinese evolved a variety of so-called household gods to help them attain wealth, health, long life, and martial prowess. Statues representing the god of literature would have been owned by all manner of literary persons: students, calligraphers, government officials, and writers.",
