  "text": "This type of scepter was made by the Portuguese as a diplomatic gift, given to paramount chiefs in the Kongo region to win their favor. The blade is similar to those made from wood by the Woyo and Kakongo peoples for themselves. The symbols carved on the edge, the holes cut through the blade, and the snake incised on its surface identify the chief and important clan members while also representing proverbs about power, authority, and good governance.",
