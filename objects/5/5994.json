  "text": "From the founding of the Joseon dynasty at the end of the 1300s, Korean potters produced finely crafted, undecorated white porcelain wares that reflected the austere tastes associated with Confucianism, the official ideology of the Joseon rulers. King Sejong (1397â€“1450) is said to have been served only from pure white vessels. This flask, from the 1600s, was used to decant liquor. Potters produced such flasks by throwing two platelike shapes on the wheel, and then joining them together, rim to rim. Afterward, they attached a spout and foot ring. The very thinly applied celadon glaze allows the brightness of the porcelain to show through. Only in areas where the glaze is thicker can we see its cool, greenish-blue hue.",
