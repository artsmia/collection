  "text": "By the middle Ming, the influential literati painting movement known as the Wu school had developed in Suchou. Its spiritual founders, Shen Chou (1427-1509) and Wen Cheng-ming, represented a new generation of scholar-recluse. The theme of this painting and its accompanying calligraphy is based on the exploits of the legendary King Yu (d. 2197 BCE) who stemmed floods at Wu-ling in Shansi and became the first emperor of the Hsia dynasty. The site was later visited by Confucius (551-479 BCE) whose experience there was recorded by Chuang Tzu. Wen begins his own long poem here with the opening line of the ancient account written by Chuang Tzu.\r\n\r\n<P>Lu-liang, however, was in T'ung-shan county, Kiangsu province, near Wen's home in Suchou. Here the river is wide and unthreatening. Isolated houses, tiny hamlets, villages, and a walled town are all visible from the high vantage point chosen by the artist. Painted in his eightieth year, the landscape portrait probably commemorates a trip to the region or  place of residence of the recipient of the work.\r\n\r\n<P>Defining the highest scholar-culture traditions of sixteenth -century China, Wen Cheng-ming abandoned an official career to devote his life to literary composition, calligraphy, and painting. The calligraphic section of this long scroll is the best expression of Wen's brilliance. His brush moves across the paper with a swift fluidity instilling a sense of natural spontaneity.\r\n\r\n<P>Calligraphy\r\n<P>(Partial Translation)\r\n\r\n<P><I>The water's fall at Lu-liang is 24, 000 feet--\r\n        <P>this I had heard of old but today now believe;\r\n<P>From the east it is said, appears water from the high Yellow River.\r\n<P>Downstream it flows, continuing directly to the precipice at P'eng Gate.\r\n<P>Green mountains restrain the flow, between two steep banks, raging froth\r\n       <P>sprinkles the air, thunder as from a thousand cannons\r\n<P>Riding the wind I trace its source, which appears beyond the mountains\r\n<P>But responding to extraordinary views, my mind and emotions are moved.\r\n<P>As we descend from the clouds, my longing for youth is enough to excite me;\r\n<P>As the sun sets in the west, I lodge for the night in P'eng City.\r\n<P>From ten thousand li the spring wind freshens my short hair.</I>\r\n\r\n<P><I>Cheng-ming</I>",
