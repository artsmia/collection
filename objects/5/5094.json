  "text": "Elegantly posed with jeweled festoons suspended from his belt, pendant ear ornaments, and an elaborately domed hair arrangement (jatamukata), Shiva, the Hindu god of destruction and regeneration, is shown flanked by worshipful celestial couples. Shivaâ€™s dynamic triple-bend pose, called tribhanga, is inextricably related to the prescribed motions of body, limbs, and hand gestures of classical Indian dance. While acutely aware of human anatomy, South Asian sculptors rarely indicated musculature, concerning themselves instead with the portrayal of a flawless, divine body. A sense of the divine is masterfully achieved through intensely idealized beauty that has no mundane human references. This statue is probably from the exterior wall of a temple dedicated to Shiva.",
