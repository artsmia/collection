  "text": "Along river banks receding into the far distance are arrayed huts, pavilions and houses typical of rural life. Elegantly drawn trees arranged in stately groves diminish in size from foreground to background while clouds and mist obscure the distant mountains. The vertical composition, carefully delineated trees and rocks and aerial perspective are based on the classic landscapes of the eleventh and twelfth century masters. \r\n\r\nBorn in Suzhou in Jiangsu province, Wang Luo developed a style close to this contemporary Wang Hui, the famous orthodox master well-known for his reinterpretation of past landscape masters. \r\n\r\nThe inscription reads: \r\n\r\nMoonlight on River Village. \r\n\r\nDuring the twelfth lunar month of the year 1712 painted after the poetic conception of old man Huanhu, Wang Luo.",
