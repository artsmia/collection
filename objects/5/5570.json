  "text": "This simple, elegant screen served as a shield from fireplace heat. William Arthur Smith Benson favored minimalism in metalwork and used machine production to achieve it. Here, petal-like sheets of rolled copper, bent slightly to create an octagonal design, are attached to a brass pole. The shape suggests a ship’s propeller—further evidence of Benson’s keen interest in machines.",
