  "text": "In this work, a Daoist magician stands on a bluff by a pond, with a small boy at his side. The bamboo stick he throws into the air is being transformed into a dragon. This illustrates a story from Daoist lore about Fei Changfang, a minor official of the Han Dynasty who studied the secrets of immortality with a Daoist master. The master gave Fei a stick of bamboo one day and told him to ride it. When Fei mounted the staff, he found he could travel great distances in an instant. When he tossed the stick over a pond, it turned into a blue dragon.\r\n\r\nWang Shouqi was a poet, calligrapher, seal carver and painter from a family of high officials. He earned his <i>juren</i> degree in 1630 and published his first collection of poems three years later.",
