  "text": "His face marked by the gentle somewhat solemn expression of the Mandalay style, the Buddha is shown calling the earth to witness his sermon. This gesture or mudra has the left hand held in the lap while the right hand touches the pedestal. Called the bhumisparsamudra, this pose was especially popular in Burmese and Thai sculpture while it is encountered far less frequently in the Chinese and Japanese sculptural traditions.",
