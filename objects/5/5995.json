  "text": "In 1909, architects Purcell and Feick visted Mrs. T.B. Keith to discuss modernizing her nineteenth century home in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. In 1910, George Elmslie designed a dining room suite, including a table and at least eight chairs, that undoubtedly gave the Keith home a contemporary feel. The elaborate seat back of this chair demonstrates Elmslie's facility at translating stylized organic ornament into sawed wood. Elmslie produced similar suites for other clients, including himself and E.L. Powers of Minneapolis. The Keith's suite, however, is the only one known to survive intact, having remained in the family until its donation to The Minneapolis Institute of Arts.\r\n\r\n[insert photo of table and 5 chairs here - MIA media #38478]",
