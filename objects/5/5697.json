  "text": "Combining an office tower and a theater, the seventeen-story Schiller Building was the tallest building Adler and Sullivan constructed. The 1,286-seat theater filled the central portion up to the sixth floor. For the ornamental plaster vaults and panels, Sullivan planned a repeating pattern of stars surround by interlocking circles with lush vines and leaves in green and gold. This theme continued in the large and ornate proscenium arch. As in all Sullivan's architecture, the ornamental motif was repeated throughout the building, both inside and out, to achieve an integrated design.\r\n\r\n[insert photo of interior with proscenium arch here - Richard Nickel photo]",
