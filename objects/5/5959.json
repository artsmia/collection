  "text": "The 1950's and 60's were a time of expanding the boundaries of traditional artistic expression. Artists experimented with new forms of presentation as well as exploring the possibilities of readily available materials. Young Eastern European and American artists were particularly active in the field, which drove fabric beyond rectangular wall panels into a more sculptural form.\r\n\r\nThis is a particularly early example of fiber and mixed media contemporary art by an artist who gained considerable prominence in Europe as she continued to explore the possibilities of flexible materials resulting in abstract, boldly textural sculptural pieces.",
