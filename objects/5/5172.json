  "text": "Although board games were used in China as early as the Shang dynasty (about 1600-1027 BCE), it is likely that Chinese chess was invented in north India during the sixth century and spread to China and the West along trade routes. \r\n\r\nThis huanghuali board is inlaid with silver on one side for the game of xiangqi, or elephant chess. The thirty-two ivory markers are differentiated by a single inscribed character, colored in red or black. Chinese paintings and illustrated books show scenes of scholars playing the games of chess and weiqi (go) outdoors. This board folds up, making it convenient to transport and use outside.",
