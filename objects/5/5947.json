  "text": "This mask represents the Maya jaguar god. Such masks, often made of stone, wood, or copper, were used in rituals by high ranking members of society. Mask wearers were ceremonially transformed into the being portrayed and could interact with the spirit world. The jaguar god, one of the Mayas’ most powerful deities, represented night, shadows, war, and sacrifice. The god is identified by three dots on each cheek, symbolizing the jaguar’s spots. Maya royalty used jaguar motifs and images on clothing, jewelry, armor, and masks to demonstrate power and emphasize their relationship with the god.",
