  "text": "Flat wicker baskets are unique to the Third Mesa Hopi.   Notable for their fine weave and bright colors, these baskets have both utilitarian and ceremonial uses. They are created by women, and are given as a gift from the bride to the groom at their marriage, or carried in the women's Basket Dance.  Complicated designs are usually woven into each basket, either a figure or geometric pattern like in these examples.",
