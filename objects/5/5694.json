  "text": "Built in 1910, the Winton house has overhanging eaves and a low, horizontal roofline and entryway, all typical Prairie-style features. Maher's symmetrical plan, however, differed from the work of Wright and Purcell and Elmslie. This window is from a bank of three, overlooking the main staircase, that allowed light and air into the closet of the master bedroom. The poppy motif appeared throughout the house. During a recent restoration these windows were removed, and one was given to The Minneapolis Institute of Arts.",
