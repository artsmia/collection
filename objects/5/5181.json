  "text": "The handscroll opens with a conventional panorama of riverbanks with trees, houses, bridges, and figures set among an ample stretch of water. Across the river, the rolling hills open into a vista that curves to the left, as if drifting between sky and water. The artistâ€™s pictorial vision presents the scene as more nonreligious than sacred. The imagery is concrete, yet in subtle ways it evokes the transcendent realm.",
