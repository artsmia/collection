  "text": "As hunting declined and large animal hides became scarce, Plains men transferred their drawing skills to paper, often using sketchbooks or ruled pages of accounting ledgers.  Drawing with graphite, colored pencil and crayon instead of pigments, artists continued to depict hunting and warfare - the same themes shown on hide paintings.  They also sketched scenes of daily life or autobiographical events.",
