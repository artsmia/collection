  "text": "The bronze body of this belt hook is inset with six jade plaques, five of which are carved in shallow relief with matching scroll motifs suggesting entwined animals and stylized taotie (composite animal) masks. Dragon heads emerge at either end. The combination of precious materials here is quite luxurious. Jades had been worn as personal ornaments throughout most of the Bronze Age, and it seems natural that they would be combined with bronze and gold to create utilitarian but exceedingly sumptuous items of personal dress. The plain shield-shaped jade plaque is probably a later replacement.",
