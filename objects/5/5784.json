  "text": "Born in Nanjing, Gong Xian studied painting with Dong Qichang(1555-1636) and literature with the Buddhist monk Juelang Taosheng(1552-1659). Gong maintained loyalty to the fallen Ming dynasty under which he had been born and educated. When Manchus arrested his tutor Juelang in 1647,Gong fled to Hai'an and did not return to Nanjing until 1664. Deeply concerned with artistic legacy and aesthetic concepts, he developed a strongly personal style of form and images created with dark, heavily textured strokes and dots comprising graphically striking abstractions of light and dark. \r\n<P>The inscription reads:\r\n\r\n<P><I>Cloudy mountains soar indistinctly\r\n<P>to the border where heaven begins;\r\n<P>A solitary storied building below,\r\n<P>truly holds the eye.\r\n<P>I once asked where immortals' dwellings were located;\r\n<P>Old ears (Lao Zi) wrote in his book,\r\n<Pin the wine jar of the late Emperor\r\n<P>Gong Xian of Lucheng(\"City of Deer\")</I>\r\n\r\n<P>The reference to the \"city of deer\" is a metaphor for the imperial throne which, during much of Ming, had been located in Nanjing.",
