  "text": "Born in Nanjing, Gong Xian studied painting with Dong Qichang(1555-1636) and literature with the Buddhist monk Juelang Taosheng(1552-1659). Gong maintained loyalty to the fallen Ming dynasty under which he had been born and educated. When Manchus arrested his tutor Juelang in 1647,Gong fled to Hai'an and did not return to Nanjing until 1664. Deeply concerned with artistic legacy and aesthetic concepts, he developed a strongly personal style of form and images created with dark, heavily textured strokes and dots comprising graphically striking abstractions of light and dark. \r\nThe inscription reads:\r\n\r\nCloudy mountains soar indistinctly\r\nto the border where heaven begins;\r\nA solitary storied building below,\r\ntruly holds the eye.\r\nI once asked where immortals' dwellings were located;\r\nOld ears (Lao Zi) wrote in his book,",
