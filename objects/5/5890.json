  "text": "These fully beaded moccasins were worn for special occasions, like ceremonies, pow-wows, and celebrations. They would be used for \"show\" and illustrate the skill of the person who made them. Although moccasins with fully beaded soles have erroneously been called  \"burial moccasins\", implying that the deceased would wear them only in death, historical photographs show that living people wore them.  In a traditional setting, the viewer would be able to see the soles when the wearer rode a horse or was sitting down with his legs out in front.  These rare moccasins are of exceptional quality, illustrated by the use of color and the techniques of applying the beads.  ",
