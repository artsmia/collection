  "text": "The final chapter of the Garland Sutra (Hua yan ching) was considered essential reading for all Buddhists. It concerns the Indian boy Sudhana who, while searching for knowledge of the Buddhist law, sought advice from 53 different bodhisattvas. Finally, the bodhisattva Samantabhadra taught him his ten great compassionate vows and how to fulfill them in order to attain enlightenment.\r\n\r\nThis woodblock printed edition features a printed frontispiece in which a large seated Buddha is shown surrounded by thirty followers. Following the frontispiece is a colophon wishing prosperity and long life to the emperor. The seventy pages of text contains three large red temple seals. On the final page is an illustration of the guardian figure Wei tuo-tian.",
