  "text": "Bioma are spirit figures that were part of large presentations of objects in men's ceremonial houses, which included skulls of ancestors, enemies, crocodiles and pigs, as well as other objects. The energetic and symmetrical silhouette carved in low relief on one side of a red and white painted board is typical of bioma design. The legs are bowed to fit over one of the skulls on display.",
