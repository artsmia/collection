  "text": "Members of the Handicraft Guild of Minneapolis, founded in 1904 by members of one of the first Arts and Crafts organizations in the country, worked in the areas of metal, ceramic, leather, jewelry, and graphic design, among others. A paper label bearing the Handicraft Guild mark is located on the underside of one of the removable candle sockets on this pair of cast brass candlesticks. The pair could have been made by someone within the Guild or may have been consigned for sale in their salesroom at 89 S. 10th Street in Minneapolis. The candlesticks' tall, slender shafts and budlike holders are very similar in style to those made by Robert Jarvie of Chicago, an influental Arts and Crafts metalsmith and furniture maker.",
