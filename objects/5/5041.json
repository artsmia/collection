  "text": "Man Ray was a great contributor to the Dada and Surrealist movements, early 20th century avant-garde art movements, and spent most of his artistic career in France. He experimented with photograms, or photographs made without a camera, which he also called “rayographs”. These images were made in a darkroom by placing objects directly on photographic paper, where light was exposed. He would then develop the print resulting in an image with numerous intermingling silhouettes.\r\nThis piece, among many others in his career, is purposefully vague. The dreamlike quality to his photographs is highlighted by his statement that “I do not photograph nature. I photograph my visions.”",
