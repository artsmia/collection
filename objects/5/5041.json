  "text": "Man Ray was interested in collage as well as photography. He experimented with photograms, or cameraless images, by placing objects directly on the surface of photographic paper and exposing the uncovered areas, then developing the print with its myriad silhouettes. Here we see what resembles a rocket ship along with part of the work’s title, possibly enhanced by airbrushing techniques. The ambiguity is intentional: Ray said that his art is “designed to accuse, bewilder, annoy, or inspire reflection.” He called his own photograms “rayographs.”",
