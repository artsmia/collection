  "text": "This portrait reveals a serious woman whose modest dress is devoid of frivolous accessories. Her only finery is a delicately woven and embroidered shawl. Her arm rests on a Bible, suggesting that her reserved demeanor reflects a religious disposition.\r\n\r\nSheldon Peck embarked on a career in painting in his native Vermont. How he acquired his artistic skill is not known, but he likely was self-taught. He traveled around the Midwest in search of clients to paint, most of whom were average men and women who sought an affordable means of documenting their lives.",
