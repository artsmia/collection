  "text": "Suzuki Goro lives in Seto, an historic center of ceramic production near Nagoya. Classically trained as a potter, Suzuki uses his considerable mastery of materials and firing techniques to produce innovative works of astonishing playfulness. This finely crafted teabowl, however, reflects his more studious side; for over ten years he conducted experiments aimed at duplicating the soft tone and matte, grainy texture of Ki-Seto (Yellow Seto) ware, first developed in the late sixteenth century.",
