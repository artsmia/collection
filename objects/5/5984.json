  "text": "This rare, lacquer table and accompanying sutra covers were most likely a gift sent to Tibet from the Chinese court along with imperially commissioned sets of the 108 volume Tibetan Buddhist canon (<I>Kanjur</I>) around 1415. The table is similar in construction and incised gold-filled decoration to well-documented sutra covers made in the Chinese imperial workshops in 1410 for a special edition of the <I>Kanjur</I> presented to the head of the Sakya Monastery, Kunce Siba. Both the sutra covers and table are sumptuously decorated with gold-filled engraved designs (<I>ch'iang-chin</I> technique) of formal lotus scrolls and the eight auspicious Buddhist emblems.",
