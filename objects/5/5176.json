  "text": "The subject of this folding screen is a banquet in honor of Guo Ziyi (697–781), who is considered one of the greatest generals in Chinese history. Over the course of his long and distinguished military career, Guo served under four emperors and was thus a paragon of Confucian virtue, having devoted his entire life to his lord and country. This screen shows the retired general surrounded by his eight sons and daughters, their wives and husbands, and many grandchildren and great-grandchildren. All enjoy the festivities staged within the palace gardens. Painted with fine, even lines and brilliant pigment, this large screen is an impressive example of the kind of work produced by professional artists at the Joseon court to decorate the palaces and homes of high-ranking aristocrats. The Chinese theme suggests the extreme degree of Korea’s admiration for its large and powerful neighbor.",
