  "text": "Created a year after the Kublai Khan collection and named for the golden-domed Turkestan capital exotic <I>Samarkand</I> exemplified the company’s marketing phrase “romancing the collection.” The flamboyant motifs and colors borrow from the spring flowering in the Asiatic steppes.<P>\r\nSales of Larsen fabrics were not limited to the United States. Economic considerations at times made it reasonable to have two production centers for certain fabrics, such as <I>Samarkand</I>, which was popular in both the United States and Europe. This design remained in stock until 1987.",
