  "text": "In addition to dramatic “signature” pieces, the studio designed numerous upholstery and casement textiles intended to provide a quiet but distinctive quality to the interior environment.  Color was always an important factor; much care was taken to simulate the colors in nature through the juxtaposition of yarns of varying hues, thus avoiding the flat, undifferentiated look of a painted surface. The concept developed during the design process was further enhanced by Jack’s ability to relate the color choices directly to nature. Luxor came in several colors, including woodhue, sugar plum, blue spruce and night violet.",
