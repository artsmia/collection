  "text": "In addition to dramatic “signature” pieces, the studio designed numerous upholstery and casement textiles intended to provide a quiet but distinctive quality to the interior environment.  Color was always an important factor; much care was taken to simulate the colors in nature through the juxtaposition of yarns of varying hues, thus avoiding the flat, undifferentiated look of a painted surface. The concept developed during the design process was further enhanced by Jack’s ability to relate the color choices directly to nature. <I>Luxor</I> came in several colors, including woodhue, sugar plum, blue spruce and night violet.",
