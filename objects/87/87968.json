  "text": "Created a year after the Kublai Khan collection and named for the golden-domed Turkestan capital exotic Samarkand exemplified the company’s marketing phrase “romancing the collection.” The flamboyant motifs and colors borrow from the spring flowering in the Asiatic steppes.\r\nSales of Larsen fabrics were not limited to the United States. Economic considerations at times made it reasonable to have two production centers for certain fabrics, such as Samarkand, which was popular in both the United States and Europe. This design remained in stock until 1987.",
