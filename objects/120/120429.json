  "text": "This painting’s focus on a towering rock outcropping gives it a monumental quality, although the work itself is quite small. Created in the late 1400s, it represents the continuation of an enduring tradition in landscape painting initiated during China’s Northern Song dynasty (960–1127). The tall pines and primary reliance on gradient tones of ink to define rock and mountain forms are also hallmarks of the era.",
