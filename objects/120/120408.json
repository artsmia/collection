  "text": "David Maisel’s photography captures the radical transformation of the physical and environmental effects of human consumption and inhabitation have on the landscape of the American West. More than a mere document, this photograph evokes sublime beauty and apocalyptic destruction, positioning Maisel within the complex dialogue of landscape photography that seeks to not only frame but interpret issues of contemporary landscape and culture.  Maisel unveils the magnitude of ecological devastation that punctuates the vast frontier of the American West, a space that is often represented in the visual, cinematic, and literary arts as endless and eternal.",
