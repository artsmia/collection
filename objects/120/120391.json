  "text": "Sasai Fumie, Associate Professor at Kyoto City University of Arts, says about herself: “I create pieces that are based on forms that I believe have endearing universal appeal, such as flowers, fruit or children. I use matt surfaces and soft forms to express tenderness in order to elicit these feelings from other people.” Sasai was born in Osaka and was raised in a family lacking connections to the world of artistic lacquer production. She decided on lacquer as her medium in art school and has since undergone several periods in her career, moving from rounded forms to sprouted ones and working with different techniques. She recently embarked on a collaboration with a bamboo artist.",
