  "text": "This carved wooden bottle and stopper from Somalia with its interlacing geometric patterns is called weyso or quluc. Weyso also means “ablution” (ceremonial washing), which is one of the bottle’s functions: to hold the water used to wash the face, hands, and feet before offering prayers to God. The bottle may have also been used by a faith-based healer. After writing Qur’anic verses or religious formulas on a wooden board, the healer washes off the words and signs, and captures the water. This water can be used to heal or protect the believer.",
