  "text": "This manuscript leaf exhibits high action, beautiful coloring, a complex composition and supremely skillful painting—qualities found in the best Mughal production. Artistic production flourished under Akbar’s reign, and books decorated with exquisite paintings such as the Zafarnama were the most prized objects in the royal treasury. They communicated his wealth and prestige and articulated a historical lineage that earned him fame and respect. This is a foundational work for the South Asian and Islamic collections and is the first addition that is known to have come from an imperial Mughal atelier.",
