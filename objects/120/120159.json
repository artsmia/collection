  "text": "Satō Satoshi has made himself a name by producing witty, playful. He achieves this by creating unusual but functional forms that he embellishes with caricature-like, simple drawings, executed in vivid colors. Recalling literati works of art, his ceramics are therefore called Satō Nanga. This is one of his larger works illustrating a vivid scene of monks attending a feast.",
