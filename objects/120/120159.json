  "text": "Satō Satoshi made a name for himelf by producing functional forms that are also witty and playful, embellished with caricature-like, simple drawings in vivid colors. In their simplicity and directness, his works recall the ceramics made by literati scholar-artists (nanga) many centuries earlier, and are therefore called Satō Nanga. This is one of his larger works, illustrating a vivid scene of monks at a feast.",
