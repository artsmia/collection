  "text": "Emin’s works are deeply entwined with her personal narrative. It is through her personal experiences that her work explores universal emotions such as love, desire, anger, and pain. With You I Want to Live co-opts an industrial, masculine material generally associated with commercialism, to produces a glowing proclamation—one that is written in the artist’s own script and thus seems surprisingly intimate.",
