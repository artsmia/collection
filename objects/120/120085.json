  "text": "Tracey Emin’s personal narrative is deeply entwined with her artwork and practice. Throughout her career, she has mined her personal experiences, resulting in works that explore broadly relatable emotions such as love, desire, anger, and pain. In With You I Want to Live, Emin co‑opts neon, an industrial material generally associated with commercialism, to produce a glowing proclamation—one that is written in the artist’s own script and thus seems surprisingly intimate.",
