  "text": "The bell with a <i>vajra handle</i> (Tibetan: <i>dorje drilbu</i>; Sanskrit: <i>vajra ghanta</i>) is a liturgical implement used in Tibetan Buddhist rituals. The <i>vajra</i> represents the compassion of the Buddha, the masculine principle; and the bell represents wisdom, the female principle. To achieve enlightenment, these two principles must be combined. The face appearing on the bell’s handle is associated with transcendent insight. The prongs recall the thunderbolt scepter of Indra, a Hindu warrior god who governs rain, clouds, and lightning. The bell’s body is further embellished by a wreath of miniature <i>vajras</i> encircling the opening, while the “wheel of the law” is repeated around the body of the bell.",
