  "text": "Ōtagaki Rengetsu’s distinctive calligraphy is an elegantly subtle yet integral part of\r\nthis hanging flower vase. Her professional career had floundered for many years, and it\r\nwas only in her late forties and early fifties that this nun-turned-poet finally found her\r\nfame by literally making her mark on everyday ceramics. Her poetry and calligraphic\r\nstyle has been emulated and forged, and it is said that Rengetsu had even signed forgeries as her own works in order to help other potters’ succeed.",
