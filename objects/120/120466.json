  "text": "Holzapfel has carved one piece of cherry burl into two interlocked pieces. A small curving vase-like form loops around several handles on the side of the large vase. A fan of texture and irregularity in her wood art, she has taken advantage of the variegated surface and figure of the irregular burl. She explains, “This piece wasn’t turned at all, but bandsawn and carved, then highly polished. The form is interlinked and interdependent: a duet, pas de deux, Lester Young and Billie Holiday.”",
