  "text": "Ōtagaki Rengetsu’s distinctive calligraphy is a subtle and elegant yet integral part of this hanging flower vase. While her professional career floundered for many years, it was only in her late forties and early fifties when this nun-turned-poet literally made her mark on ceramics of everyday objects that she became famous. Her poetry and calligraphic style has been emulated and forged and it is said Rengetsu had even signed forgeries as her own works in order to help other potters’ studios succeed. The poem on the vase reads: My happy times stretch out like a long cucumber; how many have there been? Rengetsu",
