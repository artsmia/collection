  "text": "Among the foremost avant-garde lacquer sculpture artists active today in Japan, Tanaka Nobuyuki experiments with the dual role of lacquer as both surface and form. Moving beyond the traditional limitations of the medium, he creates large-scale, freestanding forms like this sculpture, his largest work to date. Born in Tokyo and trained at the prestigious Tokyo University of the Arts, Tanaka is currently a professor at Kanazawa College of Art.",
