  "text": "Jean Demosthene Dugourc was a leading designer during the reign of Louis XVI. In 1764, he traveled to Rome as part of the retinue of the Comte de Cany. There he drew directly from the antique. After his return to France, his work for prominent patrons helped to spread the taste for arabesques and the Etruscan style: figures of Graces, winged women playing the lyre, snakes, sphinxes, scrolls, cornucopias, figure drawings in shades, medallions—the type of work plainly in evidence in the present allegorical print which represents the god Mars and the act of war.",
