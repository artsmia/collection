  "text": "An elegantly dressed man sits sideways on a chair. He wears a monocle over his left eye, and he is neatly groomed with strawberry blonde hair and a full beard and mustache. His left elbow rests on the back of the chair and his head leans on his right hand in a melancholic pose, although his expression is self-assured. The portrait is brightly painted with loose, lively brushwork. At the top right corner there is an inscription in French, which reads, as translated: “to my friend Lafrance, A. Besnard, 3 July 1875.”",
