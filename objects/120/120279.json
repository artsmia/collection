  "text": "This brightly colored textile is a <i>picchavai</i>, or ceremonial hanging, used in temples from the Rajasthan region. The temples and picchavai are devoted to a form of the god Krishna named Srinathji, the central figure with the raised left hand who is also repeated around the border. Priests changed <i>picchavais</i> frequently according to the seasons and festivals. This one illustrates Srinathji being worshipped by priests and devotees in an <i>annukata</i> (mountain of food) ceremony, which likely would have occurred the day on which it was hung. It would have been displayed directly behind the temple’s main deity, heightening the overall devotional experience.",
