  "text": "Sheila Hicks is one of today’s leading artists working in the fiber medium. Though she works primarily with textiles, she rejects the label of weaver and regards herself instead to be a painter who works with colored fibers and a drawer who uses three dimensional lines. This small bundle evidences Hicks’ love for color experimentation with its striking contrast of chartreuse and orange. Over her long career, Hicks has produced many iterations of fiber tufts like this one, ranging in scale from a few inches to monumental “sumo balls.” She approaches her smaller works as chances to work out ideas – particularly those having to do with color – in a process she describes as intuitive observation.",
