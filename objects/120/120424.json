  "text": "This handscroll depicts a romantic scene. The springtime setting features peach blossoms and green willows in the mist. A young man on horseback, seemingly in a hurry, is distracted by a young woman who stands in the window of a thatched hut. The painting is based on literary sources. Among others, one specific poem by Cui Hu (c. 766–') likely provided inspiration for the artist. The poem, titled “Village at the South of the City,” reads: This very day last year by this door, Peach blossoms were in bloom against her blushing cheeks. But where, pray, is she now, while the peach blossoms Are still there, smiling in the spring breezes' (Translated by Shuhui Yang and Yunqin Yang, in Stories to Caution the World: A Ming Dynasty Collection, University of Washington Press, 2005)",
