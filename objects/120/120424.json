  "text": "In imperial China, most marriages were arranged by families (especially among the gentry) to meet a specific social need. In popular culture, however, there was no lack of depictions of “love at first sight.” The passion, excitement, and intoxication of falling in love were often captured by showing the moment when two sets of eyes met, and love blossomed. Such a meeting is the subject of this painting, which depicts a romantic springtime scene featuring peach blossoms and green willows shrouded in mist.",
