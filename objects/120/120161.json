In the case of Zhang Guolao (Chōkarō in Japanese), his unique characteristic is his ability to fold his mule, which is able to carry him thousands of miles without rest, into his drinking gourd when not in use. Hashimoto Gahō was an influential figure in art circles during Japan’s modernization and he was renowned for his bold painting style inspired by earlier prototypes.",
