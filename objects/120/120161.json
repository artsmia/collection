  "text": "Sennin, borrowed from the Chinese word xianjin or ‘immortal being,’ refers to Daoist transcendents with distinct magical attributes. In the case of Chōkarō Sennin, his unique characteristic is his ability to fold his mule, which is able to carry him thousands of miles without rest, into his drinking gourd when not in use. Hashimoto Gahō was an influential figure in art circles during Japan’s modernization and he was renowned for his bold painting style inspired by earlier prototypes. Very effectively, he used gold color for the outline of Chōkarō Sennin’s face and hands.",
