  "text": "This drawing manual features 24 designs by the celebrated Venetian draftsman and painter Giovanni Battista Piazzetta. He produced the drawings shortly before his death for the planned publication of this drawing manual. Such books were common teaching tools for artists and amateurs learning to draw in the 18th century. Piazzetta’s drawings are reproduced in the book in pairs, with 24 simple outline prints by Francesco Bartolozzi interleaved with 24 tonal engravings of the same designs by Marco Pitteri. Bartolozzi’s linear prints provide simpler forms for the beginning draftsman to copy. Pitteri’s prints, on the other hand, achieve a more dramatic effect, with vibrant softened lines and an impressive range of tones that convincingly model the forms in the compositions.",
