  "text": "Philip Larson uses the vocabulary of architecture to inform his graphic art. Using highly simplified abstract elements, Larson focuses attention on the formal and aesthetic qualities of his subject. On first viewing, the “emptiness” of the rectangle dominates our perception, but our eye is soon drawn to what appears to be an ornamental linear detail along the bottom of the image. The detail’s form and isolation within the composition lends itself to careful consideration. Though it may appear cool and detached, the drawing emphasizes its own materiality, and on closer examination, reveals its handmade qualities. Elegant and austere, the drawing highlights subtleties of form and substance, perhaps reminding us that beauty is a state of mind.",
