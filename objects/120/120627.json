  "text": "JoAnn Verburg is one of the most important artists working in Minnesota today, and Still Life with Jim, 1991, is one of her most significant works. A compelling triptych, it highlights the artist’s deep interest and knowledge in the history of art as well as her technical virtuosity of photographic methods and processes. By working in the triptych format, Verburg takes an everyday subject – a man taking a nap – and elevates it through the combination of different pictorial compositions within one work. It is at once a beautifully composed still life and an intimate portrait of her husband, Jim Moore.",
