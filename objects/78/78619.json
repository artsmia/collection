  "text": "Dragon and tiger is a common pairing in East Asian art. According to the Chinese classic Yijing (Book of Changes), the dragon commands the clouds and therefore the heavens, while the tiger controls the wind and thus the earth. Together, the two creatures encompass the universe and were considered auspicious symbols.\r\nIn this pair of hanging scrolls, the tiger sits next to a small sprig of bamboo. Diagonal streaks of ink wash mimic the movement of wind. The dragon rises, barely revealing itself through breaks in the clouds. Its head emerges from splashed ink, offering a moment of visibility before it retreats into the heavens.",
