  "text": "In China, the birth of the round fan was much earlier than that of the folding variety. Such fans were already popular in the Han dynasty (202 BCE–204). They were not only tools for cooling oneself, but were also symbolic accessories signifying social status and noble taste. This fan bears a beautifully rendered ink landscape. The compositional formula of placing landscape elements in one corner while leaving the opposing side open to create a heightened sense of depth and atmosphere was championed by the artists Ma Yuan and Xia Gui during the Southern Song dynasty (1127–1279).",
