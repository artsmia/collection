  "text": "Tall trees on the riverbank tower above a cottage nestled below. A layer of snow covers its roof as well as the nearby rocks and distant mountain peaks. A boat on the river to the right is rowed by a single boatman. These elements comprise a quiet yet dramatically rendered scene on a round fan. \r\nDuring the Song dynasty, fans were not only used to cool oneself but signified social status and noble taste. This fan, with its miniature landscape, would have communicated lofty, scholarly ideals on behalf of the user. Chinese landscape paintings, though typically monumental in scale, were regarded as the highest form of Chinese art and were laden with meaning beyond the external world, in this case contrasting the smallness of humanity with the grandness of nature.",
