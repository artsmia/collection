Based on Ichikawa Chūsha VII (1860-1936) as Kiichi Hōgen in the scene Imadegawa Kikubatake of the play Kiichi Hōgen sanryaku no maki 鬼一法眼三略巻　今出川菊畑 (Kiichi Hōgen’s Three-volume Book of Tactics), performed at the Hongō Theater, November 1924.\r\n\r\nKiichi Hōgen is an elderly strategist who is in the possession of an important book on strategy that he tries to safe keep. As this print does not have a publisher's seal and the paper is larger than that used consistently fur Shunsen’s commercial actor prints, it would seem to have been a special edition, probably commissioned by the fan club of the actor and not meant for commercial sale.",
