  "text": "In order to show the strength of bamboo in this piece, Uematsu used a distinctive type of bamboo from Kōchi Prefecture (Tosa) called shichikudake or kurochiku. This work pays homage to the bamboo artist, Shōno Shōunsai (1904–1974), who Uematsu respected very highly. Shōno was named a Living National Treasure in 1967 and was active in Beppu, Ōita Prefecture, where Uematsu was trained.",
