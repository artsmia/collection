  "text": "Miroku Bosatsu is seated on a lotus throne perched on a struggling demon, holding a pagoda in his upturned palms. The statue retains its original metal raiments, as well as the gold leaf decoration on the draped robes. The figure’s princely attire indicates that Miroku is being depicted in his incarnation as a bodhisattva, an enlightened being who delays nirvana in order to guide others to enlightenment, rather than his incarnation as the future Buddha.",
