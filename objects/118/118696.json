  "text": "“An Autumn View from a Boat on the Ki River” The waves enfold their pure white silk, the wild geese come down in pairs, Here in the boat of Li and Duo, wine now fills our jars. Gulls and egrets already have forgotten the seaside visitors; As for perch, what need to go to River Wu' Through evening bell and drizzling rain, the travelers strive to cross; Red smartweed and white duckweed fill autumn stepping-stones. Fishermen’s flutes waft on the wind—the tunes play without cease; On view of sandbanks and new-risen moon, we open cabin windows!",
