  "text": "Luminous colors overlaying a patchwork of textures give the painting a luxurious surface favored in contemporary Japanese painting. The playful composition and range of brushstrokes recall the work of earlier nanga masters, but Kodōjin’s vigorous, wriggly line work is his own. He appears to have led the ideal life of the scholar-artist, as expressed in the Chinese poem inscribed on this painting.\r\n \r\nThe inscription reads:\r\nOne day I shall imbibe the Primal Ether,\r\nand all four limbs will be in harmony.\r\nFloating, floating, I'll mount a solitary crane,\r\nand vastly, vastly ride the long wind!\r\nOne leap up and I'll pierce 10,000 miles,\r\nsoaring on high, reaching the azure vault!\r\nMy powerful ambition set on the ninth heaven,\r\nmy journeying heart covering all the four seas!\r\nTowering, mountainous, colored clouds will rise,\r\nscintillating, the morning sun rise red!\r\nAll 10,000 creatures will emit a brilliant radiance,\r\nand the eight corners of the universe—how dazzling they will be!\r\nThe Achieved Man must engage in perfect transformation,\r\nso wondrous junctures will never be exhausted.\r\nOnce metamorphosed into the bones of an immortal,\r\nfree-and-easy wandering without beginning or end!\r\n(Translated by Jonathan Chaves)",
