  "inscription": "(1) In this place, where the ancient Way shines forth in mystery,/ the True Man brings past karma to an end. / Beside the gully, many whitened rocks; / among bamboo appears the crystal stream. / I let down my hair and whistle out long each day, / wander free and easy, enjoying nature alone. / From time to time the bright moon comes, / its reflection appearing right in my cup of wine. // (2) In vain they say, \\\"Take joy in these days!\\\" / -- Living in seclusion, I write poems on ancient feelings. / Here in the mountains I naturally preserve the Way; / beneath forest trees I now have lodged my life. / The rain has passed, the plums put forth first blossoms; / with mist to clothe them, willow-buds already formed. / I go out the gate -- Spring is vague and misty; / painting its colors, facing men in peace. // (3) Alone, I\\'ve become a scholar of noble reclusion, / starting to sense how venerable is this life in plain clothes./ Should you suddenly come to believe in my Way, / please come visite, and we\\'ll share our tranquil words. / It\\'s not that the dusty realm is utterly without pleasures, / but it lacks any ground to plant the Fragrant Root. / Year after year I send out these \\\"elegant orchids\\'\\\" / hoping the subtle perfume may be preserved. // (4) Years ago, I was first to \\\"clap my hands;\\\" [\\\"Clap my hands:\\\" To greet guests.] / when guests arrived, it brought joy to my face! / But this place is quite remote, secluded, / only the white clouds return to the worldly sphere. / And so I became a \\\"scholar beneath the woods,\\\" / trance-like, alone viewing mountains... / All I do is smile and never answer: / heaven and earth, together with my heart, serene. // (5) For long I harbored \\\"white cloud\\\" ambition; / now at last I\\'ve built my hut beneath the pines! / I can write poems about \\\"percing\\\" and \\\"lingering,\\\" / as I just take pleasure here in lute and books. / Nor do I resent the lack of \\\"shareres of the tune:\\\" / in fact I\\'ve always lived alone with the Way. / Now I just follow what I want to do: / what further need to ask about",
