The series consists of more than 1000 photographs and is considered iconic by both the worlds of fashion photography and social documentary photography, for capturing both Nigerian femininity and vernacular culture.\r\n\r\n‘Okhai Ojeikere’s photographs will be the first in the collection by the Nigerian photographer and as such mark an important expansion of our holdings of African photography.",
