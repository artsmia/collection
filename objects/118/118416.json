  "text": "Since around 1700, peacocks were imported into Japan. Two such peacocks are standing here close to each other on a blooming magnolia tree. Both are placed in the upper right corner, one being almost completely hidden behind the other and only his head and feet are visible. The long and bright feathers of the peacock in the front reach outside the picture and return into the bottom. In contrast to the ostentatious, intricately painted feathers, simple, white blooming magnolias dominate the lower part of the picture.",
