  "text": "In an unusually detailed way, but without losing any of their decorative effects, two peonies are captured, being blown violently in a summer rain storm. The waving diagonals of clouds in the background suggest that storm clouds are moving quickly across the sky.\r\n\r\nSakai Ho_itsu was not only a painter, but also a poet and man of letters. He came from a high-level samurai family, but chose to enter priesthood at the age of thirty-six rather than following a political career. Ho_itsu enjoyed a very good education and trained himself in the styles of Chinese masters and <i>ukiyo-e</i> painters. After 1797, however, he devoted himself solely to the Rinpa school with the aim of reviving the style of Ko_rin. Ko_rin had worked for the Sakai family five generations before, which gave Ho_itsu the opportunity to study his works in depth. Ho_itsu was truly devoted to Ko_rin, but did not simply copy his style, instead he perfected it by combining it with techniques from other contemporary painting schools.",
