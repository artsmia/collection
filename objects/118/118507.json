  "text": "According to a Chinese legend, carp transform into dragons when they swim against the strong current of a waterfall and leap over the top. In Japan, the theme of the carp jumping over a waterfall symbolizes success in overcoming a major obstacle. For that reason, on Boys’ Day (May 5), Japanese families raise colorful carp-shaped flags to wish their boys health and courage.",
