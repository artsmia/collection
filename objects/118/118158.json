  "inscription": "I have read the \"Sho kaishi\" [kaishi of the New Year]; it is really interesting. I have nothing more to say but to offer you my congratulations. However, the poem about the wild mouse has a loss of meaning in the first part due to the emphasis upon 'scratching its face.' It is not like a pheasant scratching its face, and so it is disappointing. This poem could have been a good one, but you have tried too much and therefore the feeling was lost. / This winter I have been suffering from illness due to my old age. It is difficult to think of ideas for poems and so I have not been writing poetry at all. However, I am not so ill as to have thoughts of death. Now I am sick in bed as I receive your letter. While rubbing my eyes which have become dim with age, I am answering hurriedly since you have requested an immediate response. I'll talk more with you when I see you, / -the 17th day, Yahan / P.S. My foolish poem on the printed sheet of Kitano looks quite appropriate; the block copy has come out in an interesting way, in fact it is unprecedented. (AS)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
