  "text": "At the center of this scroll is the historical Buddha, Sakyamuni, the ancient sage on whose teachings Buddhism is based. The bird-shaped mountain peak just above him is Vulture Peak, Sakyamuni’s favorite retreat in northwest India, where he preached his teachings to his original disciples, known as the arhats. In this painting, sixteen arhats occupy positions on the paths and hills surrounding Sakyamuni. According to Buddhist scripture, the arhats gained supernatural powers and longer lifespans in order to carry on the Buddha’s teaching, known as the Dharma, until the Buddha of the Future arrives, many eons from now.",
