  "text": "Whoever wore this cotton tunic, more than a hundred years ago, was a member of the military nobility of the West African Anufo people. Verses from chapters 5 and 38 of the Qur’an, and invocations of God the Merciful, inscribed on the garment by a Muslim cleric, offered fortitude and protection. Blocks of wavy lines around the shoulders look like Arabic letters but are not readily legible. They form a repetitive script, possibly a supernatural language invoking the assistance of jinn, spirits that, according to the Qur’an, God created of “smokeless fire.”\r\n\r\n\r\nInterpretation of text:\r\nIndeed, this is Our provision; for it there is no depletion.\r\nIn the name of God, the Lord of Mercy, the Giver of Mercy! God knows, He is the most Merciful! God protects you from people.\r\nIn the name of God, the Lord of Mercy, the Giver of Mercy! Oh God, the Merciful! Oh God! Oh God! Oh God!\r\n",
