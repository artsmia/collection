  "text": "Gustaf Fjaestad made the Swedish winter landscape his hallmark. In hundreds of paintings, he explored the myriad effects of light upon snow. In Winter Landscape, Gustaf Fjaestad employs a personal form of Pointillism, using a pattern of dots and lines to create a snowscape of calm natural beauty. This painting is a large and important addition to the MIA’s collection of 19th and 20th century Nordic paintings, which has been steadily growing over the past five years. \r\n",
