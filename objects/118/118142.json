  "text": "A gust of wind cuts through the mountain valley, kicking up snow on its way. Yasuda Rōzan used ink wash to give it shape but left blank implied through architecture—a temple in the distance, a house hidden among branches in the foreground. The sky glows gray, suggesting that the snowfall is ongoing.\r\nThe inscription at the top right is from a poem titled “Facing Snow” by Chinese poet Du Fu (712–770):\r\nRiotous clouds lower in sunset, Swift, urgent snow dances in whirlwinds",
  "title": "Sudden Snow Dances in the Whirlwind"
