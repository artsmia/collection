Bamboo was considered one of the fundamental forms of painting in the Chinese style, and their pairing with Chinese poetry further highlights Doi’s erudition.\r\nLeft screen, poems on panels from right to left:\r\n報答春光知有處，應須美酒送生涯。\r\nI know where to go to appreciate the springtime,\r\nfine wine is needed to bid farewell to my years\r\nDu Fu, “Seven-Character Poem on Seeking Flowers\r\nAlone by the Riverside” (Tang Dynasty)\r\n閒眠盡日無人到，自有春風為掃門\r\nIdly napping for the whole day with no visitors,\r\nspring wind sweeps my door\r\nWang Anshi, “Among the Bamboo” (Song Dynasty)\r\n日斜回首江頭望，一片晴雲落後山\r\nLooking back along the riverbank in the setting\r\nsun, a band of clear cloud descends on the rear\r\nmountains\r\nTang Qiu, “For Changle Temple” (Tang Dynasty)\r\n問余何意棲碧山，笑而不答心自閒。\r\nAsking me why I reside in the Green Mountain, I\r\nsmile quietly with an idiosyncratic heart\r\nLi Bai, “Questions and Responses in the Mountains”\r\n(Tang Dynasty)\r\nRight screen, poems on panels from right to left:\r\n凍蕊凝香色艷新，小山深塢伴幽人。\r\nFrozen pistils, condensed fragrance and brilliant colors,\r\na small hill and deep basin accompany lonely visitors\r\nLu Xisheng, “Plum Blossom Basin.
