  "text": "Eyes raised, mouth agape, and with legs and arms sprawled out in front of him, the God of Thunder falls backward onto his behind in surprise. The God of Thunder, known as raijin, is usually represented as a horned demon-like figure wearing a tiger-skin loincloth. He carries a set of drums on his back, which he strikes with a stick to make the booming sound of thunder. He is often paired with the God of Wind, fūjin, who carries a bag of wind instead of drums.",
