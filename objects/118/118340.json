  "text": "This work is another example of the senshū-ami technique. The understated color and form and the simple, organic curves of this flower basket are reminiscent of dried, hollowed gourds used for flower arrangements. The Tanabe family has produced several series of similar baskets, but in this case no color was used in the lacquer, a finish known as shirasabi in the artist’s circle. Like the previous work, this piece has a signed original box with the inscription, Tekisuikyo, referring to the place where the family lived at the time that this basket was made.",
