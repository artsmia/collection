  "text": "Chikuunsai founded a family of bamboo artists still active today, and in 1915 became the first bamboo artist to have a solo exhibition. He made this flower basket when he was 55 and had already made bamboo baskets for 42 years. He considered himself aged, and the title he gave this work reflects his wish for a long life. In fact, some might see an allusion in the shape of this basket to Mount Hōrai on the legendary Chinese Isle of Eternal Youth. Chikuunsai died five years later.",
