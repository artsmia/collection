  "text": "Though painted in the Edo period, the composition of this work is nearly identical to depictions of Jizō from centuries earlier due to the highly codified nature of Buddhist imagery. Here, Jizō descends from the heavens holding his usual accoutrements—a monk’s staff with six dangling rings and the ‘wish granting’ jewel—and wears the robes and shaved head of a monk.\r\nSakai Hōitsu is best known for his decorative Rinpa works which covered birds and flowers, and subjects from classic literature, however, in 1798, Hōitsu became a lay monk, after which he produced a rash of Buddhist paintings.",
