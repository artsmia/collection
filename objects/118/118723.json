  "text": "This is a rendering of the famous Song of Tea that the Chinese poet Lu Tong (790–835) composed to share his sensation about tea.\r\n“Thanking Imperial Advisor Meng for the Fresh Tea He Has Sent Me”\r\nThe sun seemed fifteen feet above me, and I had fallen asleep\r\nWhen an army officer knocked at the door, waking this Duke of Chou.\r\nHe tells me the Advisor has sent me a letter\r\nOn white silk with slanting fold and three official seals.\r\nI open the missive—it is as if the Advisor and I are face to face—\r\nAnd inspect by hand the Moon Brick tea, three hundred pieces of it.\r\nI have heard that early in the year, if one goes up in the mountains, Hibernating creatures are beginning to move and spring winds are starting to blow.\r\nThe Son of Heaven, desiring men to taste fine Yangxian tea, All other plants never dare to blossom first.\r\nA gentle breeze secretly forms buds like pearls; \r\nBefore spring actually arrives, they put forth sprouts of yellow gold.\r\nThe fresh plants are gathered, the fragrant tea is fire-dried and pressed into bricks, The very best, the most exquisite—no empty luxury.\r\nAside from the Most Honored, it is suitable for princes and dukes;\r\nSo how is it that now it has arrived at the home of a mountain man?\r\nMy bramble gate closed tight against vulgar visitors, Wearing a cap of gauze, by myself I boil and taste the tea.\r\nThe blue smoke cloud, drawn by the wind, remains unbroken;\r\nA white froth—floating luster—congeals in the bowl.\r\nWith bowl number one, my throat and lips are moistened;\r\nWith bowl number two, my lonely sadness is dispelled.\r\nBowl number three cleans out my withered bowels, Leaving only five thousand volumes inside!\r\nWith bowl number four, I raise a light sweat\r\nAnd all the worrisome affairs of my entire life evaporate through the pores.\r\nWith bowl number five, my skin and bones are purified;\r\nWith bowl number six, I commune with immortal spirits.\r\nBowl number seven I can barely get down;\r\nI only feel pure wind blowing, swishing beneath my arms!\r\nThe mountains of the Penglai paradise, where can they be found?\r\nThe Master of Jade Stream wants to mount this pure wind and go there now.\r\nThe myriad immortals on these mountains officiate over this lowly realm;\r\nTheir position is noble and pure, beyond stormy rains.\r\nWhat do they know of the millions of beings\r\nTumbling from precipitous cliffs, suffering so much!\r\nLet me question the advisor about these sentient beings:\r\nUltimately, should they obtain respite, or not?",
