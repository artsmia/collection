  "text": "Summer in Japan means blazing heat and humidity—and the inescapable clicks and chirps of cicadas. Some sing “sha sha sha” or “meen meen meeeeeeen” only in the morning. Others sing only on cool afternoons or only at dusk, signaling the end of the day with their “ki ki ki.” Love them or hate them, hundreds of cicadas seem to cling to every tree in sight. \r\n\r\nThis hanging basket for displaying flowers takes the shape of this enduring symbol of summer; in fact, cicadas are among a select few animals who lend their form to traditional bamboo basketry.  When hung on a wall, its remarkably naturalistic legs, skin, eyes, and wings (woven separately and attached with ties of thin rattan) make it appear as if it has just landed there.",
