  "text": "The use of shadows in this work is as substantive as the bamboo and string comprising it. The shadow cast against the wall magnifies the work’s gentle undulations. Having spent the first half of his career crafting traditional bamboo flower baskets, Chikuyū began making carefully constructed sculptural works such as this in the 1990s. No other bamboo artist seems to have created mobiles, and Chikuyū himself has produced only two.",
