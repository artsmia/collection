  "text": "In this work, Penelope Umbrico photographed 136 mini film cameras from the Smithsonian’s collection from above. She then applied a photoshop filter to the work. They are usually displayed flat inside a case, and it might almost seem as if the cameras are actually just beneath the surface, instead of being a photograph. \r\nUmbrico notes that while once revolutionary, these cameras are now “inanimate and obsolete, carefully tagged, boxed, and archived.” While her subject is film cameras, she is also interested in how photography is produced, and the technical history of photography. This work questions the history of photographic production and thinks about the omnipresence of photography in the contemporary world.",
