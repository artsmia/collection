His colorful and exuberant paintings represent a fusion of the styles of nanga, Rinpa, Kano, and modern Western painting, and are among the masterpieces of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. He was also a skilled calligrapher. The clerical script in which Wine and Tea is executed is rarely seen in Tessai’s oeuvre; this was created early in his career, before he settled on his expressive running and cursive scripts that are found in his later works. Tessai was a great collector of seals; the lower of these three is a foretaste of the breathtaking variety of unusual, creative and skillfully carved seals that would adorn his work.",
