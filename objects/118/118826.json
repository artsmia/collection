  "text": "In traditional Chinese belief, great mountains were mysterious and possibly dangerous realms, because they contained not only deities but also ghosts and monsters who would sometimes harm people. Paintings like this one expressed these beliefs. It features a popular subject, Zhong Kui, the demon tamer, riding in a sedan chair carried by three demons. He is protected from the sun by an umbrella, which also serves to assert his high status and extraordinary powers. He is depicted traveling in his domain, hunting ghosts and in the company of the demons he has conquered.",
