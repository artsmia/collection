  "text": "A man wearing a straw coat and hat trudges alone across a bridge, suggesting that the snow has settled enough for him to resume travel. The snowy landscape seems to radiate white from the reflection of light. Imaōji Yūzan created the mystical glow by rendering mountains and trees with ink wash, a technique described as “boneless,” or without defining contours or outlines. The snow itself is represented by the blank paper.\r\nImaōji studied ink painting under Nakabayashi Chikutō (whose work is also in this gallery) and was known for his landscapes and plants.",
