  "text": "“The Ballad of Sanjō Bridge”\r\nSanjō Bridge—ah! The road to the Seven Circuits.\r\nFolk who live in the sixty provinces flock here like ducks.\r\nThe Kamo River suddenly rises, banks about to burst.\r\nBut this bridge stands proud and tall, its rock foundations firm.\r\nLook at the stone plinths all along the bridge—\r\nThey go into the ground to a depth of five jin.\r\nThose carved dragons never decaying, cast of the finest copper.\r\nWho was it who constructed this? Lord Toyo[-tomi] was his name.\r\n‘Twas in the eighteenth year of Tenshō [1590], the kō-in cyclical year.\r\nIn the springtime, the first month, the projects was completed.\r\nInscribed words, ten lines long, the characters still fresh.\r\nDamming the flow, they dug out the flood-dragons and water-lizards from their holes.\r\nThey flogged the stone, extracting its blood—who among them shrank?\r\nAccording to the historical records, it was the third month of the year\r\nThat our sterling lord received an edict to join the Eastern Expedition. \r\nAt that time, the chariots of war had just begun to move.\r\nThe pennants and halberds that he took up were as vast as the back of a whale.\r\nThe cavalry and foot-soldiers numbered 150,000 men.\r\nArmor and lances shone in the sunlight—oh, so very bright.\r\nOne can visualize their false whiskers, which lent them martial splendor.\r\nThe panorama!—they packed the bridge, spilling out onto Kujō-dori [Ninth Avenue]!\r\nIn their eyes, the Eight Provinces simply did not exist;\r\nTo the armies who chased down the enemy, those troops were but slaves and lackeys.\r\nThe road to the “maggot states” had for ages been impassable;\r\n[But] with his hand holding the ceremonial sword, he cut his way through the brambles.\r\nAfterwards, with their bearskins and their arrows made from reeds,\r\nThey all assembled on the east side of the Sanjō Bridge.\r\nDon’t you see how all these men put the world in order?\r\nSeveral lords working together,\r\nJointly achieving peace!\r\nFor the Great Wall, the men of Han depended upon Emperor Ch’in.\r\nFor the Kaifeng ramparts, the men of Sung relied upon their Chou ancestors.\r\nIn military campaigns one is not without the achievements of previous ages;\r\nOtherwise, the historical records would all have been destroyed.\r\nHow is it that vulgar Confucianists and men of a petty stripe\r\nCould perversely want to vilify O-[da] and Toyo-[tomi]?\r\nAnyone who has fixed his attention on reading the words inscribed,\r\nWould surely notice the enduring hoof-marks and wheel ruts east and west.\r\nI have come to lay my hands on the bridge and tarry here awhile;\r\nThe sound of the water against the pillars is speaking to me now.",
