  "text": "“Moon Rise on Autumn Fields” (Aki no ni tsuki tatsu) evokes the natural curves of plants on a field in the autumn. Like “Dwell in the Wind” (Kaze no yadori) of the previous year, this work also belongs to Uematsu’s current series “composition through lines” (sen ni yoru kōsei), but incorporates even stronger and more unrestricted lines. On first sight it seems that the bamboo is bending freely; however, each bamboo strip is stiffened with hemp that was glued to the underside before the entire piece was lacquered. By using this technique, Uematsu demonstrates a command of lacquer that is exceptional among bamboo artists.",
