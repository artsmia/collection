  "text": "A successful painter of Western-style oil paintings until his 50s, Suda Kokuta then began studying Zen Buddhism while also shifting his artistic focus to abstract painting and bold calligraphic works like this one. Many of his calligraphic works take Zen themes as their subjects and can be seen as Suda’s own explorations of these complex religious concepts. This work, for example, shows a single character, 虚 (pronounced kū), which means “emptiness,” a fundamental concept in Buddhism, which teaches that all existence is empty or void. That is to say that the way we tend to view the world and all the things in it—as concrete, unchanging, independent entities—is inaccurate. In the Buddhist view, all things are dependent on other things: this exists because that exists, and this arises when that arises.",
