  "text": "This lacquered box with a decorative reed design functions as storage for calligraphy utensils. The stalks meander around the box and overlap on the lid. The design is crafted in the maki-e technique by applying gold powder on the drawing in damp lacquer contrasting with the mother of pearl inlays, which are mounted in slight relief and give the surface a three-dimensional structure. The black lacquered interior has an insert furnished with a silver water dropper and a rubbing stone for ink, decorated in the same color as the surface of the box and embellished with gold.",
