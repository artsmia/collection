  "text": "Qin Guan (Shaoyou, 1049–c.1100) was a Chinese poet and author of this ode to bamboo, a plant that was respected by Chinese scholar-sages for bending but not breaking as well as its perseverance through winter.\r\nBeian starts the scroll with the title written in clerical script and then continues with the text in cursive script—typical of how such scrolls were written in China. They were generally rendered with a wet brush, and the differences between the scripts are clearly apparent here: the title characters are in a square, evenly balanced form while the cursive characters show the rapid movement of the brush.",
