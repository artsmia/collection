  "text": "Tiny buildings and figures indicate the huge scale of the mountains in this painting. The peaks fade into distant mists, a technique called atmospheric perspective, adding to the imposing effect. \r\nPhilosophers use many metaphors to explain the nature of the Dao, or “way, ” of Daoism because it is difficult to grasp, and its essence is impossible to translate into any language. Water is the natural and physical element most closely resembling the Dao. Therefore, the concept of the Dao can be understood and appreciated by watching the flow of water, as figures in this painting are doing.",
