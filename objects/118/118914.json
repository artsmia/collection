  "text": "The scholar Zhou Xingsi (470–521) is the author of the Thousand Character Classic (Qianziwen), a text used as a primer for schoolchildren learning Chinese characters. Each one of the thousand characters is used only once. The artist Shizuma created this teaching book by beginning the first volume with a double-page of elements that recur frequently in calligraphy. The characters are at first clearly defined and nicely proportioned—adequate for an instructive book. Later, however, he moves away from standard script to using wriggling lines and finally seal script.",
