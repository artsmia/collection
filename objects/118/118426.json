  "text": "Combining ink washes and meticulous brushwork in ink and bright colors like red and green, Sō Shiseki created this realistic image of a rooster standing under a flowering tree. The style is typical of the Nagasaki school of painters, of which Sō Shiseki was a leading member. A native of Japan’s capital, Edo (present-day Tokyo), Shiseki traveled to the far western port city of Nagasaki in the 1750s to study with Song Ziyuan (d. 1760), a Chinese painter who taught Qing dynasty Chinese-style bird-and-flower painting to Japanese painters. Sō Shiseki is credited with popularizing this style on his return to Edo, where he trained numerous followers.",
