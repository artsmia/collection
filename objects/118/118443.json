  "text": "Many Buddhist deities are believed to be accompanied by groups of assorted attendants and guardians. In devotional paintings or in sculptural groupings installed on Buddhist altars, they appear beside or around the main deity. This fierce-looking figure is Makora, one of twelve protective deities known as the Twelve Divine Generals (jūni shinshō) who accompany the Healing Buddha, Yakushi Nyorai, to whom the faithful pray for release from suffering. Each of the Divine Generals is said to represent one of twelve vows made by the Healing Buddha to heal the sick and ignorant and guide them on the path to enlightenment.",
