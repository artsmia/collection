  "text": "Kano Yukinobu closely adhered to the ink-painting styles developed by his better-known older brother, Kano Motonobu (1476–1559), second-generation head of the Kano house. Although Yukinobu never took a leading position in the studio, he participated with his older brother and other Kano painters on numerous commissions. This painting of a hawk, perched on the branch of an old tree and possibly eyeing some prey below, might have appealed to one of the Kano house’s military patrons. The hawk’s feathers, meticulously rendered in fine brushwork over various shades of ink wash, are a demonstration of Yukinobu’s skill in the painting of birds, a key subject in the Kano repertoire.",
