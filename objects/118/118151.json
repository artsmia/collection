  "text": "This painting portrays Life-prolonging Jizō, one of many forms of the bodhisattva Jizō to whom believers would pray for a long life. Shown lost in thought, seated in a relaxed pose upon a rock in the midst of a swirling sea, Jizō is attended by two young boys below—the red figure at left is Shōaku, the Administrator of Evil, and the white figure at right is Shōzen, the Administrator of Good. Life-prolonging Jizō can also manifest in a wrathful form as the Immovable Wisdom King. A painting of the Immovable Wisdom King made around the same time.",
