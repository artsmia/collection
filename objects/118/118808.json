  "text": "William Edmondson was the first African American artist to be honored with a solo exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, in 1937. A self-taught artist from Tennessee, he felt a calling from God to carve stone sculptures. The subjects of his work were often biblical, inspired by his Christian faith and by the burial art in black cemeteries. He especially favored Mary and Martha, the crucified Christ, angels, and various animals. Ram is a characteristic work.",
