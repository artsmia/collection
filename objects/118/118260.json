  "text": "Various insects explore the twisting vines, blooming yellow flowers, and curving contours of the hanging sponge gourds (loofahs) in this painting. Sponge gourds were brought to Japan from China and cultivated for multiple uses, including as food, cosmetics, and medicine. The dried fibrous interior was also used as a sponge or woven into sandals.\r\nNakabayashi Chikkei was the son of Nakabayashi Chikutō, a nanga (Chinese-style) painter. Earlier in his career Chikkei primarily painted ink landscapes, staying faithful to his father’s style. Beginning in his thirties, he experimented with different workshop styles and expanded his repertoire to include studies of nature, as reflected in this painting.",
