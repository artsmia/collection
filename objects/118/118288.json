  "text": "Hori Ichirō is renowned for his distinctive wood-fired vessels, particularly his exquisite white and gray shino and seto teabowls. He employs extended, low-heat firings that coax out the clay’s deep reddish hues beneath thick, creamy glazes. Hori conducts his kiln firings only twice annually, shaping forms that evolve over extended periods of contemplation.",
