  "text": "“Bring the Qin” 抱琴, written by Nakai with a relatively dry brush, refers to the final line of a poem by the Tang dynasty literatus Li Bai (701–762). The qin is a seven string instrument that is plucked. Li Bai’s poem, entitled “Drinking with a Hermit in the Mountains,” reads:\r\nTwo of us drinking together as mountain blossoms open;\r\nOne cup, another cup, still one more cup—\r\nI’m feeling a bit drunk and the time has come for you to depart,\r\nBut tomorrow morning, if you like, come again and bring the qin!",
