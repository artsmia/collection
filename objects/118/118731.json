Nakae’s poem, entitled “Drinking with a Hermit in the Mountains” reads:\r\n\r\nTwo of us drinking together as mountain blossoms open;\r\nOne cup, another cup, still one more cup—\r\nI’m feeling a bit drunk and the time has come for you to depart,\r\nBut tomorrow morning, if you like, come again and bring the qin!\r\n",
