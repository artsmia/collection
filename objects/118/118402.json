  "text": "Tanaka used the same method to sculpt this work as he did for the red, shiny The Tactile Memory: Floral Impression. However, the appearance of this work is very different. He ground the surface of the black outer layer unevenly in order to expose glimpses of the brown base layers and is therefore missing the shiny, polished finish.",
