  "text": "Tanaka Nobuyuki studied lacquer at the Tokyo University of the Arts but teaches today at Kanazawa College of Art. In the 1990s he created three-dimensional works using dry lacquer on which he intentionally left the texture of hemp cloth. During the same period, he also developed works that were polished like a mirror. More recently, he has concentrated on pure form, exploring new dimensions in the ancient medium of lacquer.",
