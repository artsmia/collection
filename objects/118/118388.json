  "text": "These screens show the landscape around the foot of Mount Heng in China’s Hunan province, commonly called the South Mountain and still known today for its beautiful scenery. Mount Heng is considered one of the Five Great Mountains. Kōtei began his artistic training at 12, when he studied Western and Japanese painting or nihonga. In 1916 he resigned from his post as a professor at the Tokyo School of Fine Arts (now the Tokyo University of the Arts) and embarked on a five-year journey through China and Korea. \r\n(2013.31.186.1-.2)",
