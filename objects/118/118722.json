  "text": "Ema Saikō was an outstanding female literatus of her time who was undertaking Chinese studies and arts. She wrote this Chinese-style poem on elegant blue paper with a delicate design of bracken.\r\n\r\nAs I become half a hundred, I begin to understand past mistakes;\r\nSlowly, slowly, my intentions have been thwarted.\r\nCranes are tall, ducks short—it is not humans who made them so.\r\nFish leap, hawks soar—all following the course of nature.\r\nMy desires have faded away like spring snow, Old friends have vanished like stars at dawn.\r\nIn the end, there is no use in potions for longevity, I only love to paint bamboo, its verdure reflected on my robe.",
