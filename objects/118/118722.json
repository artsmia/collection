  "text": "As I become half a hundred, I begin to understand past mistakes; Slowly, slowly, my intentions have been thwarted. Cranes are tall, ducks short—it is not humans who made them so. Fish leap, hawks soar—all following the course of nature. My desires have faded away like spring snow, Old friends have vanished like stars at dawn. In the end, there is no use in potions for longevity, I only love to paint bamboo, its verdure reflected on my robe.",
