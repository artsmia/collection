  "text": "Teahouses and traditional Japanese houses have built-in recessed display spaces, called tokonoma. The tokonoma is usually decorated with a hanging scroll, flower arrangement, and small objects. For a tea ceremony, the host would meditate on the participants and occasion to create a special collection of objects to commemorate the event. In this particular display, both objects allude to moonlight: the fan features a poem about “the evening moon,” and the tea caddy is made from the “night-glow shell” (green turban) sea snail.",
