  "text": "<span>The lacquer artist Yamamura Shinya inlaid thin, overlapping strips of turban shell to create a kaleidoscopic stripe motif. To a lesser extent, inlays of mother-of-pearl or abalone shell are common on Japanese lacquer either as an applique (<i>haritsuke</i>), or digging into the substrate to create a hollowed out spot (<i>umekomi</i>). The lid of this tea caddy is decorated with a technique known as <i>gyōbu-hirame</i> which has a scale-like pattern of gold foil over a <i>nashiji</i> ground (lit. pear-skin ground) of finer gold flakes. A <i>nashiji</i> ground is found on the inside and bottom, completing the lavish decoration.</span>",
