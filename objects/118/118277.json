  "text": "The living lacquer artist Yamamura Shinya inlaid thin, overlapping strips of turban shell to create a kaleidoscopic stripe motif. To a lesser extent, inlays of mother-of-pearl or abalone shell are common on Japanese lacquer either as an applique (haritsuke), or digging into the substrate to create a hollowed out spot (umekomi). The lid of the tea caddy (natsume) is decorated with a scale-like pattern of gold foil over a nashiji ground, a technique known as gyōbu-hirame. A nashiji ground is found on the inside and bottom, completing the lavish decoration.",
