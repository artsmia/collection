  "text": "The tiger is one of the most richly symbolic subjects of East Asian art. It is among the twelve animals of the zodiac, and appears in reference to Daoist, Buddhist, and folk legend, often paired with other symbolic subjects such as bamboo or dragons. Saeki Gantai’s screens feature a pair of white tigers, thought to be the most noble of their kind and particularly auspicious. The tiger on the left screen frolics beside a waterfall, while a second tiger watches from the right, curiously gnawing on a pine tree. Gantai was the son and successor of Saeki Ganku (1749/56–1838), the founder of the Kishi school, which is known for its vigorous depictions of animals, particularly tigers. Here, rough and energetic brushstrokes bring his subjects to life.",
