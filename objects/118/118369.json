  "text": "This fruit basket, handwoven from strips of lacquered bamboo, takes the shape of an open folding fan. The artist used a type of bamboo known as <I>madake</I> (literally, “true bamboo”), the most common form of bamboo, long prized in East Asia for its strength and flexibility. The intricate weave and embellished form are characteristic of <I>karamono</I>, or “Chinese-style, ” basketry, a style rooted in traditional Chinese bamboo-work, examples of which were in Japan since ancient times.  \r\n\r\nSuemura Shōbun was born in Osaka, where he became the only apprentice of Yamamoto Chikuryūsai I (1868–1950). When his teacher died, Suemura became an independent artist until he was drafted to work in a factory during World War II (1939¬–45). In 1951, his work was accepted to the Japan Fine Arts Exhibition (Nitten), the first of thirty-six such exhibitions in which he showed work. This basket was submitted to the Nitten exhibition held in 1957.",
