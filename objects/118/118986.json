  "text": "Kay Sekimachi was already a groundbreaking fiber artist and weaver, having studied with creative fiber artists Trude Guermonprez and Jack Lenor Larsen, when she married wood turner Bob Stocksdale in 1972.  By that time, she had been weaving sculptural woven monofilament forms that gracefully helped define the possibilities of three-dimensional fiber art.  \r\n\r\nIn the early 1990s she began to form paper vessels, emphasizing translucency, using Stocksdale’s exotic turned wood bowls as her template. These have been shown together as “Marriage in Form” sets. Although the sets emphasize the different qualities of each medium through the same form, Sekimachi’s single paper bowls, such as this one made from repurposed hornet’s nest paper, allow the viewer to concentrate on the ephemeral form and material more completely.  \r\n",
