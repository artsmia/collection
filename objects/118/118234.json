  "text": "Worlds of Things comprises three volumes, each with 20 compositions. Printed with a wide palette of colors, including gold and silver, the book was intended to stand on its own as art while also fi tting into the traditional genre of pattern books, providing inspiration for designs. The book is bound as an album, allowing the illustration to extend across two pages. Sekka’s designs focus on a range of traditional themes, from classical literature like The Tale of Genji to landscapes and animals. Due to the ample use of pigment,\r\nthe production cost of a book like this one was high.\r\n",
