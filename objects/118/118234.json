  "text": "This work is comprised of three woodblock printed albums, each containing 20 double-page compositions that include popular motifs such as deer among pine trees and waves. The images form an elegant balance between the principals of modernism and the tradition of the decorative style called Rinpa, which Kamisaka Sekka had studied extensively and brought to new life in his work. Though the albums are intended as printed art rather than a book of patterns, a number of the designs reappear on three-dimensional works like trays and lacquer boxes, as well as in Sekka’s later paintings. The themes featured in this collection are predominantly classical, such as the beauty of nature, figures in traditional attire, or motifs drawn from classical literature, like The Tale of Genji.",
