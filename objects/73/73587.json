Often called the \"Raphael of Flowers,\" Redouté set a new standard in the field for his sumptuous renditions of single blooms and entire bouquets. Redouté's paintings, like those of other botanical artists, were translated into engravings and painstakingly finished by hand. These exquisite prints, most executed by French printmakers, came to the MIA's Department of Prints and Drawings from the collection of Dwight and Helen Minnich, who had a special f",
