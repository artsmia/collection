  "text": "Intent on Christianizing the pagan sky, a Catholic lawyer, Julius Schiller, dedicated himself to recasting the constellations in terms of the bible. The result is the charming 1627 atlas Coelum Stellatum Christianum. In this print, the constellation Cepheus, the mythological King of Ethiopia (husband of Cassiopeia and father of Andromeda) is transformed into Saint Stephen. Although Schiller failed to replace the classical narratives associated with the constellations, many subsequent atlases, such as Andreas Cellarius's celebrated Harmonia Macrocosmica, included his Christian star charts (one exhibited nearby).",
