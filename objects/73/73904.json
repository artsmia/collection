  "text": "A Catholic lawyer and amateur astronomer, Julius Schiller created a celestial atlas that substituted mythological constellations for Christian ones. The ancient constellation Argo Navis, for example, became Noah's Ark. Here Noah peeks out to see a dove returning with good news. Although Schiller produced a first-rate compendium, he failed to alter the course of astronomical nomenclature.",
