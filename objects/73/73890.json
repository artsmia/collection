  "text": "Jonah spent three days and nights in the whale, actually a large fish (Jonah 1:17), usually portrayed as a dragon-faced, mythological ketos. From early times, artists linked Jonah's ejection from the fish with Christ's Resurrection, which is one reason the theme was so popular. This woodcut shows the naked prophet being delivered onto dry land, then happily scurrying away, as if reborn, in the extra episode in the corner.",
