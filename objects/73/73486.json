  "text": "Since Robert Thornton chose his illustrators for their artistry rather than their knowledge of plants, his Temple of Flora is of little botanical value. It is, however, a monument to Romantic sensibilities. Thornton wanted each specimen to be seen in its natural environment. Of this scene, he said, \"In the Canada Lily there is expressed the shade it delights in, with a sky whose clouds yet contain snow in their bosom.\"",
