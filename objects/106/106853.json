  "text": "The Tokuda Yasokichi family of potters produced traditional porcelains in Ishikawa Prefecture using the typical five kutani glazes: green, blue, yellow, purple, and red. In 1973, Yasokichi III broke with the family style begun by his grandfather and invented a technique that allowed him to use the kutani glazes to create a starburst effect. The mesmerizing, brilliant glazes became his trademark and earned him recognition as Living National Treasure in 1997. Today, Yasokichi III’s daughter Junko represents the family’s fourth generation.",
