  "text": "Jordan is a self-taught wood turner and teacher who travels both nationally and internationally to demonstrate his craft.  He enjoys working with discarded, often damaged wood that he finds at landfills and construction sites.  He turns his pieces on the lathe while the wood is still green, using tools of his own design.  This piece shows the textured surface treatment that is Jordan's trademark.  He creates the rough texture by hand, using small tools in a process that can take up to three weeks to complete.  Jordan finds inspiration in nature and the arts and cultures he experiences on his travels; his lotus flower form here could be seen as a reference to Asian art.",
