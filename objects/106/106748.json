  "text": "Fennell attributes his love of wood to his early experiences in his father's basement workshop in Beverly, Massachusetts.  After earning Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees in engineering, Fennell moved to California, where he worked on the Apollo space program.  In 1970, Fennell took an adult education class in wood turning.  Following this introduction, he taught himself more advanced turning techniques, focusing on the miniature vessel form.  These miniatures demonstrate his precision and skill, as they are beautifully proportioned and turned to an astounding thinness.  In recent years, Fennell has become increasingly interested in texture, creating new surface treatments for his vessels through carving, sanding, and piercing.",
