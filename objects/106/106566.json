  "text": "Jaune Quick-to-See Smith combines her Native aesthetic with abstraction found in Western art. She adeptly mixes text and imagery to inject subtle hints or overt references to subjects she wants her viewers to consider. The lithographs in Smith’s four-part Survival series are named for Native social models that have given Indigenous people resilience, allowing them to survive the severe disruption brought about by colonialism. The other subjects in the series are Wisdom/Knowledge, Nature/Medicine, and Tribe/Community.",
