  "text": "Angelino's approach to wood turning synthesizes his love of both technology and nature.  While Angelino holds a Ph.D. in Aeronautical Engineering, he is also a self-taught botanist and wood turner.  His pieces combine branches, roots, knots, and other types of wood that other wood turners might discard.  This piece is an especially good example of Angelino's patchwork style, in which he adheres small fragments of wood together before turning the entire piece to produce a thin and almost weightless vessel.  This emphasizes the interaction of the translucent wood with light, a major focus of his work.",
