  "text": "Joshua Johnson was the first-known black portrait painter in American art history. Born to a black slave, Johnson was purchased from his owner by his white father for 25 pounds in 1764, and subsequently gained his freedom after completing a blacksmithing apprenticeship. Once free, Johnson chose a different path and was not shy about his abilities, as is revealed by a newspaper ad declaring himself to be a “self-taught genius.” He found a ready clientele among the farmers and merchants of Maryland and Virginia. Richard John Cock, the son of Elizabeth and Captain John Cock (a privateer during the War of 1812), died at age 9 in 1817. This posthumous portrait shows him pointing to a moth -- a symbol of his untimely death.",
