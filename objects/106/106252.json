  "text": "Primarily a figurative artist, Wolfgang Buchta was strongly influenced by the work of Egon Schiele, Gustav Klimpt, Oskar Kokoschka, and other Austrian Art Nouveau and Jugendstil artists of the early decades of the twentieth century. Of these artists, Schiele's influence on his work is perhaps the most marked. Buchta's printmaking specialty is etching and aquatint and nearly all of his artist's books feature intaglio illustrations. The complexity of his book productions, the choice of illustrative techniques, and the fact that he prints his own editions, results in projects that are both technically challenging and extremely time consuming.",
