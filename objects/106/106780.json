  "text": "After opening his workshop in 1946 in Berkeley, California, Bob Stocksdale became one of the most prolific and influential artists in the field of turned wood.  The strong appeal of his Asian- and Scandinavian-inspired tableware earned Stocksdale a place on the shelves of California's finest department stores, as well as the reputation for being the first turner able to support himself by making bowls. \r\n\r\nStocksdale became a master of form and let the material determine the shape, texture, and finish of each object in order to use the grain patterns to greatest advantage.  Along with friend and fellow turner James Prestini, Stocksdale was a regularly featured artist at the Museum of Modern Art in the early 1950s.",
