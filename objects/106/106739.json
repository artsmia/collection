  "text": "Bryant grew up in West Cornwall, England, and from an early age was exposed to the abstract aesthetic of the St. Ives colony of artists.  He began turning wood at the age of thirteen, and went on to study with an industrial wood turner.  Bryant's pieces were turned while green, which allowed them to change and warp naturally as they dried.  In his turning, Bryant strove to create perfect bowls with pure forms and extremely thin walls; this piece is a testament to his success in both respects.  In recent years, Bryant has turned to abstract painting.",
