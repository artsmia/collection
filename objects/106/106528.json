  "text": "Approaching Storm shows an idealized landscape—here, the White Mountains of New Hampshire. While Fisher’s meticulous rendering of the land and people makes us focus on what he painted, not how he painted it, the brushstrokes forming the clouds are quite obvious. The dark mass threatening a storm hints at Fisher’s role in setting the stage for the Hudson River school, previewing the Romantic approach to landscape championed by Albert Bierstadt and others.",
