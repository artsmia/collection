  "text": "In addition to turning wood, Stewart creates and markets wood turning tools to other artists.  Most notably, he developed a hollowing system that allows the turner to hollow out a deep vessel through a small opening.  Though this piece is small, it shows Stewart's favorite form:  a deep vesel, widening toward the top, with a natural edge.",
