  "text": "Since 1979, the spiral form has dictated much of Hunter's work.  Both Rhythms in Chaos and Bahia Blossom are from series he still pursues today, with carved flutes creating a voluptuousness of form.  From here Hunter started to open up his vessels by carving through the flutes, introducing voids, for example with Retusa Phantom.",
