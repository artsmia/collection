  "text": "Key first remembers working with wood at the age of seven, when he spent his time whittling and carving.  He worked as an industrial wood turner prior to becoming a full time wood artist in 1973.  Key is credited with advancing the reputation of wood turning as an art form in Britain; he writes and lectures on the subject and founded The Woodturners Association of Great Britain in 1987.\r\n\r\nThe <I>Pagoda Box</I>, a collection of mini-boxes vertically stacked, is an example of Key's most exquisite work (he also produces simpler household goods for everyday use).  Key strives to create elegant and integrated forms.  He writes, I am a great believer in the object as a whole; all elements should be in sympathetic harmony with one another, not a disjointed assemblage of different ones.",
