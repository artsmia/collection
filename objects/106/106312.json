  "text": "Binoculars are not a new instrument--early European records record their development in the 17th century--but the \"binocular Micro-Telescope\" combined the magnifcation of a telescope with stereoscopic vision in one well-made instrument. Essentially two telescopes mounted together, it promised good field, definition, depth of focus, and remarkable perspective. \r\nA reviewer advised using the lower magnification of 14 until necessary to add the higher magnification eyepieces that upped the performance to 22 and 28 maginfication. High-performance with or without a stand, for landscape views or stargazing, they were the type of “field glasses” used during World War I. The central large ring is for adjusting overall focus, while the eye pieces can be adjusted individually.",
