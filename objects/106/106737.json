  "text": "Necklaces like this one were treasured objects in traditional Hawaiian society, worn by both men and women, and preserved among families for generations. The hook-shaped pendant is carved of ivory, very rare until brought to the islands by trade in the early nineteenth century. Its graceful curving form holds a number of symbolic associations, including connections with fishhooks, chiefly authority, and the gods. The human hair forming the collar was donated by the friends and family of the owner to show their affection and support. It was then painstakingly plaited into one extremely long, fine single cord, which was then looped into bundles at each side.",
