  "text": "This work is a copy of a tapestry Helena Hernmarck wove in 1963, the same year she graduated from art school in her native Stockholm, Sweden. But it was soon lost—with several other early works—in a fire that destroyed her father’s house. The following year, Hernmarck re-wove Sun Worshippers just before moving to Canada to begin her professional career in North America. Today, Hernmarck lives and works in Connecticut.",
