  "text": "New York artist William Murray made numerous family registers, particularly for British-American families. Here Murry  documents the family of Daniel Contryman, born in 1785.  The style is an interesting hybrid of Pennsylvania Dutch (German) fraktur or broken writing style and traditional New England family registers. A fabulous example of American folk art, the register remained in the family until it was gifted to the MIA in 2008.",
