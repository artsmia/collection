  "text": "Matt is the youngest of the three generations of Moulthrop wood turners (he is Philip's son and Ed's grandson).  Matt apprenticed in his grandfather's workshop in Atlanta, where he learned to use local woods to create elegant vessel forms.  Though each Moulthrop uses subtle details to distinguish his pieces, the three men's collective works are cohesive and easily identifiable because of their generous vessel forms and their attention to the wood's grain and surface treatment.  Ed, Philip, and Matt also share a similar creative process:  the wood is turned while green, then treated with polyethylene glycol (to prevent warping and to emphasize the grain) and allowed to dry for six months before it is turned again, sanded, and coated with a high gloss epoxy finish.",
