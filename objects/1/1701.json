  "text": "Considered to be one of the latest pieces from ancient Egypt in Miaâ€™s collection, this bronze statuette of the goddess Isis dates back to the 1st century CE, well into the time of Roman and Greek rule of Egypt. Isis is portrayed in Greco-Roman attire: flowing robes and sandals. Her stance, mid-stride with an outstretched hand, contrasts with the more rigid representations of her in traditional ancient Egyptian sculpture.",
