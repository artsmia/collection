  "text": "Considered to be one of the latest pieces from ancient Egypt in Mia’s collection, this bronze statuette of the goddess Isis dates back to the 1st century CE, well into the time of Roman and Greek rule of Egypt. Isis is portrayed in Greco-Roman attire: flowing robes and sandals. Her stance, mid-stride with an outstretched hand, contrasts with the more rigid representations of her in traditional ancient Egyptian sculpture.",
