  "text": "In 19th-century America, a growing wealthy class desired artworks that reflected a life of leisure and abundance. Still lifes and genre paintings filled the bill, simultaneously mirroring and augmenting the material richness of American homes.\r\n\r\nTrained as a porcelain painter in his native Germany, Severin Roesen became a renowned painter of still lifes after immigrating to the United States in 1848.\r\n\r\nRecent conservation of this picture was made possible by a generous contribution from Douglas and Mary Olson through the Adopt-a-Painting program.\r\n",
