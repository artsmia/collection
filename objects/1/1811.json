  "text": "Saint Roch, born of noble French parents at the end of the thirteenth century, was the patron saint of the plague-stricken. Before he was twenty years of age, he disposed of his riches and henceforth devoted himself to nursing the sick. Saint Roch is frequently depicted with cockleshell, wallet and staff in the habit of a pilgrim, sometimes lifting his robe to reveal a plague spot on his thigh. His faithful dog brought him bread when he retreated, stricken with the plague, to the wilderness. ",
