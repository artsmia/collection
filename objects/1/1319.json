  "text": "Bodhisattvas are divine beings who deny their own passage into Nirvana to help others achieve salvation. In its serene simplicity, this sculpture typifies an early style of Buddhist sculpture that flowered in Japan after Buddhist teachings were introduced between 500 and 600. The full oval face and childlike proportions are related to Chinese and Korean prototypes. Small gilt-bronze statues such as this were easily transportable, thus helping to spread Buddhism and Buddhist images throughout Asia.\r\n",
