  "description": "This weapon displays the assymetrically placed tang and the strongly beaked, crested head of a bird that was a ubiquitous motif in the bronze art of Yin-time. The details of the bird's head are in rather heavy thread relief. This piece is similar to Karlgren Number 81, plate 99, but is of bronze throughout. Patina green",
