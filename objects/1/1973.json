  "text": "“The portrait is a form of biography. Its purpose is to inform now and to record for history.”—Arnold Newman\r\n\r\nSince the late 1930s some of the most outstanding personalities of the 20th century, from celebrities to politicians, were photographed by Arnold Newman. In 1939, Newman first met photographer Alfred Stieglitz at “An American Place” in New York City, a hot spot seventeenth-floor gallery for young modern artists that Stieglitz ran. Taken there is this portrait of Stieglitz and his spouse at that time, painter Georgia O’Keeffe. Wearing a cape and with a book on his hands, Stieglitz glares at the camera forefront; as opposed to O’Keeffe who is captured with her eyes cast down.",
