  "description": "The principle surface displays a rectangular field of interlocked T's on a ground of squared spirals framed on three sides by rows of spikes. Scored flanges at the four corners of the vessel are supplemented in the upper belt by additional flanges which thus divide it into eight panels. Antithetical, long-tailed birds flank the short flanges forming the central ridge of a rudimentary t'ao-t'ieh mask. Hanging blades appear on the cylindrical legs, and disfigured dragons in flat relief on the outer surface of the upright handles. Patina green",

  "text": "The living offered their ancestors sacrificial food in this <I>fangding,</I> a raised boxlike vessel on four columnar legs. Notably, all the linear patterns on this small vessel have been filled with a black carbonaceous substance, to give added emphasis to the graphic designs. Though not widespread, this technique can be found in other late Shang and early Western Zhou bronzes.",
