  "text": "This remnant of a marble faun is most likely a Roman copy of an earlier Greek bronze sculpture, part of a group known as \"The Invitation to Dance.\" Its torso exemplifies the beauty and high level of realism that the Greeks and Romans sought in their representations of the human form. The precise anatomical detail of this male nude offers a fascinating contrast of artistic style to the modern reclining figure, lying nearby on the floor and made almost two thousand years later after the Roman torso.",
