  "text": "According to family legend, this clock once stood in the Boston house of the Revolutionary War patriot Samuel Adams (1722-1803).  Adams is best known for confronting the Royal Governor, Thomas Hutchinson, over the Boston Massacre of 1770, and demanding that British troops leave Boston.  Adams inherited a successful malt-producing company, the inspiration for today's Samuel Adams Brewing Company based in Boston.",
