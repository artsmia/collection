  "text": "Daedalus, the architect, inventor, and craftsman of Greek legend, is shown attaching wings to the back of his son, Icarus, and pointing upward and away. According to the most influential version of the ancient myth as it is recounted by Ovid, Daedalus fabricated wings of feathers and wax in order to escape by air from the island of Crete, where he and his son were held captive by King Minos. Disregarding his father’s advice, Icarus flew too close to the sun. The wax melted and he fell into the sea and drowned. The myth of Daedalus and Icarus has remained a popular parable about heeding one’s elders, the dangers of excessive ambition and pride, and the benefits and risks of technological progress.",
