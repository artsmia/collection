  "text": "The foreground of this painting depicts a village by the river. A few thatched huts stand near the water, windows open to expose the scenes within. In one hut, several people are enjoying a game of Weiqi, or Go. Behind, there appears to be a small restaurant with two travelers sitting and eating a meal. In the water, fishermen sit within a boat fishing. Up the river, a ferry has just arrived, with people disembarking onto the shore. Beyond the river, further in the distance, several small thatched huts are scattered among the green trees. \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the middle ground of the painting is shrouded by clouds and mist, and tall mountains rise dramatically into the sky. Several groups of temples are scattered on the mountaintop and in a mountainous valley, creating a sense of the otherworldly, spiritual world of Daoism and Buddhism. The painting exposes the contrast between busy secular life and the tranquil spiritual world by visually separating them with mist.",
