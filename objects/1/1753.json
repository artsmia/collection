  "description": "Buddha seated with legs crossed at the ankles. He wears a monk's diaphanous garment which covers only his right side. He is seated in a adamantine pose with the soles of his feet facing upward (as in early Gupta art). He assumes a gesture of exposition with his very long fingers. His face is excellently modelled with heavy eyelids, eyes looking downward and an enigmatic smile. His ears are large with long perforated lobes and he wears a tiered snail-like hairdo. Original and dark patina. Dvaravati style, Mon, Thailand. Cast in the lost wax process.",
