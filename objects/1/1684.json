  "art_champions_text": "Conservation cost: $5,960\r\n\r\nLingelbachâ€™s painting of Mary Magdalene requires both structural and cosmetic interventions. The tacking margins are too weak to support proper canvas tension and should be reinforced with a strip-lining. Strengthening the margins will also insure that the painting is securely attached to the stretcher and that the canvas draws can be eliminated.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the painting is marred by discolored varnish and conspicuous retouching that should be removed or reduced. Small tests indicate that cleaning would have dramatic results. Tests also suggest the multiple campaigns of retouching are more broadly applied than necessary. A more judicious use of inpainting will improve the appearance of the painting significantly.\r\n\r\nContact the Paintings Department at paintings@artsmia.org or (612) 870-3111 to Champion this artwork.",
