  "text": "This cinerary urn resembles a small building with pitched roof. The inscription attests that it contained the ashes of a man and a woman, possibly husband and wife, who were freed slaves:\r\n\r\nTo the divine shades of D(ecimus) Aemilius Chius and Hortensia Phebe\r\n\r\nThe ornamentation combines symbols related to death and resurrection. The garlands and fruit indicate regeneration and eternal life; the winged harpies on the front corners are fantastic creatures thought to carry off the souls of the dead; the eagles on the back corners represent man's spiritual ability to soar heavenwards. The central gorgon's head serves to ward off evil influence. The back is not decorated, as the urn would have been places in a niche inside a tomb.\r\n\r\nThis work was reassembled from fragments at an unknown date. Part of the right posterior corner of the base is a replacement. The gabled lid was probably carved in the 17th century. We would like to thank Prof. Alessandro Muscillo for this information.",
