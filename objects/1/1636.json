  "provenance": "Emile Gavet, Paris (until 1875; his sale Hotel Drouot, Paris, June 11-12, 1875, no. 59, for Fr 3,620). Edouard Otlet (until 1900; his sale, Hotel Drouot, Paris, December 17, 1900, no. 16, for Fr 15,000]; La Banque liégeoise, Liège (from 1900-at least 1903; deposited with Durand-Ruel, December 27, 1900, stock number 9,926, returned May 27, 1903);* sale, J. and A. Le Roy, Brussels, December 14, 1903, no. 1. [Knoedler, New York, until 1916; sold to Hill, April 10, 1916, for $11,500, Hill voucher no. 57702]; James J. Hill, St. Paul (April 10, 1916-d. May 29, 1916); by descent to his daughter, Mrs. Egil Boeckmann (until d. 1967; gave to MIA with 67.31.4)\r\n\r\n*It appears the work was held by Durand-Ruel while a court in Brussels mediated a financial dispute between Edouard Otlet and la Banque liégeoise. The court determined on July 30, 1903 that Otlet's art would be sold at Le Roy within six months to repay Otlet's debt to the bank.",
