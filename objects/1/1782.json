  "text": "This painting is a study for a much larger altarpiece in the chapel of Santa Lucia in the church of San Pietro Martire in Naples. The Madonna and Child, on a raised platform, give an audience to three Christian martyrs. Saints John (lower left) and Paul (wearing armor), brothers serving in the Roman army, were killed in 363 CE by the emperor known as Julian the Apostate. Saint Peter Martyr (1206â€“52), standing in shadow on the left, wears the robes of a Dominican friar and has a wound in his head, inflicted when heretics assassinated him.\r\n\r\nConservation of this picture was made possible by a generous contribution from Al and Dena Naylor through the Art Champions program.",
