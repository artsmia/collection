  "text": "The most important statue of Sakyamuni Buddha was a large sandalwood image commissioned by King Udhyana that was claimed to be a direct portrait of the historical Buddha. A sandalwood copy of the Udhyana Buddha was brought from India to China by the great pilgrim Kumarajiva in 405. The famous image resided in several monasteries until it was transferred to the newly built Da Shang Shou An Si temple in Beijing in 1289. The statue was immensely popular during the Yuan dynasty (1280-1368) and it is probable that this gilt bronze image is a copy of the sandalwood image in Beijing made during the 14th century.",
