  "text": "This example of well-ordered calligraphy is from chapter 54 of the Koran. It is written in kufic, the stiff, rectilinear script preferred for formal inscriptions, title colophons, and chapter headings. Black is used for the consonants and diacritical marks, red for vowels, and green and blue for reading marks. The gold disks with green centers mark the end of a single verse; the larger marginal half-disk, the end of the fifth verse; and the large round disk, the end of the thirtieth verse. These decorative \"stops\" were typically used to designate daily readings.",
