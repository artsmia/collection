  "text": "Autumn is the season of Bacchus, the ancient Roman god of wine, shown here as a life-size sculpture holding a chalice and a staff bearing clusters of grapes. In the distance, peasants labor in the vineyards. Autumn is also the season of the hunt. At the right, a young hunter offers game to a seated maiden, who responds by giving him a bird she has taken from its cage. A caged bird symbolizes virginity. Platzer refers here to the dangers of overindulgence, which can lead to uncontrollable passion, however subtly masked by elegant attire and graceful actions.",
