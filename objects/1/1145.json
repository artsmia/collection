  "description": "This ting represents the Huai style at its extreme point in the matter of the vessel shape. The tradition that in this style the body of the Ting is big and bulky in proportion to the extremely short, thin legs, is here carried to the ultimate degree. The high lid, its ring-shaped top capable of serving as a foot if the lid is inverted, is fully spherical in shape. The legs are very small and thin and display a t'ao-t'ieh with spiral horns on their upper parts. (The t'ao-t'ieh, all but extinct during Middle Chou, reappeared in the Huai Style Period). Dissolved dragon rigid ring handles are adorned with a row of cowries bordered by rope-patterned bands. On the top of the lid, a loosely twined cord pattern encloses a quartefoil with its central disk filled with granulation. Patina blue-green.",
