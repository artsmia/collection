  "text": "Argylls, which are said to have been named for the duke of Argyll, who disliked cold gravy, were first introduced in the 1760s. The sauce is kept warm by an inner liner filled with hot water. A hinged flap separates the hot water from the gravy and the spout is usually set low on the body so that fat in the sauce will rise to the surface and is not poured from the vessel.",
