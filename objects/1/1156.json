  "description": "Pole top with animal. This pole top, a companion to 50.46.92 varies only slightly in detail to it. The pose is almost identical, but the present animal is mounted on a low, domed base instead of a rather high cylindrical one, and its longer tail turns in and down in the manner displayed by the Northern Nomad animal style (Ordos) example in the museum of Far Eastern Antiquities in Stockholm (cf. Karlgren Number 65 and 66) Patina blue-green.",
