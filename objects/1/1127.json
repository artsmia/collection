  "description": "Both bowl and cover of this squat ding are richly decorated with broad horizontal belts of various patterns broad bands of interlaced volutes and angles, granulation and striation, as well as taotie masks placed upside down. The sides of the bent handles are incised with volutes, the face of the handles with volutes and angles. The knees of the short, thick legs are adorned with taotie-like masks. Three upright disks with flat, truncated projections at the top are affixed to the lid, which has a central medallion with a border of volutes and angles framing a wide band Huai heart-shaped blades. The low, rounded bottom of the bowl suggests Jincun as the possible provenance of this vessel. Patina grayed green with areas of sharp green.",
