  "text": "This working-class character was one of many ordinary Parisians painted by Manet in the 1860s. A year before making this portrait, Manet had traveled to Madrid, Spain, where he was reportedly \"enchanted\" by the naturalistic depictions of common people painted by Diego Velásquez in the 1600s. Manet emulated the Spanish master in his own series of everyday scenes while adding a modern twist: elevating the images to the impressive scale of a formal portrait. \r\n\r\nThis is a Louis XIV revival frame from the nineteenth century, a Gift of the Douglas and Mary Olson Frame Acquisition Fund. Frames of this style are characterized by their leaf and floral motif. Here these sculptural elements appear to be growing and reaching beyond the frame.",
