  "text": "In 1936, Rufino Tamayo moved to New York, where one of his closest friends, Mexican artist Miguel Covarrubias, introduced him to the rich cultural scene in Harlem. Whether this painting portrays an African American family from Harlem is uncertain, though. Tamayo often depicted characters with dark skin as a way to suggest mestizo or Indigenous ancestry. The figures’ masklike faces can be seen as an indication of the artist’s interest in ancient cultures, in his native Mexico and beyond.",
