  "text": "King John V of Portugal commissioned three paintings from Masucci which would eventually be transferred into mosaic for the Church of Saint Roque in Lisbon. The artist made small modelli, or preparatory works, of these paintings to send to the King for approval; The Annunciation is one. Masucci completed the full-size versions of these three paintings and shipped them to the King in 1747. The paintings were executed in mosaic in the chapel of St. John the Baptist within the Church by 1752.",
