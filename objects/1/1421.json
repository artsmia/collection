  "text": "In Paris, where he moved in 1906 from his native Italy, Amedeo Modigliani stood out from the ebullient avant-garde with his mysterious, long-necked portraits—paintings of arresting solemnity. In the years 1911 to 1913, he explored sculpture, creating a series of geometric heads in stone, inspired by African masks. Because of poor health, he soon abandoned the labor of direct carving, but it resurfaced in Female Bust in Red, along with memories from the art of the past. The forms are condensed in solid blocks, vigorous brushstrokes seem to mimic on paper the chisel’s blows, while the head bows with silent elegance in a modern echo of the Virgin Annunciate in Simone Martini’s Gothic Annunciation.",
