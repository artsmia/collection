  "text": "Paul Signac was an avid sailor who owned 32 boats and loved to travel. This landscape depicts tuna boats in the Groix harbor of Brittany, on the west coast of France. The sailboats are partaking in a century-old blessing ceremony, praying for a safe journey and bountiful catch. By juxtaposing complementary colorful dots alongside one another, Signac achieves an energetic effect in this lively yet harmonious composition. His mastery of the pointillist technique renders a luminous surface in the detailed mosaic.",
