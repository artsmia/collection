  "text": "Numerous depictions of the Xi Wangmu, or Queen Mother of the West, and her consort, King Father of the East, survive in the form of mirror decoration. On this mirror, the divine couple are accompanied by four fantastic beasts. Each sits on a throne carried on the back of a beast. The composition of the two divinities on opposite sides of the mirror, their most common arrangement, symbolizes the ancient Chinese philosophical concept of yin and yang (opposing, contrary forces in the world are actually interdependent and inseparable) that flourished at that time, as well as their residence in the West and East respectively. Mirrors decorated with divine images and celestial talismans had symbolic value for the Han dynasty followers of Daoism. A practitioner who possessed the mirror could hope for eternal life or protection from evil.",
