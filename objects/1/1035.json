  "description": "The decor of incised lines and spirals on this animal recall those on the Middle Chou water buffalo, Karlgren Number 90 (50.46.113). It should be noted, however, that the spirals on shoulders and hind quarters area here centered by a raised ring with turquoise inlay. These decor figures might point to a similar epoch were it not for certain details that are a clear indication of a later date. The rope pattern around the eyes, on the eyebrows, the fetlocks, and on the dragon decorating the socket, as well as the granulation on the front of the ears and the head of the dragon, point to the Early Huai Style Period. The socket on the back suggests that the tiger served as a podium. Patina bluish- green.",
