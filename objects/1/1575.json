  "text": "Jan Both was born in Utrecht, a city south of Amsterdam in the Netherlands. He studied painting in Rome between 1638 and 1641, and was heavily influenced by Claude Lorrain, a French painter who moved to Rome a couple decades before Both and spent most of his working life there. The golden sunsets for which Claude was especially celebrated are recalled in this work, painted by Both long after his return to Utrecht.",
