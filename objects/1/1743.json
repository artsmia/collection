  "text": "Standing Girl is the largest known drawing from Egon Schiele’s short but prolific career. His life played out against the backdrop of Sigmund Freud’s studies of the mind and intense debates about the treatment of human sexuality in the arts. Here Schiele combined confident mastery of line with unflinching examination of psychological complexity, of inward reality and outward appearance. He struck a calculated balance between corruption and purity, between the figure’s clawlike hands and her virginal, downcast eyes.",
