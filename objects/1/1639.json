  "text": "This landscape evokes Biblical stories of the Apocalypse, which foretold Christ's second coming. In the foreground, a woman in blue kneels before a tall figure with streaming golden hair, possibly Christ, while in the background two horsemen of the Apocalypse vault a fence.\r\n\r\nAs a pioneer of abstract painting, Vassily Kandinsky thought art could make inner truths visible. An \"improvisation,\" he said, was \"a largely unconscious, spontaneous expression of inner character,\" or \"non-material (i.e., spiritual) nature.\" Kandinsky wanted painting to function like music, using colors and forms like melodies and rhythms—abstractly—to summon emotion.\r\n\r\nFrame: Gift of Galerie Thomas, Munich, Germany.",
