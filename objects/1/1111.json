  "description": "The cylindrical base of this bird is lower than that of the companion pole top (50.46.91). In other respects the scored flanges, S-shaped horns, and openings in the body, it is very similar. This example has a pellet in the body, however, thus serving as a rattle -- or a bell. Patina grey-green.",
