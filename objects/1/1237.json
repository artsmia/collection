  "text": "Once regarded as the work of the German silversmith Hans Petzoldt (1551-1633), this cup and cover are now known to date from the late 19th century. Exotic objects like ostrich eggs were treasured by collectors in the 16th and 17th centuries. In the late 19th century, these rarities were prized so highly that a market for fakes sprang up.",
