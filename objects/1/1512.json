  "text": "Saint Romuald, born in 950, founded a strict order of monks who valued austerity and meditation. His white robe shows that his order was related to the better-known Benedictines, and his book and staff, made from reeds, speak to his wisdom and commitment to living simply. The fine details of his expression and subtle shadows on his robe are hallmarks of the painter Fra Angelico, who was himself a devout friar.",
