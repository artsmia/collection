  "text": "The Buddhist ritual object known in Japan as rinpō ultimately derives from an ancient Indian weapon known as cakra, one of the seven treasures of the Universal Monarch, or Cakra-vartin (Wheel Turner). The magical power of the cakra was believed to scatter the enemies of Cakra-vartin in all directions. In Buddhism, it came to symbolize the historic Buddha's ability to dispel opposing doctrines through his teachings. Thus, his discourse is known as \"Turning the Wheel of Law.\" This wheel is comprised of eight vajra spokes, symbolizing the Buddha's Eightfold Path, radiating out from a center lotus, emblematic of purity.",
