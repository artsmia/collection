  "text": "This is an audacious work of sculpture. Matisse took a casual pose often seen in paintings—a reclining nude with raised arms—and swung the figure out into space, twisted into a 3-D posture seemingly without a central axis. The erect arms, neck, and head provide balance for the unsupported torso.",
