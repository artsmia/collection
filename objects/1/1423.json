  "text": "Picasso took an interest in classical art, specifically that of the Hellenistic period (323–31 BCE), such as the Venus de Milo. Here he imitated a sculptural form on a two-dimensional surface by modeling with light and shadow. He deliberately distorted the forms of the body, foreshortening the figure and compressing space and depth. The woman’s dark, wavy hair, serene expression, languid pose, and draped dress all reflect Hellenistic Greek influence. Isolation against a barren background accentuates her massiveness, making her presence overpowering.",
