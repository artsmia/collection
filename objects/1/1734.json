  "text": "This angel and the one next to it hold symbols of the Passion—the events associated with Jesus Christ’s suffering and death. The tablet inscribed “Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews” in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin was placed on the cross, above Jesus. The angels belonged to a series of twelve carrying symbols of the Passion, created for a patron who later became archbishop of Naples. Vouet worked in Rome from 1612 to 1627, mainly on religious commissions. The angels were among the last works he painted before returning to France. In Paris, he helped introduce French artists to the Baroque style: high drama, rich color, intense light, and dark shadows.",
