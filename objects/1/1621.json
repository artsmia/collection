  "text": "While Judith looks heavenward for guidance, she and her maid, Abra, wrap Holofernes’s enormous bearded head in a blood-stained cloth. At right is the general’s shiny plumed helmet, now forever empty. A follower of Caravaggio, Pietro della Vecchia adapted the famous painter’s figure types and dramatic chiaroscuro lighting. Yet this picture also reflects his interest in imitating century-old Venetian artists such as Giorgione and Palma Vecchio—represented by the women’s small figural proportions and the antiquated facial types.",
