  "text": "Sambandar was one of 63 saints who lived between the sixth and ninth centuries, and composed hymns extolling Shiva. As models for the devotee, they became holy persons in their own rite. Sambandar was the youngest saint, and he is depicted as a minimally adorned, standing infant, whose right index finger would have pointed upwards. It is said that he was left alone in a temple and began to cry from hunger. In response, the goddess Uma emerged from an image of herself on the temple ceiling and gave him a cup of milk, which is seen in the sculpture's left hand. Overcome with joy, Sambandar began to sing in praise of Shiva and Uma, all the while pointing to her image.",
