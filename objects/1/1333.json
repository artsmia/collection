  "text": "Though small, this sauceboat carries many of the hallmarks of Rococo silver: the pear-shaped body, scalloped rim, cast shell-and-hoof feet, and the stylized scrolls and foliage. Its small size is also typical of the period, when cream was dispensed by the drop. Dorothy Mills registered in 1946 upon the death of her husband Hugh Mills. She joined into partnership with Thomas Sarbit, whom she married in 1753. Shortly thereafter, she registered as Dorothy Sarbit.",
