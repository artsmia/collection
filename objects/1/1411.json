Keller also said that he acquired the painting directly from them in 1928 while still at the Galerie Georges Petit. \r\n\r\n[2] Zbrowski died suddenly of a heart attack and was left poor after losing much of his fortune in the economic crash of 1929. His widow Anna (1885–1978) subsequently sold off his art collection.  \r\n\r\n[3] Lent to MIA by Carstairs on this date, incoming loan number L50.500.",

  "text": "This painting, like Boy with a Butterfly Net, dates from Matisse’s immediate post-Fauvist period, and is a characteristic example of his painting to its most elemental. Broad blocks of color indicate land, water and sky. The thick contour lines defining the bathers seem pictorial and sculptural at the same time, and indicate Matisse’s struggle to reconcile volume and two-dimensional design through reductive means.\r\n \r\nThree Bathers relates to Matisse’s much larger Bathers with a Turtle from 1908, now in the St. Louis Art Museum. These paintings inaugurated a period of artistic experimentation that culminated in Matisse’s monumental painting known as The Dance.",
