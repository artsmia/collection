  "text": "Two boats float on a sea reflecting a dusky sky. The glow of the lowering sun illumines one, while the shadow of a cloud falls across the other. With powerful brushstrokes, rich color, and light, the artist merged water and clouds in a rhythmic whole, where sea and sky converge in a blur.\r\n\r\nThe sea was a prominent theme for Nolde, who always lived near the water. Nearly ten years before painting Evening Glow, he had been in a small boat during a storm, and the image of sea and sky from that experience stayed with him.",
