Before it can return to the galleries, conservators will need to vacuum and line it, and add a Velcro attachment to the back so it can be safely fastened to a hanging mechanism.  \r\n\r\nContact the Decorative Arts, Sculpture, and Textiles Department at DATS@artsmia.org or (612) 870-3101 to Champion this artwork.",
