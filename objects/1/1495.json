  "text": "Mount Li, a branch of the great Qinling mountain range, is located north of present-day Xi’an. Situated in an area that had been a center of politics for over 1,000 years, its cultural significance is enormous. At the height of its splendor, numerous pavilions and verandas connected its foothills to its peak, allowing rulers from various dynasties to visit its palaces and escape the intense heat of summer. Yuan Jiang, a court painter of the Yongzheng reign (1726–35), was best known as a painter of architectural settings. His professional training is readily apparent in his precise and detailed yet lyrical rendering of this rambling villa, its tiny inhabitants, and surrounding lush water foliage.",
