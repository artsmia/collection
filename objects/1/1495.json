  "text": "Yuan Jiang was born in the garden city of Yangzhou in Jiangsu province. By the 1720s a widening clientele called him to Nanjing, to Hangzhou, and by 1724 to Beijing. Yuan Jiang was summoned during the Yongzheng reign (1726-1735) to serve the court as a painter-in-waiting. \r\n\r\nAlthough he considered himself a follower of earlier artists, particularly Tang and Song landscape masters, his greatest contribution was as a painter of architectural settings. His professional training is readily apparent in his precise and detailed rendering of this rambling villa, its tiny inhabitants and the lush water foliage. The artist has skillfully conveyed a lyrical feeling to the viewer; one appropriate to the lazy mood of a midsummer day and popular with the nouveau riche merchants who were his chief patrons during his later years.",
