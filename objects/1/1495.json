  "text": "Emperor Xuanzong (r. 712–56) has escaped the heat at his summer palace in Mount Li, east of Xi’an, the capital city. These annual trips were often grand events, with officials and attendants—including the emperor’s beloved concubine, Yang Guifei—traveling alongside.\r\nIn this painting, the atmospheric mountain dominates, but if you look closely, you’ll see the emperor sitting in his palace surrounded by many female courtesans. The women are making tea, providing refreshment and entertainment; we can see their clothing, utensils, and hairstyles. And while they are scattered throughout the palace in various chambers, they all seem to have one purpose: serving the emperor.",
