  "text": "This plate, made for the German market, displays the coat of arms of the dukes of Anhalt, probably for Leopold II, who became Duke of Anhalt in 1747 and died in 1751. Due to the success of the Meissen factory of Saxony in the manufacture of porcelain, the Germans ordered little porcelain from China. German services, therefore, are very rare and were only made for the princely families, including the Hohenzollern, Schlesweig-Holstein, and the dukes of Anhalt.",
