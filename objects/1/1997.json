  "text": "Deer have long been considered sacred in Japanese culture as messengers between humans and kami, or Shinto deities. The so-called velvet that covers newly developed antlers was prized in traditional Chinese medicine as well. Because stags bellow to attract mates in the fall, Japanese poets have appreciated the call as a seasonal sign. One reading of the word deer, roku, is a homophone of “luck, ” so deer are also believed to bring good luck.",
