He is shown in this portrait with the attributes of his collecting--a classically inspired ewer and basin--and tools indicative of his scientific explorations--a globe, maps, a telescope and a compass. The books by his feet and the pamphlet in his hand bear the titles of his scholarly publications on the natural history, geology and anthropology of Crimea and southern Russia. The prince's crest, a three-dimensional rendition, is affixed to the center of the base.",
