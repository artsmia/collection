  "text": "Albert Bierstadt was a key figure of the Hudson River school, a group of painters who depicted the American landscape with a sense of discovery and awe. His work fits into the 19th-century artistic movement known as Romanticism, which emphasized emotion. Many of Bierstadt’s luminous landscape paintings were inspired by his trips to rugged places like the Rockies, the Sierra Nevada, and Yosemite Valley. The sketches he made on site became the basis for grand, majestic paintings. Landscape displays Bierstadt’s capabilities as a naturalistic, detail-oriented painter.",
