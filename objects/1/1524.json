  "text": "This sculpture was initially reconstructed following its discovery in the 16th century. Only its core is ancient. In the 18th century, Bartolomeo Cavaceppi, the foremost Italian restorer, carried out extensive repairs under the direction of the English artist and dealer in antiquities Gavin Hamilton. Such additions, or restorations, were considered necessary by collectors, who displayed their sculpture in sumptuous galleries.",
