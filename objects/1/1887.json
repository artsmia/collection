  "text": "This was the first important sculpture that Matisse completed and had cast in bronze. Dating from early in his search for an original style, it shows the artist investigating the expressive and decorative configuring of body and limbs in space. The arms blend into the torso, leaving the basic contours uninterrupted, while the bulging hip accentuates the figure’s sinuous pose.",
