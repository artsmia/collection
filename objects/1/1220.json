In addition, there are two inscriptions; the first consists of a standard Han wish to be blessed forever with dutiful sons and grandsons, the second verse reads:\u000b<P><I>The bright reflection of this mirror is a \u000b<P><I>reminder that in heaven the dragon and tiger of <P><I>the four directions protect and bring happiness <P><I>to the two parents and ensure that sons and <P><I>grandsons on earth are prosperous and <P><I>comfortable. The Heavenly Mother will protect <P><I>your lordship and keep all misfortunes away.<i>",
