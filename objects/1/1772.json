  "text": "The skill of the virtuoso painter Francesco de Mura, a leading artist in Naples, is matched by that of the unknown goldsmith responsible for this picture’s splendid silver and gilded frame. The survival of such an elaborate mount, original to the painting, is extremely rare. It is evidence of the high regard accorded this sacred object, which was likely produced for private devotion. The infant Jesus looks out at the viewer, offering a blessing, while his mother and the young Saint John the Baptist regard him with awe.",
