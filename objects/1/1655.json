  "text": "This picture belongs with a group of studies of male and female nudes painted by Caillebotte about 1880. It is unique, however, for the uncompromising realism of its anatomical observation and for its apparent sexual innuendo. The model would eventually become Caillebotte's mistress.The artist has challenged the prevalent standards of taste and morality, which accepted in paintings only the academic tradition of idealized nudes. Because of its effrontery, this picture was neither exhibited nor sold during Caillebotte's lifetime.",
