  "text": "Although Delvaux never participated formally in the Surrealist movement, he is visually involved with the \"painters of the dream\", particularly with Magritte and de Chirico. His smooth, detached style is closely akin to that of the Surrealists. Delvaux never employed the strange juxtaposition or incongruities found in Magritte's work, nor the jumbled perspective of de Chirico. But, his paintings do present a mysterious obtuse reality. Woman is the center of his dream world, silent, waiting, and always with sexual undertones.",
