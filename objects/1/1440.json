  "text": "An exceedingly rare form in Irish silver of this early date, this salt is a particularly important object in the Institute's collection.  Stylistic changes in Irish silver generally lagged well behind those of 17th century London.  This salt, however, is virtually contemporary with English examples of the same period.  George Gallant was one of the original members of the Dublin Goldsmiths' Company on their incorporation in 1637.",
