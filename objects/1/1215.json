  "text": "A pink haze encircles the blue mountain in the distance, seen through the branches of a flowering cherry blossom tree. In the middle ground, hidden among a grove of trees, is the Suijin shrine, dedicated to the deity that protected the area surrounding Sumida River. The Japanese language has a word for mist in spring, kasumi, as opposed to kiri (fog), which was traditionally associated with autumn; both were used as seasonal markers in Japanese poetry. Here, Hiroshige offered a view of Mount Tsukuba, identifiable by its two prominent peaks, Nyotai-san (“female body mountain”) and Nantai-san (“male body mountain”).",
