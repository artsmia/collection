  "text": "Hiroshige framed a view across the Sumida River towards Suijin Shrine with blossoming cherry branches. The multi-petal variety shown here blooms slightly later that the more ubiquitous single petal type. The earlier edition (left) is easily distinguishable by its delicate coloring of the background. The pale blue gradations for the sky, distant mountain, and pink haze along the horizon all masterly suggest the spring-like weather. The later edition (right), shows a darker sky and mountain silhouetted in gray suggestive of a scene at dusk.",
