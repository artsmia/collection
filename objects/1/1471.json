  "text": "Guercino excelled at monumental, lushly colored Italian Baroque paintings. An entry in the artist’s account book on January 14, 1649, records a handsome payment from an important Sicilian collector, Antonio Ruffo, for this one.\r\n\r\nThe scene is from Torquato Tasso’s popular epic poem \"Jerusalem Delivered\" (1581). The story is set during the First Crusade (1096–99), when Christian warriors laid siege to Jerusalem, then under Muslim rule. Here, the Muslim princess Erminia, disguised in armor, has fled Jerusalem. Escaping to the forest, she comes upon a shepherd and his sons making baskets. They are startled, but she removes her helmet to calm their fears, and they give her shelter.",
