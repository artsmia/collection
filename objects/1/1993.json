  "text": "The family crest prominently displayed on his right sleeve, and his notably large mouth, suggest that the actor depicted here is Ōtani Hiroemon III (1726–90). Hiroemon III debuted in Edo in the late 1740s and established his reputation playing villains. Here he is shown in the role of the bandit Asahara Jirō. His dramatic blue kumadori indicates the sinister nature of the character he is portraying.\r\nThe play, \"Masakado kamuri no hatsuyuki\" was performed at the Nakamura-za in 1777.",
