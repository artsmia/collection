  "text": "The <I>yan</I> is a type of steamer, or cooking vessel, used chiefly for grain. It consists of a <I>zeng</I>, or deep upper bowl with a pierced bottom, which was placed upon or attached to a lower, legged vessel known as a <I>li</I> (in this example the two parts are cast into an inseparable unit). Water contained within the <I>li</I> would be boiled, steaming the food in the upper bowl. <I>Yan</I> first appeared during the late Shang dynasty (c. 1300–1046 BCE), around the 12th to 11th century BCE, and was a popular form throughout the Western Zhou (c. 1046–771 BCE) and early Spring and Autumn (770–476 BCE) periods. This is a typical <I>yan</I> from the early Western Zhou period. The decoration on the upper section is fairly restrained, with only a narrow ornamental band of animal masks below the lip. The three lobes of the <I>li</I> end in cylindrical legs decorated with buffalo heads: the ridges down the center of each lobe serve as the noses of the animal masks.",
