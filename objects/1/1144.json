  "description": "The disposition of this vessel is unusual, for, despite the fact that it has the broad shallow bowl and deep foot of its class, it does not rest on the foot proper. It is supported instead by three small human figures facing outward as they grip the rim of the foot. their bent knees suggest clearly the weight of their burden, as does the strained positon of their heads, held close to the bottom of the bowl and bearing part of its weight. On each of two handles of the bent ear type, an ox reclines calmly, its head turned outward, its legs folded under the body. The division of the vessel into the usual four sections is achieved by two more animals contrasting strongly with the placid oxen. These are dragons that climb vigorously up the sides of the bowl and bite on its rim. The neck belt displays the broad, figured bands of Middle Chou and the foot carries a band of hanging scales of an advanced, almost squared type. Patina sharp green with patches of blue.",
