  "text": "This powerful, life-size female figure is a Hindu goddess known as a <I>yogini</I>. Hindu devotees worshipped yoginis as embodiments of female energy (Shakti), an energy that could be as ferocious as it was benevolent. This yogini was once enshrined in a circular, open-air temple with at least fifteen other goddesses. She has four arms, indicating her divine status. Her upper arms are holding what might be a jar of medicine and a wand for dispensing the medicine, suggesting her health-giving capabilities. Her now broken lower left arm would have held an outstretched skull cup for drinking liquor or blood. <I>Yoginis</I> were believed to possess powers of flight, to which the lightly incised bird underneath her right foot might allude.",
