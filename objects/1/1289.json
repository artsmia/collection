  "text": "This rare survival of Chinese export enamelled copper formed part of a large dinner service commissioned by the Saldanha de Albuquerque family of Portugal. This service is one of the most unusual Chinese export services to have been produced during the eighteenth century. Typical services were decorated with family coats of arms, designs copied from European prints, Chinese-style figures or floral motifs. The Saldanha service, however, is decorated with appropriate food stuffs: a large ham replaces the usual coat of arms, surrounded by fruits, fowl and vegetables.",
