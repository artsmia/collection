  "text": "This sun-dappled  view of the forest at Fontainbleau is animated by the tiny figure carrying a bundle of wood. Narcisse-Virgile Diaz de la Peña was a central figure among the colony of painters at Barbizon and first worked in Fontainebleau in the late 1830s. Thereafter, he was a prolific painter of the forest's dense glades and expansive moors; his work was a particularly important influence on the landscapes of the young Auguste Renoir.",
