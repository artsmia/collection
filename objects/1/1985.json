  "text": "Late Zhou potters borrowed freely from ritual bronze vessel shapes. This is understandable because through most of the Shang (1523-1028 BCE) and Zhou (1027-256 BCE) dynasties, ceremonial bronzes constituted the highest art form. The <I>taotie</I> mask handles, molded animal designs and shape of this earthenware <I>hu</I> relate closely to a bronze <I>hu</I> in the Pillsbury collection.",
