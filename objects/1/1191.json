He gives audience to four men, one of whom kneels before him. At his left a man is seated near the king on a camp stool, while another, standing, peers in upon the scene from the edge of the picture. The scene is painted against a bluish white hillside, schemetically flecked with grass and outlined in violet against a golden sky. Warm tints of green, yellow and red, with greys and touches of gold unite with clear red and a bright blue to form the color scheme.",
