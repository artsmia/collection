  "text": "In New Ireland, elaborate ceremonies called <i>malagan</i> commemorate the deaths of important members of society. Music, dance, the exchange of gifts, and the display of specially commissioned sculptures honor the deceased and enhance the prestige of surviving relatives. The sculpted images usually incorporate animals that are the clan symbols of the deceased.\r\n\r\nThe female figure on this pole stands on the head of a pig, an animal that plays a prominent role in ceremonial offerings. The circular design in the center, known as <i>mataling</i>, or “eye of fire, ” refers to the sun. It is flanked by two frigate birds, one above and one below, important symbols of strength in New Ireland culture.",
