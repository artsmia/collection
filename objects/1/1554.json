  "text": "O'Keeffe was particularly fond of Pedernal Peak, a prominent mesa near her home at Ghost Ranch, New Mexico. It is my private mountain, she once said, God told me if I painted it enough, I could have it. In an unusual juxtaposition, she has framed the mountain within the opening of an abstracted bone, a common motif in her later work.",
