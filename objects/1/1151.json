  "text": "This flask is a variation on a <I>hu</I> wine vessel. The low-relief surface decor is confined to its belly. In the lower belt, on a ground of squared spirals, it consists of a geometric pattern of the compound-lozenge and interlocked-T motifs. It also recalls the decor of the white ceramic wares of Anyang. The band above presents highly stylized dragons in profile. The top belt displays a band of S-shaped spirals bordered by circle bands. On the neck, just below the two raised bow strings, are a pair of small ears, for attaching a cord.",
