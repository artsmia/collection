  "text": "Canaletto’s hometown of Venice was his lifelong muse.  Fastidiously recording every window, door, and chimney along the thoroughfare, Canaletto captured the special qualities of this miraculous city on water—the stately architecture, the shimmering light, and, in the scattered figures and gondolas, the routine of daily life. The near photographic precision of his paintings made them especially popular with tourists, who bought them as mementos of their travels to Italy. Today, you can see this vista (approximately) from the train station.\r\n\r\nThere are at least three other versions of this particular view of the Grand Canal (Getty Museum, Los Angeles, Wallace Collection, London, and art market, London, 1998) as well as an engraving by Antonio Visentini from 1742. The scholar Charles Beddington recently suggested that the Minneapolis painting might be a copy by Bernardo Bellotto, a close follower of Canaletto and successful painter in his own right.",
