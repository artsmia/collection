  "text": "Known as yazhang, this type of jade originated during the Longshan culture (c. 2500â€“c. 2000 BCE) in northeast China and was used as a ceremonial scepter until the Western Zhou dynasty. Yazhang scepters vary in their form and scale according to culture and geography. This yazhang has a long, narrow blade that curves slightly and ends in a nearly symmetrical, lunar-shaped cutting edge. On the other end, between the rectangular handle and blade, pairs of ornate teeth project beyond the edges of the scepter and are connected by incised horizontal bands. A central perforation has been drilled from one side at the stem of the handle. In its scale, shape, and toothed projections, this scepter resembles those from the late period of the Erlitou culture, which flourished in the central plains of China.",
