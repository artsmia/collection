  "text": "These decorative terra-cotta tiles for the Farmers and Merchants Bank in Hector, Minnesota were designed by George Grant Elmslie in his own style of organic ornamentation, developed during twenty years as Louis Sullivan's chief draftsman. Stylized plant forms combined with geometric patterns, repeated throughout the facade, separate the brick lower level from the light stucco second story. This section was removed in 1970 when the bank was remodeled.",
