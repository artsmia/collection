  "text": "This young woman clearly comes from a prosperous family. The family crests in the painting have not yet been identified, unfortunately, and her identity remains a mystery. Georg Pencz was the official city painter of Nuremberg, Germany, when he made this portrait. He had been banished from the city 22 years earlier because he supported radical Protestantism, in defiance of the City Council that was thoroughly Catholic at the time. Just a few weeks later, however, the city switched to the Protestant side and Pencz was welcomed back into its good graces.",
