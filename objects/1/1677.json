  "text": "<p>The historic frame is a gift of the Douglas and Mary Olson Frame Acquisition Fund.\n </p><p>This young woman, age 20, is portrayed wearing a black beret, red dress with fur trimmed cuffs and velvet trim, white blouse, and short black vest. Another portrait by Georg Pencz (now in the Alte Pinakothek, Munich) of identical size depicts a man in a matching outfit—a black beret, red coat, white shirt, and black cloak—and sitting in a similarly appointed interior—with a glass vessel on a stone ledge and a prominent coat of arms. Scholar Katrin Dyballa (2014) believes the portraits are connected and represent a married couple. She has suggested possibly identifying the sitters as Thomas Schweitzer and Christina Hoffman, who married in Nuremberg, Germany, in 1538. Unfortunately, the family crest in the Minneapolis painting cannot be identified to confirm the sitter is Christina Hoffman (d. 1550).\n</p><p>Georg Pencz was the official city painter of Nuremberg when he made this portrait. He had been briefly banished from the city in 1525 for supported radical Protestantism, in defiance of the City Council that was thoroughly Catholic at the time. Just a few weeks later, however, the city switched to the Protestant side and Pencz was welcomed back into its good graces.\n</p>",
