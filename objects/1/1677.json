  "text": "<p></p><p>\n\tThe historic frame is a gift of the Douglas and Mary Olson Frame Acquisition Fund. \n</p>\n<p>\n\tThis young woman, age 20, is portrayed wearing a black beret, red dress with velvet trim and fur trimmed cuffs, white blouse, and short black vest. Another portrait by Georg Pencz (now in the Alte Pinakothek, Munich), of the same size, depicts a man in a matching outfit—a black beret, red coat, white shirt, and black cloak. He is sitting in an identical interior, with a shallow stone ledge bearing a water-filled glass vessel, that is framed, like bookends, with a prominent coat of arms. The portraits must be connected and likely represent a married couple. Scholar Katrin Dyballa (2014) suggested identifying the sitters as Thomas Schweitzer and Christina Hoffman, who married in Nuremberg, Germany, in 1538. Unfortunately, the family crests elude identification to help confirm this.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tGeorg Pencz was the official city painter of Nuremberg when he made this portrait. He had been briefly banished from the city in 1525 for supported radical Protestantism, in defiance of the City Council that was thoroughly Catholic at the time. Just a few weeks later, however, the city switched to the Protestant side and Pencz was welcomed back into its good graces.\n</p>",
