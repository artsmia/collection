  "text": "At the turn of the 20th century, Sweden was swept by a wave of nationalism. This movement, which was partially a reaction to the rapid development of industrialism, was led and supported by writers, musicians, and artists who were keen to preserve the country's cultural heritage. \r\n\r\nIn 1896, Anders Zorn moved to Mora, a picturesque village in central Sweden. Zorn sought to uphold the traditional culture of the region through his paintings of daily life and folk customs, which often featured local females at their work in the field or in the home. The Girl from Älvdalen, with its accurate rendering of the traditional costume of the neighboring Älvdalen parish, is entirely typical of Zorn's interest in folk culture.",
