  "text": "Professor Andreas Christian Hviid (1749–1788) was a Danish philologist and theologian, and provost of the prestigious college of Regensen at the University of Copenhagen. In the spring of 1785, Hviid planted a linden tree in a courtyard near the old residence hall of the college, which earned him the title \"Pater tiliae,\" or \"Father Linden.\" Since the 18th century, students have staged numerous events and gatherings under this linden tree. When the tree died in 1953, a new linden tree was planted at the same spot. \r\n\r\nThis portrait remained in the family of Professor Hviid until well into the 20th century. We are grateful to Bent Sorensen for clarifying the provenance of the pastel, and illuminating details in Professor Hviid's career.",
