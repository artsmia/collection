  "text": "This massive <I>amphora</I>, used for carrying wine or oil, recalls the works of the great Exekias. The figures, although lacking the refinement found in those he painted, exhibit this master's distinctive style, which others in his workshop copied.\r\n<P>The front shows a quadriga, or four-horse chariot, at rest. Standing inside are Poseidon, holding a trident, and his wife, Amphitrite. An unidentified goddess, perhaps Athena, and Hermes, who holds a caduceus, or symbolic staff, stand beside the chariot. The scene may depict the gods and goddesses preparing to depart for an Olympian council or for the wedding of Peleus and Thetis.",
