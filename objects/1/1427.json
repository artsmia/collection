  "text": "Marc Chagall was born in the small town of Vitebsk [Viciebsk, Belarus] in the Russian Empire, the eldest son of a poor Jewish family. After training in Saint Petersburg, he moved to Paris in 1910, where he painted \"The Poet with the Birds.\" A man in traditional Russian clothing seems to float as he lazily daydreams, staring up at the white birds in the tree. With the new freedom Chagall found in France, his work became increasingly dreamlike, anticipating Surrealist art of the 1920s and 1930s. A movement in both literature and visual art, Surrealism aimed to tap into the subconscious mind, often through dreamlike imagery.",
