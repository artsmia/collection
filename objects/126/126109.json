  "text": "Bottles and Jars 18c presents two dozen glass bottles and jars filled with colorful liquids arranged on a reflective tabletop before a bright window. A gifted colorist, Schwartz creates a luminous color harmony in the print, of blues, reds, greens, oranges and golds, which vibrantly glisten against the white paper, and reflect against one another through the translucent glass and upon the mirrored ledge. \r\n\r\nSchwartz’s work in recent years focuses on still life subjects and interior spaces and sits on the border between reality and abstraction. An obsessive, rigorous designer of structure and space, Schwartz composes with the infinite variety of shapes, colors and geometry provided by a room and its contents, or even a table laden with objects.",
