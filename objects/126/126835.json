  "text": "World War II transformed the lives of Sylvia Fein and her friends. The Tea Party shows the artist in the role of Alice at a table set for absent friends in a landscape that nearly echoes to reinforce the void they have left in her life. Wisconsin’s Driftless Area is Fein’s Wonderland and she reclines against a rock formation that swells and writhes with the suggestion of concealed images–birds, lizards, faces, hands–as though the very Earthwas mutable, unstable, and ready to change itself and challenge her understanding of reality. A card on the table is inscribed “WKS/Hawaii,” revealing the picture’s dedication to her husband, off in the Pacific. Fein’s self-portrait as Alice suggests magical thinking and the will to have control over the whims of fate.\r\n",
