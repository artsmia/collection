  "text": "A Swedish émigré who spent 40 years in Los Angeles—after first settling in Minnesota—Anders Aldrin knew this landscape well. It is Griffith Park, five square miles of mountainous terrain on the city’s eastern edge. Unlike typical printmakers, whose goal is to have each successive impression resemble the sheet before and after it, he gave nearly every impression a new color scheme, treating each like an individual artwork. In California Hills, Aldrin wanted to capture the park’s mood during different seasons and times of day.",
