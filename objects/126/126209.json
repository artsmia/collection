  "text": "From a series of woodblock monoprints known as \"Atomic Mystic Portraits,\" this dazzling geometric abstraction relies on the dynamic interplay of shape, pattern, and brilliant color for its spatial and visual power. Variation and repetition within a structured formal arrangement is key to understanding Apfelbaum’s experimental approach. Working intuitively, she builds complexity from a deliberate, additive process, positioning multiple small woodblocks within a larger rectangular matrix to create a harmonious, visually delightful composition. Each of the woodblocks is inked separately, and then printed simultaneously to form a single composite image.",
