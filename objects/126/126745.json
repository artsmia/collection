  "text": "As soon as possible after the earthquake and tsunami hit the northeastern Japan on March 11, 2011, Hatakeyama returned home to the small town called Rikuzentakata in Iwate Prefecture. Within a week, he began documenting the transformed landscape and built environment of his hometown. While photographing, he struggled to maintain as neutral a distance as possible from the once-familiar neighborhoods, now mute. Since the initial devastation, a large network of conveyor belts has been built to transport construction and fill materials from one location to another—resembling the scenes of limestone quarries and processing plants photographed earlier. Hatakeyama characterizes the photographs as “biographical landscape,” tracing the process of the land’s transformation “with a desire to report the entirety of the events to someone beyond ourselves.” Up to the present date, he has made more than 8,000 images of the town.",
