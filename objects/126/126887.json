  "text": "This portrait of a boy, although small in scale, is immediately engaging due to the boy’s direct and confident gaze at the viewer, his eye-catching attire, and the liveliness of the composition. It is an allegory for the importance of discipline and restraint in the upbringing of children. The calm assurance communicated by the boy’s face and posture convince the viewer that he will triumph over the unruly nature of his canine companion and will be the model of controlled restraint, just like his pet bullfinch.",
