  "text": "Among the vibrant patches in this crazy quilt are three printed souvenir ribbons: two relate to Freemasons (men-only secret societies that act as social groups), and the third commemorates the 1882 Wisconsin Pharmaceutical Association meeting. Souvenir ribbons in similar crazy quilts typically reference women’s charitable organizations or Civil War veterans’ reunions. The emphasis on exclusively male social and professional societies seen here is rare in the distinctly feminine, domestic craft of quilting.\r\n\r\nThe donors of this quilt trace its ownership through their grandfather, Frank H. Allen. Originally from Wisconsin, Allen later lived in Staples, Minnesota, and was a doctor. Allen would have been a child when the quilt was made, and it is possible his father also worked in the medical field.  \r\n\r\n\r\nConservation of this artwork was made possible by Barbara and Paul Mikelson, in memory of Emma Kloos Hitzemann, through Mia's Art Champions program.",
