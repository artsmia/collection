  "art_champions_text": "Conservation Cost $4,045\r\n\r\nThis fantastic crazy quilt is unique in its inclusion of commemorative ribbons, some of which have to do with medical and pharmaceutical professional organizations—unusual components of women’s hand-made creations. It was common in the late 1800s to treat silk fabrics with metallic salts, chemicals that added weight and sheen to the fabric and produced a pleasing rustling sound when worn as a dress. The downside of these chemicals, however, is that over the long term they are abrasive to the silk fibers they were meant to “improve,” often resulting in breakage or “shattering.” Conservation is needed to repair and support many of the shattered silk patches throughout this remarkable handmade creation. Treatments will take the form of adhesive underpatches and fine netting overlays. Once conservation is complete, this new acquisition will be able to go on public display for the first time ever. \r\n\r\nContact the Decorative Arts, Sculpture, and Textiles Department at DATS@artsmia.org or (612) 870-3101 to Champion this artwork.",
