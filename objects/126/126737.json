  "text": "Harriet Bart’s artistic practice focuses on the personal and cultural expression of memory, loss, and time, using material objects to signify places, events, and historical connections to the present. Patterns is the eleventh artist’s book Bart has produced since 2000. Published as part of a body of work (2016) exploring the concept of fragments, the book features a series of abstract black silhouettes traced from paper sewing patterns. Featuring a combination of single-page (folio) and gatefold construction, the book focuses on the concept of the part in relation to the absence of a larger unseen whole, in this instance, a garment. Designed as both an elegy and a workbook exercise, Patterns combines Bart’s austere imagery with the melancholic prose poem “Garments” (1894-97) by the Greek poet Constantine P. Cavafy. Bart arranges her sewing pattern images as a pictorial complement to Cavafy’s poem, with individual fragments evoking process, labor, and the feminine gesture. The book is a commemorative tribute to the forgotten histories and frequently unheralded contributions of women’s labor within a patriarchal society.",
