  "text": "This assemblage of objects is the sacred emblem of an all-male association called the Leopard Spirit Society. The association served as a traditional form of law enforcement in the past and continues to be an important social institution today. The emblem was attached to the center pillar of a society’s lodge, the structure in which members would hold their meetings. Its basic configuration is a woven palm-leaf mat, adorned in the middle with a drum. It carries a ceremonial spoon and a ritual broom of the type used to sweep away forces intending to harm members. Most striking are the numerous skulls and bones attached to the mat, remains of animals consumed at ceremonial meals.",
