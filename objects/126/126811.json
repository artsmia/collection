  "text": "Danish designer, Verner Panton (1926-1998), is known for his commitment to utopian design ideals and total interior schemes. He often used fabric suites to cover walls, ceilings, floors, and furniture, in order to blur boundaries throughout the built environment. In 1960, Panton designed the Astoria restaurant in Trondheim, Norway, and won international acclaim. He soon partnered with Herman Miller, and later became artistic director to the Swiss textile firm, Mira-X.\r\n\r\nIn 1971, Panton designed the Mira-X Decor I collection: a selection of monochromatic printed velvet textiles in eight colorways – orange, bright red, deep red, eggplant, mauve, purple, blue, and turquoise – with repeating geometric shapes – circles, squares, and stripes. It was his most popular textile line.",
