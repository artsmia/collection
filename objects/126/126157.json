  "text": "Of Summer is the second of four prints constituting Hodges’ \"Seasons\" suite. His dreamlike vision of a tree-filled landscape and fair-weather skies reflected on the surface of open water evokes the fleeting days of the summer season. Hodges blends form, color, and texture in a complex, layered composition that mirrors the inherent beauty and intricacies of the natural world. Demonstrating a technical mastery of materials and methods, he creates a harmonious whole, the visual equivalent of a poem.",
