  "text": "This sculpture depicts the male Buddhist deity Hevajra in sexual embrace with the female deity Nairatmaya. While wrathful in appearance, he symbolizes compassion, and she wisdom: their union transcends opposites and dissolves into the great bliss of enlightenment. As practitioners of Vajrayana Buddhism meditated on this image, the soul was awakened to a higher level of consciousness, far from the everyday activities of mundane human existence.\r\n\r\nIn this vigorous and crisp visualization, one sees the Buddhist deities astride the bodies of Brahmanical (Hindu) deities, a reference to the lively spiritual debates held at monastic centers of Northeast India.",
