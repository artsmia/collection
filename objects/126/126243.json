  "text": "Look closely: A bird’s beak is subtly emerging from the man’s face. Rick Bartow was interested in depicting transformations, and he was especially curious about how humans are altered in death. Many of his works explore the nature of transforming from the physical to a spiritual realm. Bartow admired expressionist painters who used visible, vigorous brushstrokes, such as Cy Twombly and Francis Bacon, and his unique style is evident in this drawing—a characteristic attempt to balance reverence and humor.",
