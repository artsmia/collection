  "text": "These women address one another from opposite sides of a partisan divide. The woman on the right is dressed for revolution with a utilitarian hat, prominent cockade, and natural, unpowdered hair. Her tricolor riding habit closely parallels men’s contemporary military dress. The magazine even refers to her ensemble as a “uniform, ” acknowledging women’s active involvement in the revolutionary movement. She points accusingly to a woman who clings to the past with her powdered coiffure and formal silk gown. But both exploit color symbolism: from head to toe the revolutionary commits to the national colors, while the other chooses yellow and purple: both counterrevolutionary symbols. Purple traditionally represented royalty, while yellow and black were the national colors of Austria, Queen Marie Antoinette’s homeland. The traditionalist’s feathered headdress— reminiscent of a crown—leaves no doubt about her political orientation.",
