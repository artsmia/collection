  "text": "Le Rire was a weekly satirical magazine published in Paris from 1894 to the 1950s. Many artists contributed cartoons. These same artists often worked in other modes, such as poster design, fine art prints, or fashion illustration as seen in their other works in Mia’s collection. Many of the illustrations display the graceful lines and flat (Japonesque) coloration of Art Nouveau, but other, often much edgier, styles appear, too. The works touch on many themes: politics, social mores, class, sex, war, entertainment, work, national identity, and much more. One might think of Le Rire as an equivalent to today’s late-night TV talk shows.",
