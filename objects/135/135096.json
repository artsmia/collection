  "text": "Mission Mini-Comix is a loosely organized, San Francisco-based collective consisting of the two comic artists Mikey Reger and Rio Roth-Barreiro and their friends. They make eight-page minicomics using a single 8-1/2 x 11 inch sheet of paper, which detail political and social commentary with a sarcastic sense of humor. Members contribute their own illustrations and writing to these collaborative efforts, resulting in a comic finished in multiple styles but which coheres in its content and critical leanings. Mission Mini-Comix are xeroxed in editions ranging from several hundred to a couple thousand and are distributed at protests and bookfairs in San Francisco and across the country.",
