  "text": "In the 1950s, Hagiwara came in touch with stories of the Greek gods filled with virtues and sins, good and evil. Although the characters carry the names of gods, they are like the mirror of our world because they are not ashamed of exposing true human nature. He tried to reproduce a human daydream with his series of 42 figurative subjects, rendered solely in black and white. Each print is devoted to a famous character like Glaukos, originally a fisherman, who, after eating a magical herb, became a sea god in the shape of a merman with the gift of prophecy.",
