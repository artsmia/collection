  "text": "Grandchild: 孫\r\nMaki was fascinated by the similarity between Chinese writing and pictures. Here, a bold, sticklike figure with a circle for a head and arms raised stands in the center of this print. The figure, along with the smaller one just underneath (two circles, arms down), is the character for grandchild, or mago. Maki surrounded the character in an invented cursive script. He printed the background in a greenish gray; the thin squiggly lines scattered throughout refer to old worm-eaten paper, further highlighting the merging of old and new.",
