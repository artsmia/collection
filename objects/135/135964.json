  "text": "An extremely high level of precision is characteristic for Amano’s prints starting in 1963. The geometric patterns seem to reference the nuts, bolts, and other machine parts that the artist grew up with; his family ran a machine shop and he studied furniture design in college. Solely working with wood printing techniques, he used birch-faced plywood and usually a combination of oil-base, lithographic, and screen-print ink.",
