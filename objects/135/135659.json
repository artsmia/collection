  "text": "A Yamato farm house refers to traditional residential architecture typical in the Yamato region of Japan (modern-day Nara, Osaka, and Kyoto prefectures). It is characterized by a steeply-angled straw-thatched roof, lined on either side with tile roofing, and a lower-gradient roof attached to the side. These buildings were a status symbol, as only wealthy farmers could afford to live in them. Tanaka grew up in Takatsuki, Osaka prefecture, where this style of residence was common.",
