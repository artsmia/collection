Here, Villares depicts the intricate branching systems of various river systems, plant roots, lightning bolts, and human blood vessels, compiling observational data that demonstrates their morphological similarities. For Villares, these structural correspondences lends evidence to the presence of a universal spiritual force that controls the natural world.",
