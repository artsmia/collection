  "text": "Cuban artist Antonio Fernandez Reboiro designed this poster while working at the Instituto Cubano de Arte e Industria Cinematográfico (ICAIC), Cuba’s government-run film institute. Featuring brilliant color, bold typography, and imagery inspired by American Pop art, the poster promotes the 1968 film LBJ, a satirical anti-war, anti-American documentary directed by Cuban filmmaker Santiago Alvarez (1919–1998).  The film and poster were part of Cuba’s longstanding efforts to undermine and demonize the American government during the period’s “Cold War” between the Soviet Union with its satellite states, and the United States with its allies after World War II.",
