  "text": "Fred Martin is a prominent Bay Area artist, author, and educator, whose work is noted for its expressive style and idiosyncratic content. Night Flight of Eagles is an early example of the Martin’s collage practice, here featuring a mysterious nocturnal timeline that chronicles a series of dream-like events that take place between sunset and dawn. Rich in symbolism and autobiographical details, the time-based collage can be read as a visual poem of sorts that reveals glimpses of the artist’s memories and emotions through text and imagery. In the end, the collage may be interpreted as a highly personal conceptual experiment that remains ambiguous in meaning and intent.",
