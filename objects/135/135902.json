  "text": "Earlier in his printing career, before focusing on calligraphic characters, Maki tried out different subjects, including excavated objects such as this jar-like shape. His interest in textured surfaces is evident: concentric swirled lines evoke woodgrain, a common effect in woodblock printing, and the netted pattern at the bottom left is reminiscent of cracked pottery sherds, signaling to the viewer that this abstract shape might be some sort of earthenware. Furthermore, Maki used overprinting to layer patterns and mix colors on the paper, thereby creating depth. This print consists of at least three impressions—one gray, one brown, and the last black, printed one on top of the other.",
