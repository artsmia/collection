  "text": "Throughout the 1960s, Maki oscillated between calligraphic and abstract works. These four prints show how Maki played with geometric forms, color, dimensionality, and texture. All feature embossing with cement, which created the bumpy, sometimes pockmarked texture on the paper, but to varying degrees: Maki used the technique to cover the entire ground in 65 – 6, while he only used it to emboss a small square area in May – 2. Bright, solid colors add visual rhythm, momentarily drawing the eye away from the rough textures. In addition to embossing, some colored areas are debossed—depressed\r\ninstead of raised—thereby creating different levels of dimension on a single, flat piece of paper.",
