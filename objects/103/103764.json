  "text": "American artist Jessica Stockholder is a leading contemporary sculptor, painter, printmaker, book artist, and pioneering figure in site-specific multi-media installations. Brilliant, high-key color, texture and surface, and the spatial relationship of objects are crucial to Stockholder's work. Her fascination with vivid color, assemblage, and spatial relationships is also found in her original prints and artist's books, as in this example from 2007, where she blends appropriated representational imagery with abstract geometric designs, symbols, letters, and signs.",
