In the center of the back, in an appliqu√©d panel framed in sprays of embroidered gold leaves, is a kneeling figure of the Madonna embroidered in colored silks. She holds a bursting pomegranate in her hands and the front of her robe is embroidered with a small medallion bearing a figure of Christ. Above the Madonna's head is a medallion with the letters IHS (from the Greek IHCOYC: Jesus) with a cross above. Around her figure is a banderole bearing the inscription: Marya Gettudis Delcorazonde. The sides and bottom of the cope are bordered with an embroidered band of floral and leafy sprays, and the neck is finished with an embroidered band of similar design said to be of Louis XCI workmanship and a later addition. Lining of blue taffeta.",
