  "text": "This fabirc is from Mark Pollack's 2007 collection that has drawn its inspiration from the historic textile holdings at the Rhode Island School of Design, his alma mater. The  panel, made for use in 21st century homes, is a consummate statement about the designer's ability to move beyond structure to communicate the aesthetic statement.\r\n\r\nThis fabirc is a complex structure woven in Switzerland on computer programmed and power-driven jacquard looms, the most sophisticated equipment available, and yet was inspired by textiles hand-embroidered in the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nCascade references the weeping willow trees depicted on American schoolgirl mourning embroideries.",
