  "text": "Though best known for her abstract painted wood sculptures, Louise Nevelson was intrigued by the expressive possibilities of printmaking.  In 1947, Nevelson studied etching with Stanley Hayter at Atelier 17 in New York City. She later returned there to work with Leo Katz and Peter Grippe, who both served as directors of the New York studio. Nevelson's untitled print shares many of the conceptual and compositional features of her abstract sculpture, most prominently her fascination with subtle variations in value, tone, and texture achieved by the juxtaposition of contrasting monochromatic forms. Using various types of etching and the tonal intaglio process of aquatint, she achieves a highly refined and mysteriously compelling composition.",
