  "text": "An acclaimed printmaker, painter, and book artist, Michele Burgess is co-director (with Bill Kelly) of San Diego's Brighton Press, an internationally recognized publisher of artist's books. Burgess works primarily in a non-representational style, using only color, form, light, and shade to evoke the emotional and intellectual content of her work. Luminous color, drawn from nature, is the overriding concern of her prints. Much of her print work incorporates one or more intaglio techniques, including drypoint, aquatint, and etching. As a result, her intaglio prints, when printed on handmade papers, exhibit a richly textured surface. \r\n\r\nIn The Blue Vein Burgess collaborated with Montana-based poet Sandra Alcosser. Alcosser's poem, The Blue Vein, concerns the redemptive power of art. Its subject is the courage and conviction of Vedran Smailovic, a cellist from the Sarajevo Philharmonic Orchestra who, in a memorial to twenty-two of his neighbors killed by a bomb blast as they stood in a breadline, played his cello in the bomb's crater for the next twenty-two days. As an expression of beauty and light in the face of brutality and darkness, Smailovic, wearing tuxedo and tails, played an adagio by Bach that had been recovered in pieces from the Dresden bombing of World War II.",
