  "text": "This electric espresso pot for home use was a technological advancement over stovetop models, able to be used anywhere an electric outlet could be found. It followed from the success of electric hot water kettles first introduced in the 1910s in Germany. \r\nSet up like a standard stovetop espresso pot, with water in the bottom, grounds in the center, and percolated coffee filling the top receptacle, this 1930’s version with its geometric elements, draws from the furniture and design developed in Germany at the Bauhaus. Its playfulness made a statement at coffee break. This is the largest of the three sizes, an eight-cup version, ideal for guests. It also came in two other sizes: a six-cup and a four-cup version.",
