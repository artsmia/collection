  "text": "This small ivory brushrest is carved in the shape of a <I>tai-hu</I> garden rock. Growing between the pierced stones are flowers and a gnarled prunus tree. The <I>tai hu</I> rock and prunus are standard symbols for scholarly tenacity and their use as motifs in a brush rest is, therefore, perfectly logical.",
