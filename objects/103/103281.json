  "text": "Sometimes Charles Milcendeau sought subjects beyond the French countryside. Old Spanish Woman dates from the transformative year he spent in Spain, where he felt a great affinity for the culture. In the hillside town of Ledesma, he made several drawings of elderly women.\r\n\r\nThe figure in this forceful study is an image of enduring strength. She is proud, not pitiable. Focusing on her face, Milcendeau captured the tired, rough-hewn features that testify to a hard life.",
