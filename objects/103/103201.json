  "text": "Philippe-Auguste Jeanron was intensely interested in depicting the various social types in the French population. The Meeting shows two men from Jeanron's native region of Limousin, in central France, wearing their traditional costume of baggy pants, wide-brimmed hat, and leather boots drawn up to the knee. It prefigures the midcentury realist approach of seizing on images of ordinary life as a way to create art accessible to all.",
