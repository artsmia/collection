  "text": "In 1905, Charles Milcendeau bought a farmstead in the heart of the Vendée marshes near his hometown of Soullans in western France. In this drawing, we see at left his modest house with its distinctive doorway, painted to look like a pointed stone arch. Before the house is a small pumphouse and basin. Part of the barn at right contained his studio. Trees of various maturities line the garden and fields. With some trees having brown leaves and others barren, plus patches of white that seem like the last vestiges of snow, it feels like the workers are engaged in an early spring cleanup.\r\n\r\nTo make this very personal drawing, Milcendeau combined various media, including ink, watercolor, gouache, crayon, and charcoal, all worked with consummate skill. Today the buildings serve as a small museum dedicated to his life and art.",
