  "text": "Louise Bourgeois ranks among the most influential and innovative artists of the twentieth century. Renowned for her sculpture, she has also been active as a printmaker for much of her career, producing over 100 prints since 1973. This whimsical depiction of a couple lying close together in a large feather bed typifies her best work as a printmaker, in which she mines themes and motifs from her own childhood experiences and memories. Here, the bodies of the embracing figures press down on the soft feather bed, forming a large pair of lips at the side of the bed, perhaps serving as a metaphor for contentment and physical intimacy.",
