  "text": "Not everything that looks like a veil is a veil. This cloth, intricately dyed in a wave (lahariya) pattern, actually is a gentleman's cummerbund (patka).  Wrapped around the waist so that the flowered end panels hang down in front, this type of sash became popular with north Indian courtiers in the mid-1600s and remained fashionable for the next 250 years. The sash's pastel hues and lahariya design were appropriate for Holi, a Hindu festival marking the end of the cold season and onset of spring.",
