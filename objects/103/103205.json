  "text": "Victor Émile Prouvé was an accomplished painter and decorative arts designer—of glass, embroidery, furniture, ceramics, and bookbinding. He achieved success as a large-scale mural painter, executing important cycles in Paris and his hometown Nancy. He was also a gifted portraitist. In this study, the artist depicts an elderly worker, seated with hat in hand. With concentrated, fluid strokes, he captures in the figure’s face and stooped posture, the man’s weariness and exhaustion.",
