  "text": "This drawing is a study for an enormous mural, 25 by 68 feet, created for the Musée des Beaux-Arts in Nantes. For this important commission, Hippolyte Dominique Berteaux produced a pair of paintings: Brittany at Work: The Threshing of Grain (still on view in the museum) and Mystical Brittany (severely damaged and now awaiting restoration). This drawing provides a glimpse of the composition and includes carefully inscribed notes on colors and details for the final project. The theme is the “pardons of Brittany”—yearly celebrations of a church's patron saint, at which an indulgence (pardon) is granted. A colorful aspect of the pardons was the procession of pilgrims all in Breton dress. Through his images, Berteaux conveyed the majesty and humanity of an event that held deep significance for the people of the region.",
