  "text": "Geometric forms and the power of their aesthetic, particularly in a repeating pattern, fascinate Mark Pollack. His understanding of the potential of contemporary technology in terms of visual possibilities, particularly in the area of woven structures, gives him an exceptionally large set of tools with which to work. However, the distinctive contribution he has made is not limited to the woven form, as these two textiles testify. The addition of printed pattern or embroidered embellishment has highlighted the lush, refined quality that is traditionally associated rich velvet.",
