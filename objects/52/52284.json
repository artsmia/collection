  "text": "While bamboo was used throughout Chinese history to produce an astonishing variety of functional objects, the perishable nature of the material means only a small percentage of those works has survived. This rare folding hat stand, however, is well-preserved and it demonstrates the versatility of the material. The elegantly curved legs are hinged top and bottom on three horizontal struts, the bottom ones support circular motifs representing bronze coins. The legs are decoratively carved with blond, split cane. Lightweight and collapsible, the stand could travel easily or be readily stored.",
