  "text": "Dwight Case Sturges earned his living as a newspaper artist. Working at the Boston Globe and the Christian Science Monitor, he illustrated thousands of stories with his sketches. In 1908, he began etching in his spare time, using a press he installed in his attic. His first exhibition came in 1914, the year of this print. Like his other figure studies, it shows a journalist's eye for economy and detail. Natalie Sturges Butler wrote that her father loved the sea, and he traveled often to the Maine coast and Boston wharves with his sketch pad.",
