  "text": "This pouch was made to hold special personal objects, a purpose reflected in its construction.  The tin cones attached to the ends of the fringe would make a pleasing sound when the wearer moved.  The choice of bead colors and motifs makes this object a tour de force of the A'aninin style, which is known for the feathered motif, unusual bead colors, and the spotstitch technique of applying beads.",
