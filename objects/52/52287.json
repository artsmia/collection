  "text": "This large ink stick is decorated on one side with Mount Penglai, the mythical immortal isle in the Eastern Sea. Rising like a mysterious pedestal rock from the stylized waves, the mountain is similar to depictions of Penglai found in Daoist paintings. The reverse is inscribed with the three-character title Penglai shan (Mount Penglai 蓬莱山), and a long, raised paragraph describing the paradise. The inscription is followed by the signature, “made in the Garden of Bamboo Fields and Pure Pines,” and two seals, “Harmony Spring.”",
