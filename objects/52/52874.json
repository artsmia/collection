  "text": "The lavish decorative program at France's Fontainebleau palace was driven by Italians, in particular Rosso Fiorentino and Primaticcio. Today Primaticcio's eloquent inventions are known largely through scarce prints such as this. Here a monumental Rebecca offers a drink amid a rhythmic array of water jugs, alluding to France's riches and the generosity of its kings. Primaticcio knew these classical forms well: he went to Rome to make casts of ancient statues for his royal patrons back in France.",
