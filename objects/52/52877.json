  "text": "The myth of the unicorn likely grew out of ancient sightings of the Indian rhinoceros, the only true one-horned animal. Unicorns were popular in French art, appearing in tapestries and paintings in the Middle Ages and Renaissance. Jean Duvet created a series of unicorn prints apparently inspired by the lifelong love between King Henri II and his mistress, Diane de Poitiers. These two chaotic prints illustrate the ferocious side of the creature as he resists capture, and his saintly demeanor in the presence of a virgin, who alone has the power to tame him.",
