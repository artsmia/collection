  "text": "In his training as a young architect, Piranesi learned techniques of Baroque stage design, which he used to impart grandeur to his drawings. He was especially fond of oblique projections—slanting forms that create a strong sensation of space—and their manipulation through subtle shifts of perspective. He often included tiny human figures to provide a sense of scale.",
