  "text": "A quip by the French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte inspired this fair little fowl. Talking about France’s engineering school, the École Polytechnique, Napoleon compared it to a hen that lays “golden eggs.” Those eggs were probably the students, on their way to becoming engineers and military leaders. Bracquemond contributed this image to a book celebrating the school’s hundredth anniversary, in 1894.",
