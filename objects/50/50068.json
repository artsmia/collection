  "text": "Near the end of her life, Joan Mitchell was asked by legendary print publisher Ken Tyler to collaborate on a book project with the American poet and writer Nathan Kernan (born 1950). Enthusiastic about the idea, Mitchell responded with a series of eight brilliantly colored abstract illuminations. Her boldly gestural images are not literal illustrations of Kernan's poems, but instead complement the poet's vivid imagery.",
