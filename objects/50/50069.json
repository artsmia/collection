  "text": "In the winter of 1933, having spent months on her book <i>The ABC Bunny</i> (1933), Wanda Gág was in need of inspiration. To find new printmaking subjects, she wandered outdoors with pencil and paper. When she found a setting, she sketched it day after day to get at its essence. One outcome was this work, <i>Snowy Fields</i>, in which she exposed the underlying rhythms of the hills, trees, and snow-covered ground.",
