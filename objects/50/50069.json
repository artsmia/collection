  "text": "In the winter of 1933, having spent months on her book The ABC Bunny (1933), Wanda Gág was in need of inspiration. To find new printmaking subjects, she wandered outdoors with pencil and paper. When she found a setting, she sketched it day after day to get at its essence. One outcome was this work, Snowy Fields, in which she exposed the underlying rhythms of the hills, trees, and snow-covered ground.",
