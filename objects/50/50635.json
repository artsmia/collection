  "text": "The difference between masculine and feminine psychology is marked, in mythology, by the love between Mars, the god of the war, and Venus, the goddess of love and beauty. The two gods often appear in Renaissance paintings connected with marriage and destined to decorate bedrooms. \r\n\r\nJacopo de’ Barbari’s engraving follows the conventional representation of the two characters, one dressed in full armor, the other in all the splendor of her naked body. Cupid (from the Latin word cupido, “desire”), the god of erotic love, is represented here as an innocent child in the arms of his mother Venus. The trio forms the perfect image of an ideal family, where the father protects and cares for his beautiful, defenseless wife and for his tender baby.",
