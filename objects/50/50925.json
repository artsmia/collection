  "text": "Raimondi returned to the early Renaissance theme of female personifications of virtues in series.  He portrays Prudence, one of the four Cardinal Virtues, as a  graceful, statuesque figure in a niche.  A comparison with Schongauer's Wise and Foolish Virgins illlustrates the different approaches taken by each artist.  Raimondi's aim was the achievement of classical form, through a logical system of hatching and highlighting that concentrates on essential areas of shadow and sensitive illumination of volumes.  Schongauer, working about thirty years earlier, was still concerned with linear contours and elegant details; his figures show a lingering manifestation of the International Gothic style, whereas Raimondi, working in Rome, was constantly influenced by antique sculpture.",
