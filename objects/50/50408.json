  "text": "In this satirical print, the anti-materialistic Wanda Gág scorned commercialism, which she felt was destroying the sense of tradition she held dear. After filling up at a gas station gussied up like a theme park, a late-model car tries to fit through an old covered bridge. A new telephone pole elbows out the lone tree. Billboards compete for attention with a hitchhiking man and boy, reminders that the Great Depression (1929–39) was ongoing.",
