  "text": "Wanda Gág said she was charmed by the way cats “fit themselves into and over all sorts of places and spaces.” Here their blissful pliability contrasts with the hard geometries of stove, logs, and kindling box. Our eye travels from curve to curve around a warm pool of light.\r\n\r\nSurprisingly, Gág had only two cats while making Siesta: Snoopy and Snooky. She sat and sketched their antics on the kitchen floor, then used their various poses for this print. The same cats were her models for her book Millions of Cats ten years earlier.",
