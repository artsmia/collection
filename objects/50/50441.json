  "text": "After Wanda Gág bought a 125-acre New Jersey farm in 1931, she traveled this road to get her milk. Although her childhood had its struggles, milk was one thing she usually had in abundance: her beloved Grandma Biebl drove a milk wagon. (A May 1909 diary entry reported the arrival of butter, cheese, “and two pails of sweet milk from grandma.”) Perhaps Gág’s grandmother was on her mind as she made this print, with its flat, decorative trees and white, milky ribbon of road.",
