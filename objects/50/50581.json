  "text": "By the late 1880s, Bracquemond could draw pheasants in his sleep. His bigger task here was to use thin etched lines to create the illusion of a misty, moisty morning. He achieved a sense of thick, shifting air, where birches materialize through the haze.\r\n\r\nBracquemond’s interest in atmospheric effects links him to the Impressionists. Many of them were his friends, his wife painted in their style, and he participated in the Impressionists’ first exhibition, in 1874. He remained independent, however, following various artistic trends during his long career.",
