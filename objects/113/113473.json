  "text": "Pennsylvania weaver Charles Wiand lived and worked in Allentown and Trexlertown during the mid-1800s. Coverlets with a color scheme and design very similar to this one but with varying woven dates survive in other collections. Clearly, Wiand and his customers preferred this repeating floral and geometric design as well as the striking combination of blue, red, and green wool with white cotton yarns.",
