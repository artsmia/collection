  "text": "A City as Once Seen is a compilation of 27 panoramic photographs taken by Minneapolis-based artist Stuart Klipper during visits to New Orleans over a period of two decades preceding the destruction and extensive flooding caused by Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The images reveal Klipper's affection for New Orleans, celebrating the city's unique blend of cultures, time-worn patina, raw talent and charming flamboyance. Issued in a limited edition of 40 books in 2008, a portion of the proceeds were donated to relief and rebuilding efforts in New Orleans. The slipcase was crafted from scraps of weathered wood salvaged from the wreckage following Katrina, bringing a poignant note to the celebratory tone of the images. ",
