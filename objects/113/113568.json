Boerner, New York, and Danielle Laube, New York).\r\n[1] Considerable confusion exists around the mark, Lugt 1008. In his 1921 edition, Lugt assigned the mark to H. Füssli & Cie, Zürich, a firm run by Heinrich Füssli, IV (1755- 1829), son of the famous painter. He noted that others had assigned the mark to Falkenstein & Haber, Basel, and to Falkeisen & Huber, Basel. In his 1956 edition, Lugt noted that it was indeed the firm of Theodor Falkeisen (1768-1814) of Johann Friedrich Huber (1766-1832), which operated under their names until 1823.\r\n",
