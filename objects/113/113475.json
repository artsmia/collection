  "text": "Originally forged by ethnic Loma and Toma smiths, this type of currency was widely circulated by the Kissi peoples throughout parts of West Africa from the 1850s on. That is why it is commonly known as the “Kissi penny.” The currency could be used singularly to buy small items or tied up in bundles, like this one, for larger purchases. It also played a role during funerals, where it was used to facilitate the passage of the soul of the deceased to the forest of the dead.",
