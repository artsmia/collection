  "text": "Pat Trivigno taught painting at Tulane University, in New Orleans, Louisiana, for 43 years, retiring in 1989. He is best known as an abstract painter, but he actually worked in many styles. He loved the beauty and rhythms of nature. In this study, he employed the free gestures of Abstract Expressionism, a mid-20th-century artistic movement that valued spontaneity and improvisation in art making, to capture the dynamic movement of the horse.",
