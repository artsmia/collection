  "text": "This medieval sculpture of the Virgin Mary breastfeeding her son is unexpectedly naturalistic for its time. Milk was considered refined blood from the mother’s womb, and images of the Virgin breastfeeding the Christ child had theological significance. It was thought the Virgin’s milk, like the blood of Jesus on the cross, had redemptive properties.",
