  "text": "Eugène Delâtre's father was Auguste Delâtre (1822-1907), a renowned master printer who printed the etchings of Delacroix, Corot, Millet, and other leading artists. Eugène's legacy, as an artist and printer in his own right, was the advancement of color etching. The two impressions of Portrait de Huysmans provide a rare look at how he selected and harmonized color to enliven his composition. He was known for emulating the palette of other artists, and he may have seen these pale hues in the etchings of Mary Cassatt, whose work was on view in Paris in 1893.\r\n\r\nJoris-Karl Huysmans (1848-1907) is most famous for his 1884 novel À rebours (Against Nature), based on a fantasy world inhabited by the self-absorbed aesthete Jean des Esseintes. It was audaciously unlike the realistic descriptions of social decline offered up by the \"naturalist\" writers then in vogue. The black cat surely refers to the Parisian cabaret Le Chat Noir, where the literary culture congregated, while the altar signifies Huysmans' conversion to Catholicism in 1892, which affected him so deeply that he eventually became a Benedictine oblate.
