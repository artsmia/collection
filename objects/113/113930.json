  "text": "Many early collectors of drawings stamped the works in their possession with a personal collector’s stamp. This anonymous Italian drawing passed through at least five different collections in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries (see provenance below). Collectors often also annotated their drawings with inventory numbers, price codes, or the names of the artist they thought drew the work. Artists rarely signed drawings before the eighteenth century, certainly not informal sketches like the present sheet. Thus the attribution of this drawing to the Sienese painter Ventura Salimben (1568–1613), which is inscribed on both the mount and the drawing, was made by a later owner. That this drawing was in an Italian collection of primarily Florentine sixteenth and seventeenth-century drawings suggests that it may be Florentine instead. It was in England by the mid-17th century, perhaps as early as 1657, if the star stamp in the lower right corner can be identified with Jerome Lanier, who died that year [see Jeremy Woods 2003]. It was certainly in England before Nicholas Lanier's death in 1666.",
