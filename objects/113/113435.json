  "text": "Men carried their smoking supplies—matches, pipes, and tobacco—in pouches like this one. Beads were long used by the elite of southern Africa as currency. But once scores of European traders arrived, in the 19th century, access to beads became “democratized” and they were commonly used to decorate everyday items. The maker of this pouch was inspired by complex rules of symmetry, the central blue and white line accentuating the zigzag of alternating red and white diamonds. The colors and patterns were dictated by fashion, but presumably they also held meanings no longer understood.",
