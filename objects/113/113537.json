  "text": "Draftsman, painter and printmaker, Claes Cornelisz. Moeyaert was one of the most prolific Dutch artists of his day. Moeyaert’s early style was simple and often rather stiff, and his subjects were primarily history paintings with biblical or mythological narratives. After Rembrandt’s arrival in Amsterdam, Moeyaert’s style became far livelier, his colors more vivid, and his figures more animated. Christ with the Centurion is somewhat transitional in style and was executed in 1632, the year Rembrandt arrived in Amsterdam.",
