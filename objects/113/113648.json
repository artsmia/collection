  "text": "We believe that Joseph-Marie Vien is very likely the author of this drawing, based on comparison with drawings he is known to have made. French academic drawings are notoriously difficult to attribute because of the rigorous, standardized training required of all academy students. And because Vien was also a highly regarded teacher, he had many imitators. Still, features such as the treatment of the drapery, the insistent parallel hatching, the line ends that touch without overlapping, and the chunky hands all point to Vien.",
