  "text": "William Howard was born in Africa and lived and worked at Kirkwood Plantation in Madison County, Mississippi, first as an enslaved man and then, after the Civil War (1861–65), as a free man. This desk was handed down through an African American family, along with the story of William Howard as its maker.\r\n\r\nShowcasing Howard’s ingenuity and technical skill, the desk has a high-style, neoclassical form constructed of rough “make-do” materials, such as Bull Durham tobacco boxes and cotton shipping crates. More than seventy separately made hand-carvings of weapons, tools, eating utensils, trade symbols, and other objects embellish the front and sides.",
