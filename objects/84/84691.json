  "text": "A description of <I>Interplay</I> from company literature addresses many of the practical issues related to casement fabrics. “This unique warp knit construction firmly holds the straw-like yarns in a lacy open filigree, which is flame retardant, sun resistant, soil resisting and easily washed. The dark colors are especially useful in revealing a view while reducing glare.”\r\n<P>\r\nLarsen developed <I>Interplay</I> with the hope of being awarded a commission, which would bring good public exposure to a company that had almost no advertising budget. The design studio had to meet the needs of a new bank in Philadelphia, which had twenty-foot windows ending at the top of a set of doors. This space required stable, nonstretch fabric that wouldn’t interfere with door movement, and the studio chose a synthetic fiber that could be heat set to hold its shape. Larsen did not receive the commission but believed so strongly in the fabric’s merit that <I>Interplay</I> was introduced into the collection and remained a stocked item until 1986.",
