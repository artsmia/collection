  "text": "Landis, named after the artist whose unique handwoven textiles inspired the design, was a popular upholstery fabric that soon became a signature cloth for the company.  \r\nIn developing the design, the studio worked extensively with a Swiss mill to refine the pattern. After a few years of production, the mill altered equipment and could no longer weave this type of cloth. Larsen had faced similar difficulties before and often found a new supply source. The solution for continued production of Landis proved more challenging. Mark Pollack, project manager for this endeavor, worked with a mill in New Zealand and developed a totally new cloth, Landis II, which captured the essence of the earlier Larsen textile and the art that inspired it.",
