  "text": "Since Mandarin ducks mate for life, they became emblematic of marital bliss and conjugal fidelity. And since they don't migrate, they are frequently depicted swimming in icy water--thus symbolizing a committed couple's unity in the face of adversity. As such, this small print was an appropriately auspicious subject for a greeting card. ",
