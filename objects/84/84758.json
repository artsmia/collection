  "text": "Most fashion fabrics are developed to be used as vertical patterns but many of the new nylon knit, Ja-eL designs were intended to be used in either direction or primarily as horizontal visuals.  Oriental Stripe is one of several patterns that highlighted border areas on skirts, dresses and pantsuits.  As a fashion statement Sundown was used almost exclusively as a vertical graphic, but toward the end of the decade when it metamorphosed into an upholstery fabric it was consistently featured in a horizontal orientation.\r\n\r\nThe Larsen archive contains three colorways of Oriental Stripe and five colorways of Sundown.",
