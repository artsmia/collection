  "text": "Bahia Blind is a design that celebrates the beauty of thread. Many Larsen textiles produced in the 1950s and 1960s rely on the quality of the yarn to create dynamic designs. Fabrics such as Bahia Blind, Doria and Haitian Primitive reflect Jack’s feeling that “the tragic loss of the Industrial Revolution was not hand weaving, but handspun yarns.” In 2000, Jack reinterpreted the design concept in Bahia Blind II, a hand woven fabric made in Thailand.",
