  "text": "Jack Lenor Larsen developed Interplay in 1960 as a submission for a design competition. Although it wasn't awarded the prize, the fabric became a very popular design for Larsen. Because the design was inspired by traditional African basketry techniques, it became part of the African Collection in 1963, and was reintroduced in Africa II in two additional colorways, Jet Black and Deep Bronze.",
