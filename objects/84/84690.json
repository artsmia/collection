  "text": "Jack Lenor Larsen developed <I>Interplay</I> in 1960 as a submission for a design competition. Although it wasn't awarded the prize, the fabric became a very popular design for Larsen. Because the design was inspired by traditional African basketry techniques, it became part of the <I>African Collection</I> in 1963, and was reintroduced in <I>Africa II</I> in two additional colorways, Jet Black and Deep Bronze.",
