  "text": "Printed textile production is complex and involves many specialties beyond the development of the graphic image, including everything from screen production to dyeing and finishing.  The Ja-eL/Larsen archives indicate that the introduction of a new fabric such as the nylon knit, <I>Caprolan</I>, presented many challenges ranging from even color application to consistenct replication of the repeat unit. This latter concern was particularly important as patterns had to match when dress components were sewn together.  The white spot in the middle of this panel of <I>Tropic Birds</I> indicates an instance where the dye did not properly bond with the fabric, making the yardage unacceptable for sale.  \r\n\r\n<I>Tropic of Birds</I> was produced in four colorways whereas <I>Parrots</I> was only printed in the form seen here.",
