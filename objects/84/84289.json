  "text": "The \"Coosh Egg\" chair is typical of Valentini's furniture designs, which are generally organic in shape and made of foam or other unconventional materials. Valentini, a graduate of the Rhode Island School of Design, has extended her interest in materials to handbags and women's clothing, her primary pursuits today.  \r\n\r\nWhen closed, the chair and ottoman fit together perfectly to form a circle which, like the egg that is its namesake, can be \"cracked\" apart to reveal a chair and adjoining ottoman. In 2003, Valentini was included in the prestigious Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum's Triennial \"Inside Design Now\" and the \"Coosh Egg\" chair was nominated for the exhibition's Best Product Design award.",
