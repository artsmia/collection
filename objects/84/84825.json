  "text": "The most unusual of all the Ja-eL/Larsen production were the figural animal and bird prints.  Archive records indicate they were primarily sold to Boul Mich, a New York fashion house noted for their new, bold style in the ready to wear market.   The company used poly-knit fabrics for paint suits, dresses and other apparel and focused on a young and inexpensive line. Gerald Pierce headed Boul Mich in the mid 1960's and today is head of the design studio for Jim Thompson Silks in Thailand, a company, like Larsen, that is noted for their high end fabrics expressing the epitome of good taste.  \r\n\r\n<I>Leopard</I> was produced in two colorways and was highlighted in a mid 1960s New York Times magazine section as pictured on this label.  <I>Tiger</I> came in three colorways.",
