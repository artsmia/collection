  "text": "Many of the fabrics the company produced owe their success to the input of several people. Jack Larsen might suggest a source of inspiration, while other designers offered color and technical suggestions. Obelisk, however, which uses overprinting to enrich the color possibilities, is a rare example of a design developed solely by Jack Larsen. The pattern name may have been a company favorite. In 1981 and 1989, the company introduced two completely unrelated printed fabrics using the pattern name Obelisk, presenting an interesting challenge to those cataloguing the Larsen Archive.",
