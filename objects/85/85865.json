  "text": "Geometric motifs and patterns comprise one of the largest categories of design elements used in the creation of African textiles. In Caravan, Swedish designer Anita Askild captures the improvisational quality often present in the African aesthetic. The seemingly random placement of forms and colors combines with variations in size and orientation in a way that encourages the eye to move across the fabric in much the same way that traditional Kuba design does.",
