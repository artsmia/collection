  "text": "A designer’s gift is to see the extraordinary in the ordinary. A woven image of Pope John Paul II provided the inspiration for this piece. An avid gardener, Jack Larsen saw this textile and decided to explore through floral imagery the technical potential inherent in the detail. The end result of the collaboration was <I>Anemone</I>, a 1987 pattern produced in five color ways.<P>  \r\nThe fabric was not a commercial success but is important to the archive because it represents the company’s willingness to take risks. The world of 20th-century textile design is richer for its experimentations.",
