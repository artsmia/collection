  "description": "See individual description below. Early samples probably from school. There were always sample warps on the Structos and other small looms in the studio. Usually natural fibers, one or a mixture, and natural color. None of these were in the line. Cream warp and weft. Very sheer. Warp variation probably manipulated after weaving. Slippery weft.
