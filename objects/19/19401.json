  "text": "This Book of Hours would have been made for a wealthy-but probably not princely-patron. The illuminations are charming and awkward. As is often the case with manuscripts, serious business is accompanied by light-hearted diversion: here, a hunting scene of dogs pursuing a stag accompanies the Virgin's coronation by the Trinity. The illumination and large decorated initial, signal a new section in the book. The opening call and response verses are taken from the book of Psalms in the Latin Vulgate Bible. The readings are for the hour of compline, meaning that they are bedtime prayers.",
