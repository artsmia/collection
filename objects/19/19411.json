  "art_champions_text": "Conservation cost: $3,495\r\n\r\nThe multi-talented Jean Cocteau was among the most vital French artists of the 1900s. As a painter, illustrator, stage set designer, film-maker, and librettist, he ran with the likes of Pablo Picasso, Édith Piaf, Joan Miró, Marlene Dietrich, Salvador Dalí, Gertrude Stein, and Coco Chanel—to name a few famous friends.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Mia’s drawing was at some point glued with rubber cement to a poor quality backing board. Not only do glue residues mar the appearance of the drawing, the backing board risks the long-term stability of the paper. The conservation proposal calls for releasing the drawing from the backing followed by reduction of the rubber cement residues. The result should be improved appearance and stability of Cocteau’s drawing. \r\n\r\nContact the Prints and Drawings Department at printstudy@artsmia.org or (612) 870-3113 to Champion this artwork.",
