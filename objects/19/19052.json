One of the most important entomologists and botanists of her time, she traveled to South America in 1699 to study, collect, and paint exotic specimens.  Merian's depictions of tropical butterflies, moths, caterpillars, and other insects along with their native fruits and flowers were widely published, and served as inspiration for Chinese porcelain decoration.",
