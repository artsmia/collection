Shouxing carries a peach of immortality in his hand and a gourd and sacred fungus – a concoction for a Daoist elixir of immortality – around his belt. He wears a robe adorned with the repeated shou character, standing for longevity.  The border depicts eight Daoist immortals surrounded by flowers that symbolize good luck.",
