  "text": "The Tale of Genji, by the 11th-century court lady Murasaki Shikibu, tells of the romantic Prince Genji and his opulent aristocratic life. The story inspired artists from the moment it was written and exemplifies native Japanese sensibilities. These screens illustrate two episodes from the novel's 24th chapter, in which Genji organizes spring festivities in the garden of Murasaki, his favorite consort. One screen shows the launching of exotic pleasure boats and musical performances. The other pictures the following day, when Murasaki dresses several of her page girls as birds and butterflies and has them dance for the empress.",
