  "text": "An accomplished history and theatrical painter, Claude Gillot also designed numerous stage sets and costumes, with this particular series of fashion plates showing his designs for the royal ballet Les Eléments. The eleven-year-old Louis XV danced in this performance, which would be the third and final ballet he would perform before the court. Gillot today is best remembered as the teacher of the celebrated painter Antoine Watteau, inventor of the fête galante, and Gillot's close association with the popular theater was of fundamental importance in his apprentice's creation of this new genre of painting.",
