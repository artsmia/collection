  "text": "A day in the life of a dandy. Morning: set hair in curling papers; have a cup of coffee; catch up on the cultural scene with William Jerdan’s London Literary Gazette, where reputations are made or massacred. Noon: Don harem pants, macho coat, and tiny top-hat; have smoke; grab riding switch—it might come in handy. Night: tail-coat and tight pantaloons; play guitar and hit the high notes.",
