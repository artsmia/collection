  "text": "For this festival in the Marble Court, the king honors the soldiers who helped secure the victory in the Franche-Comté conflict. A large group of officers carrying muskets circles the courtyard and an elaborately constructed centerpiece, with a giant illuminated column, water fountain, and table with a sumptuous display of fruit. The rest of the attendees are shown standing behind them or looking down on the spectacle from inside the chateau. The print reminds the modern viewer of the militaristic aspect of court culture and fashion at the time. To enter the public rooms and gardens at Versailles, for instance, men were required to carry a sword as a reflection of their gentlemanly rank.",
