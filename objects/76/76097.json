  "text": "First performed at the Paris Opera in early 1674, Jean-Baptiste Lully's Alceste was presented to the king in celebration of his recent victory in the Franche-Comté region. When it was staged at Versailles the following summer, as part of the great victory fêtes, it was performed outside since no large theater existed at the chateau until 1770 that could accommodate larger productions like this one. Given in the palace's Marble Court, the nighttime performance is illuminated by thousands of candles. Louis XIV is depicted seated at the center of the front row, the only member in the audience, as dictated by court etiquette, to enjoy the privilege of both wearing a hat and sitting in an armchair.",
