  "text": "With all his ribbons and gold trim, this gentleman seems to have everything perfect, right? Wrong! That would be too much. Besides, he needs something to set off all his finery; so, he, like many of his contemporaries, pastes a small black patch to his face. Such blots sometimes covered pockmarks, but other times they simply serve to catch our eyes.",
