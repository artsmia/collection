  "text": "The Hypochondriac was Moliere's last play and one of his most famous, since he collapsed on stage while performing it and died just hours later. The comedy was chosen the following year to amuse the king for the 1674 fêtes. A stage was constructed in the soon-to-be-demolished Grotto of Thetis, with François Girardon's celebrated statue group, Apollo Tended by the Nymphs, seen in the central niche of the background, and tapestries, sculpture, and candle chandeliers adorn the space. The king and his companions are seated in front of a large audience of courtiers, who watch the performance and casually converse. Their elaborate hairstyle and dress, and graceful manner-the men with their hats in their laps, the women holding their fans-captures the fashion of the day.",
