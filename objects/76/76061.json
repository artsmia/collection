  "text": "Louise Contat appears as Suzanne, her role in Marriage of Figaro, a play by Pierre Beaumarchais. Thanks to Marie  Antoinette’s patronage, this play enjoyed a private reading at the royal court, but the king found its depictions of class conflict from the vantage point of commoners too inflammatory. The play was banned for three years before premiering in 1784 to wide acclaim.\r\n\r\nThe role of Suzanne launched Contat to stardom. Thanks to her talent, the illustrated fashion press that proliferated her image, and the marchandes des modes who translated theater costume into streetwear, a number of Contat’s costumes inspired popular street fashions. Theater and fashion did more than respond to political change, they paved the way for it.",
