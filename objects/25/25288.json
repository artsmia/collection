  "text": "Recently the Minneapolis Institute of Arts was able to acquire an extremely rare and distinguished French mid-eighteenth-century carved Louis XV frame with a sanded spandrel. Much of its original water gilding is in pristine condition, as indicated by the mellow glow of the burnished gold leaf. This bold but simple frame sets off the refined colors and complex spatial organization of Cézanne's landscape.",
