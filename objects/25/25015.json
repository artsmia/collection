  "text": "What has been a venerated tradition in Spanish culture, the bullfight, is seen here from a modern perspective. Frank obscures the costumed toreador, eliminates human facial expressions, and makes the sword-stabbed bull the focal point of the photograph. In doing so, he offers an unromantic look at a sport that remains popular in Spain, despite outcry against the inhumane treatment of animals.",
