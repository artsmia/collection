  "text": "After developing a serie of molded plastic chairs, the Eameses turned to fiberglass. The \"DAR\" Chair was among the first plastic furniture to be truly mass-produced. Inexpensive, lightweight, and versatile, it was especially popular with young families in the post-war period. The shells were coupled with a wide variety of bases, including the \"Eiffel Tower\" wire strut seen here.",
