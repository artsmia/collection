  "text": "Taken during an extended stay in the northern Italian town of Luzzara, this portrait of the Lusetti family was part of a series later published by photographer Paul Strand in Un Paese: Portrait of an Italian Village. In this landmark book, Strand sought to portray the hardships of life in rural Italy after World War II (1939–45) without sacrificing the dignity of his subjects. His contemplative group portrait conveys the individuality of each family member posed around the doorway to their home.",
