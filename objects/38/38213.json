  "text": "Irving Penn’s portrait of author Truman Capote (1924–1984) is a widely recognized photograph. Taken when Capote was 24 years old and gaining critical recognition for his short stories, the portrait is anything but a celebration of the author’s confidence. With his hands shoved into his pockets, his legs tucked up and hidden in a too-big coat, and his body wedged in a corner of the photographer’s studio, the portrait instead captures Capote’s vulnerability at a pivotal moment in his career.",
