  "text": "Satan the Accuser is cast out of Job's heaven, and with him fall the errors of Job and his wife. They fall into the flames of annihilation-not of everlasting torture, for Blake did not believe in such a hell. Error is recognized is Error destroyed. God is again seated firmly on his throne; he still holds his book, for Law is essential to life; but his halo now contains figures of love and pity, whose attitudes are repeated by the two attendant angels. The fall of Satan has opened a gulf between Job and his friends.\r\n\r\nIn the margins, the flames consume the material creation (as in Blake's Marriage of Heaven and Hell, Plate 14).",
