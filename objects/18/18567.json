  "text": "Couch, a graduate of the Minneapolis School of Art and Design (MCAD), has held numerous teaching positions, and was an early scholar of Native American Studies. His Cherokee heritage often informs the method and subject matter of his artistic practice. In the 1960s, Couch incorporated large patches of intense color into his abstract works. In this work, the sharply defined edges of the different areas of color convey the rugged terrain of the Badlands.",
