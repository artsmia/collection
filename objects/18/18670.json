  "text": "Couch, a graduate of the Minneapolis School of Art and Design (MCAD), has held numerous teaching positions, and was an early scholar of Native American Studies. His Cherokee heritage often informs the method and subject matter of his artistic practice. In the 1960s, Couch incorporated large patches of intense color into his abstract works. In this work from 1962, Couch uses large blocks of red and pinks to convey the essence of painitng--color and form.",
