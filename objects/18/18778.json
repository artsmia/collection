  "text": "The goddess of grains, Annapurna, offers food to her consort, Shiva. Annapurna is richly attired in a dotted red sari and crown, while Shiva stands in stark contrast to her finery with three coiled cobras twisted around his matted hair. A shoulder bag and tiger skin waistcloth identifies him as being in his mendicant form, and his palms are outstretched after receiving food.",
