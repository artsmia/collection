  "text": "The bronze chaser and furniture designer Jean-Louis Prieur was admired for his luxurious Neoclassical decorative arts. Prieur often incorporated pot-bellied putti into his works. Here the playful movements of the chubby bronze figures, shown grasping at the golden leaves above their heads in vain, disguise their function as the candelabrum base. The fine treatment of the gilded bronze lilies, represented in varied states of bloom and with naturalistic chasing--textured matte stems and buds and smoothly burnish petals-- are also characteristic of Prieur's work.",
