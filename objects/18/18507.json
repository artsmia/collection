  "text": "At the end of a day of fishing, the catch is being loaded into a horse-drawn cart. One man lies down next to a beast that may have been used to pull boats onto the shore. Two small groups of women sit mending the nets. Behind them rises a cliff whose crags seem to have fascinated the artist.\r\n\r\nJohn Burgess, Jr. was born into an artistic family. His mother was a sculptor, and his father, a watercolorist. If this is indeed his work, it remains difficult to localize the view since he travelled extensively in Britain and France.",
