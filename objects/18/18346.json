  "text": "Quirt (1902-1968) began his painting career in the 1930s as a Social Realist. Throughout his life, Quirt felt that art should serve society. His earliest works were heavily influenced by Marxian values ---railing against capitalism and the social inequalities heightened by the Depression.\r\n\r\nPrecipitated by his experiences with psycho-analysis, Quirt began to delve into Surrealism and the unconcious. He wanted to tap into his subconscious in order to produce universal symbols through which he could express his Socialist beliefs. By the 1940s and into the 1950s, this Abstract Surrealism can be seen in his work. Man Plus Horse (1960) demonstrates his ability to use line and color to suggest the movements and the dynamism that is felt when rider and horse are one.",
