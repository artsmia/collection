  "text": "Once, when the world was threatened by a demon who could not be killed by any male being, human or divine, the gods imbued Parvati (Uma) with their powers. She became Kali, the wrathful, and quickly defeated the demon. But she did not stop there. Instead, she kept on dancing, threatening to destroy all life. Unable to stop her through brute force, her lover Shiva lay down in front of her, allowing her to trample his body, ending her rampage.",
