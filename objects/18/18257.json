  "text": "The short, feathery lines throughout Wanda Gág’s work show her reverence for the Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh (1853–1890). His tiny strokes and stylized natural forms gave Gág the vocabulary she was looking for to express her exuberant reaction to rural life. In this watercolor on sandpaper, we see van Gogh’s influence in the vibrating trees, angular branches, and ground built up with countless daubs of paint.",
