  "text": "In this chair, the painter used fluid brush strokes and possibly tools to create a grained surface resembling rosewood.  The technique was an inexpensive way of producing a highly decorative object.  The chair was made by turning the front legs and stretchers and joining them with the seat and back saber legs.\r\n\r\nJohn Godley bought a set of these chairs after he moved his family from New Jersey in the 1820s to a farm in Harrison, Ohio, just outside of Cincinnati.  In 1862 the family headed further west to St. Anthony Falls (Minneapolis) and then to a farm in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota.  This was the last known surviving chair from the set when it was given to the Institute in 1964 by Godley's great-granddaughter.",
