  "text": "The classical narrative poem, Nymph of the Luo River, written by Cao Zhi (192-232) is the subject of this elegantly brushed handscroll. The story recounts an abortive love affair between a poet and a river goddess. The verse, one of the standards of Chinese literature, became a favorite subject of literati artists. Attached to the painted portion of this scroll, dated 1591, is a transcription of the Nymph of the Luo River by the late Ming calligrapher, Gu Mengyu, dated 1654. The painting is executed in the \"fine line\" technique called baimiao that matured during the Song-Yuan period (11th-14th century). Although the style demands extraordinary brush control, Wang has creatively alternated areas of dry, textured brushwork with calculated, even, wire-like lineation to add a sense of spontaneity and liveliness to the composition. Only a few paintings by Wang Shanggong reside in western collections.",
