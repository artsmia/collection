  "text": "The classical narrative poem, <I>Nymph of the Luo River</I>, written by Cao Zhi (192-232) is the subject of this elegantly brushed handscroll. The story recounts an abortive love affair between a poet and a river goddess. The verse, one of the standards of Chinese literature, became a favorite subject of literati artists. Attached to the painted portion of this scroll, dated 1591, is a transcription of the <I>Nymph of the Luo River</I> by the late Ming calligrapher, Gu Mengyu, dated 1654.\r\n<BR>\r\n<P>The painting is executed in the \"fine line\" technique called <I>baimiao</I> that matured during the Song-Yuan period (11th-14th century). Although the style demands extraordinary brush control, Wang has creatively alternated areas of dry, textured brushwork with calculated, even, wire-like lineation to add a sense of spontaneity and liveliness to the composition. Only a few paintings by Wang Shanggong reside in western collections.",
