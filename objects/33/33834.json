  "text": "Among the most elegant shapes associated with early porcelain production are the rare, shallow barb-rimmed bowls developed during the late Tang and Five Dynasties period (9th-10th centuries) at Ding and Ding-type kilns in North China. During the Five Dynasties era (907-960), Ding kiln technology reached a high state of refinement resulting in light, thinly potted, porcelaneous ware of pure, white color. These four-pointed flower-shaped bowls were most likely inspired by Tang (618-906) gold and silver vessels that were used by the aristocracy. The high artistic level and liveliness of Ding ware made it popular with the middle class, high officials, and imperial household alike.",
