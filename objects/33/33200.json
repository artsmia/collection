  "text": "Ewers for wine, water, and tea made with bulbous bodies and short molded spouts were common during the Ly and Tran dynasties. Celadons of various colors were popular during this time. A mere trace of iron oxide will impart some color to the glaze ranging from light yellow and green to olive green and blue green. The body of this vessel is carved with a floral pattern that allows the celadon glaze to thicken in the recessed designs creating a slightly darker olive green color that sets the design off from the body.",
