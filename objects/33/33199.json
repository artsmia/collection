  "text": "A strong relationship exists between Vietnamese monochromes with carved, incised or molded decor and the Chinese tradition of <I>ch'ing-pai</I>, a porcelaneous stoneware featuring a thin, light blue, nearly white glaze. Large quantities of <I>ch'ing pai</I> were produced as far south as Kwangtung province which borders Vietnam. This shallow bowl and the saucer dish next to it featuring molded dragons in its cavetto, are very close in glaze, color, and thin potting to the Chinese prototypes.",
