  "text": "This charming screen illustrates paired birds amid flowering plants. The birds represent marital happiness and fidelity, while the flowers create a paradisiacal setting. Such screens were commonly used to decorate the women's quarters within traditional Korean households. Family of humble means would hire itinerant painters who rendered colorful, naive scenes such as those shown here, whereas wealthy families might employ professional painters whose style was much more precise and finished.",
