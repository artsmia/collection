  "text": "This small painting is in visual agreement with its narrative poem. A single figure has ascended to a promontory rising above a mountain temple overlooking a vast landscape. The inscription reads:\r\n\r\nOn the single path winding back and forth\r\nI ascend the blue-green peak,\r\nWhile my kin sits among clouds and birds\r\nin the shade of pines;\r\nRegarding each other without wearying\r\nI arrive to sit at a distance,\r\nFor with green lotus alone\r\nhow can my music be appreciated'\r\n                                                        \r\n                                                   Mei Chong\r\n\r\nMost likely based on some specific place in the famed Huangshan or Yellow Mountains of Anhui province, Mei Chong has drawn his inspiration directly from the awesome wonders of his natural environment rather than art historical lineage.",
