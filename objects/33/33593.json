  "text": "This small painting is in visual agreement with its narrative poem. A single figure has ascended to a promontory rising above a mountain temple overlooking a vast landscape. The inscription reads: On the single path winding back and forth I ascend the blue-green peak, While my kin sits among clouds and birds in the shade of pines; Regarding each other without wearying I arrive to sit at a distance, For with green lotus alone how can my music be appreciated' Mei Chong Most likely based on some specific place in the famed Huangshan or Yellow Mountains of Anhui province, Mei Chong has drawn his inspiration directly from the awesome wonders of his natural environment rather than art historical lineage.",
