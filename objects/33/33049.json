  "text": "This exceptionally rare seal box was made in the imperial Chinese workshops for presentation to a Tibetan hierarch, possibly Sakya Yeshes (1335-1445). The container is decorated in the engraved gold technique (<I>qiang jin</I>) with a mythological creature called a <I>qilin</I> reclining in a sparse landscape. The auspicious mythical beast is regarded as an emblem of divine justice and the embodiment of princely virtue. The cover is decorated with stylized cloud motifs and is attached by a pair of gilt bronze hinges at the back and a bronze hasp in the front decorated with engraved lotus blossoms on ring-punched grounds. \r\n\r\nIt is known that large, elaborate seals were among the gifts bestowed on a number of Tibetan dignitaries who traveled to China for audiences with the Xuande(r. 1426-35) and Yongle(r. 1403-24) emperors. The association of the mythical <I>qilin</I> image with both divine justice and virtuous rule made it an appropriate gift for political exchange. While several Yongle period sutra covers with this type of gold decoration have recently come to light, only a few lacquer seal boxes of this technique are known and this is the only recorded example with <I>qilin</I> decoration.",
