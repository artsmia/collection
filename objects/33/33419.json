  "text": "Domenico Tiepolo was the son and collaborator of Giambattista Tiepolo. He brought a nervous energy to his drawings, which he often produced in long, thematic series. This is one of many drawings that he made of angels and putti. Over the course of the series, whose full extent has never been counted, he showed the weightless, winged figures in free-floating poses. They appear to have been made simply for his own enjoyment, an outlet for his energy and imagination.",
