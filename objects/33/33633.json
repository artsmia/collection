  "text": "According to the preface by Lu Wen-shao (18th century), the Lien-yu chuan was compiled in the Wan-li period (1573-1620) by Wang Tao-kuen who probably oversaw the carving of these well-executed Anhui school woodblocks. The blocks, however, were not actually used for about two hundred years until in 1779 when Pao Ting-po, owner of the Ch'i-pu Tzu Tsai Bookshop, bought them for a considerable sum and produced the first printing.\r\n\r\nThis complete eight volume edition has 310 illustrated biographies of outstanding women. The eight sections are devoted to kind ladies, pious daughters, women of great virtue, women of exemplary etiquette, and women of exceptional honesty. The tradition of moralizing books such as this stretches back to the Han dynasty (206 BCE - 221 CE).",
