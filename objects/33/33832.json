  "text": "The Yaozhou kilns in northern Shanxi province became famous for a high fired, olive-green celadon produced between the tenth and twelfth centuries that is popularly known as northern celadon. These small, hand-formed, foliate rim bowls combine a simple, elegant shape with a monochromatic glaze that exemplifies the understated aesthetic of classic Song ceramics. Celadon is a descriptive rather than technical term. While commonly used in the West, the Chinese do not use the term, preferring instead \"greenware.\"",
