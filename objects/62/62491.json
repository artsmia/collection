  "text": "In the artist's book Death of Hektor, Hayter and Irish poet Brian Coffey (1905-1995) dramatically reinterpret Homer's epic tale from The Iliad. Rather than embrace the traditional view of Achilles as the embodiment of honor, glory, and fame, Coffey and Hayter portray the Greek hero-warrior as a violent and vengeful soldier--his mindless and brutal actions during and after the murder of the Trojan prince Hektor belying his tragic hero status. In this, they challenge the glorification of the culture of war--violence, destruction, and death--elevating the importance of a morally-conscious Hektor, while stressing Homer's deep insight into the human condition.",
