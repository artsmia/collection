Benkei is a wise and powerful warrior-priest who is charged with the protection of the general Minamoto Yoshitsune. Disguised as mountain priests they try to escape north through various checkpoints. At the last one, Benkei lies to be collecting money for a temple and the officer in charge of the checkpoint demands to see the list of supporters. Benkei takes an empty scroll and invents their names, successfully convincing the chief guard to let them pass.",
