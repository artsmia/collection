And Moses took with him the bones of Joseph…The Lord went before them in a pillar of cloud by day…and a pillar of fire by night…\"\r\n(Exodus 13:18-21)\r\n\r\n\"Led by Moses and Aaron, the people of Israel form a joyful parade out of Egypt.  Each carries precious possessions.  Miriam gives music to the march and the flaming pillar forms the direction out of fleshpots to freedom and the Promised Land.  Pessach celebrates the awesome Exodus from Egypt.\"\r\n\r\nText from The Seven Festivals portfolio",
