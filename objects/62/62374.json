  "text": "A strong gust buffets three travelers, forcing them to bend this way and that. Gray diagonal lines suggest rain is also falling on these unfortunate travelers. They are hurrying to a farmhouse whose thatched roof can be seen in the hill ahead of them. Zeshin carefully observed the postures and movement of human bodies and created this comical but realistic composition.\r\n\r\n",
