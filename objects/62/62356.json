  "text": "Japanese tea masters prized the simple, unpretentious beauty of everyday wares produced by Korean potters at the Karatsu kilns on the southernmost Japanese island of Kyushu. This small cup-shaped dish, called <I>mukōzuke</I>, was used to serve an appetizer of raw fish or marinated vegetables. The term <I>mukōzuke<I> describes their placement (<I>zuke</I>) on the far side (<I>mukō</I>) of the serving tray—away from the guest. Bowls for rice and soup were placed closer to the guest on the tray. Typical of wares from the Karatsu kilns, this <I>mukōzuke</I> is decorated with casual, rapidly painted designs in iron-oxide brown—in this case a simple bridge over flowing water.",
