  "text": "Japanese tea masters prized the simple, unpretentious beauty of everyday wares produced by Korean émigré potters at the Karatsu kilns on the southern-most island of Kyushu. This small cup-shaped dish, called <I>mukōzuke</I>, was used to serve an appetizer of marinated fish or vegetables. The term <I>mukōzuke</I> describes their placement (<I>zuke</I>) on the opposite side (<I>mukō</I>) of the serving tray--away from the guest. Bowls for rice and soup were placed closer to the guest on the tray. Typical of wares from the Karatsu kilns, this <I>mukōzuke</I> was decorated with casual, rapidly painted designs in iron-oxide brown. \r\n\r\n",
