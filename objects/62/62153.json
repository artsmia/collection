  "text": "Elaborately carved heads such as this one were mounted on poles and used to mark territorial boundaries. Called rahui, each head served as a warning to trepassers that they were entering the land of another clan. The face is carved into a stern, serious expression, befitting its role as a cautionary signal. It used to have shell inlay in its eyes, which gave them lifelike flash and fire.",
