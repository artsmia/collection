  "text": "In the spring of 1922, Shinsui began designs for the first large-scale series of beautiful women with the publisher Watanabe: Twelve Forms of New Beauties. The plan was to issue editions of two hundred and release one print per month, starting in June. However, by May 1923 production was not finished. Shinsui designed the tenth beauty in June and the eleventh in July. The tremendous devastation of the Great Kanto_ Earthquake, on September 1, delayed things further, and the twelfth beauty did not come out until December.",
