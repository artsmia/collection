  "text": "“Step on it”—the bold graphic on the base of this scale—urges people both to use the machine and to get going. The phrase alludes to the fast pace of life, especially in 1920s New York, as does the scale’s shape—a commanding skyscraper. Two chrome hooks on the sides hold a user’s belongings, ensuring a more accurate weight reading. The person’s weight and fortune are printed out on a ticket, for the cost of a penny.",
