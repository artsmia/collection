  "text": "Although this design, with the tube atop the cabinet, was already popular in France and Italy, Philco came up with the Princess model, utilizing more cutting-edge technology, for the American market.  With the Princess, the tube is several inches shallower than the earlier European models and allows for a more streamlined silhouette. The innovative, freestanding Princess, with its prominent television tube, allowed it to be viewed as an element of industrial design rather than as a piece of furniture. Although it helped rejuvenate the American TV industry, the mechanics proved to be unreliable. ",
