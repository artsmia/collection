  "text": "Television was the ultimate consumer product in the decades following the Second World War (1938-45). Increasing prosperity and the growth of leisure time, combined with mass production and affordability made the television a fixture in 90% of homes in the United States by 1960. Most manufacturers enclosed the bulky cathode ray tube responsible for the moving image on the screen in wooden cabinets styled to match contemporary furnishings. Philco’s “Princess” television did away with the cabinetry by mounting the streamlined tube, which could swivel right and left, on a table that called to mind a lady’s vanity. What more could a princess want'",
