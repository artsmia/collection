  "text": "Hon'ami Kōetsu, a calligrapher, ceramist, painter, lacquerer, sword connoisseur, and tea master, was one of the most influential artists of the early Edo period. Tawaraya Sōtatsu was a renowned painter who drew inspiration from handscroll paintings popular among the aristocracy during the 11th and 12th centuries. Both men belonged to a class of wealthy, educated merchants who socialized and catered to the Kyoto nobility. They often collaborated to create books and scrolls featuring classical Japanese poems on decorated paper. Using luxurious materials including metallic pigments, Sōtatsu painted casual images on the papers, over which Kōetsu wrote calligraphy in his distinctive, elegant script. This hanging scroll features a poem from the Shinkokin wakashu, an imperial poetry anthology compiled in the 7th century. Such works, with their aristocratic associations and lyrical sentiments, became popular among tea enthusiasts in the early 17th century.\r\n\r\n<P><I>Layer upon layer of snow settles over the garden.\r\n<P>Chancing upon footsteps crossing my path, <P>I wonder who has come to visit?</I>",
