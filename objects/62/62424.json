  "text": "This print represents spring in this series. The woman’s red inner robe, revealed by its collar, and her bright pink kimono imply that she is quite young. In Japan, as in other cultures, spring is associated with youth. The pattern of the kimono suggests meisen, a fabric made of plain-weave raw silk that has stenciled or woven designs (from pre-dyed warps and wefts). Considered fashionable and modern, meisen often featured bold non-traditional patterns like these interlocking red and white squares.",
