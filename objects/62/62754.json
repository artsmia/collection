  "text": "Meticulously rendered in subtle gradations of ink and light colors, this rare handscroll successfully conveys the illusion of an underwater realm of aquatic creatures and plants in which fish move freely and happily about. The exceptionally accurate descriptive detail, based on the direct observation of nature, can be traced to the naturalism first encountered in Song dynasty (960-1279) plant-and-animal paintings.\r\n\r\nThe subject matter here is symbolic, however, and is rooted in philosophical Daoism. One of the best-known stories from the Daoist classic, the Zhuangzi, describes two men walking by a river. Seeing fish swimming freely in the water, Zhuangzi remarks to his Confucian companion, \"Huizi, the fishes are happy.\" The rationalist Huizi argues that Zhuangzi cannot possibly understand the feelings of fish. Zhuangzi retorts that true understanding should be acquired intuitively by observing nature, accepting its power, and living harmoniously with it. The obvious freedom of the fish allowed them happiness. Huizi, a Confucian-trained man obsessed with logical explanations, was unable to grasp the point.",
