Almond trees blossom, gardens are transformed into playful places, and a joyful procession of planters goes out to renew the Land singing with enthusiasm, 'Thus march the planters, with a song at heart and a shovel in hand, from the city and from the village on Tu B'shvat.'\r\n\r\nText from The Seven Festivals portfolio",
