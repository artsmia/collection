  "text": "Although not as well known as other painters from Delft, whose guild he entered in 1613, Cornelis Jacobsz. Delff was admired by his contemporaries for his singular depictions of kitchen interiors, the earliest of which dates to 1597. However, this composition is not simply a kitchen still life, but also an allegory of the four elements, with earth, water, air and fire represented by vegetables, fish, birds and metallic vessels forged in the furnace. This picture probably dates to c. 1600, making it the earliest Dutch still life in the permanent collection.",
