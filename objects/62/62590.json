Here, as in the land of Israel, winter is synonymous with blooming citrus groves, spring with lovers, summer with seaside play and lush vineyards, and autumn with the gathering of fruits.  The holiday is a celebration of conclusions and beginnings, of the incredible cycle of nature and human life.\"\r\n\r\nText from The Seven Festivals portfolio",
