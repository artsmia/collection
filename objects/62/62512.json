  "text": "Mori Kansai was the grandson of Mori Sosen (1747–1821), who was famous for his paintings of monkeys—including a work hanging nearby. Kansai chose the same subject for this painting, but his approach was much looser and more spontaneous. Kansai used a wide, flat brush and did not render the hair as finely and meticulously as his grandfather did.",
