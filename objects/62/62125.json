  "text": "Bearing a cyclical date of 1353, this rare ceramic ink stone is carved in the shape of a low table. The work accurately suggests a softwood furniture form popular in the Sung (960-1279) and Yuan (1280-1368) dynasties. Block-like ink stones were popular from Sung through Ch'ing. They were heavy enough to make the ink-grinding easy, and their tall sides easily accommodated carved designs or inscriptions. While it resembled tuan stone, ceramic stoneware was a less expensive material, and this ink stone, while important for its carved subject and inscribed date, is considerably less refined in its carving than the later stone example shown here.",
