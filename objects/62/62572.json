  "text": "According to tradition, in the 11th century Lady Murasaki began writing her famous novel, The Tale of Genji, while seated on a veranda at Ishiyama Temple, on the shore of Lake Biwa. The sight of the harvest moon rising over the lake inspired her. Thus, for most Japanese, Shinsui’s view of a full moon shining on an empty covered veranda at Ishiyama Temple evokes thoughts of the famous author composing her novel of courtly love.",
