  "text": "This is the first of twenty-one beauty prints Kotondo designed between 1929 and 1934. The woman’s undergarment has been allowed to slip off one shoulder as she smooths powder onto her neck, recalling Hashiguchi Goyo_’s <i>Woman Applying Powder<i> of 1918. With her hair arranged in a loose chignon at the nape of her neck, this woman is clearly a modern beauty.",
