  "text": "Located north of the Nihonbashi commercial district, the area called Kanda was home to many craftsmen. Kon'ya-chø, literally \"street of indigo makers,\" was dominated by professional dyers. Because indigo is a natural insect repellent, indigo dyed cloth was favored by people who worked outside all day such as carpenters and gardeners. It was also used to make towels because they held up to repeat washing without fading. In this print, Hiroshige depicted the wooden frames used to dry the dyed cloth. Narrow strips of cloth in a variety of blue hues can be seen hanging from them. They blow in the wind like banners. In the background, the watchtower of Edo castle rises above the surrounding trees in the shadow of Mount Fuji. \r\n\r\n",
