  "text": "The title Twilight refers to the time of day, but pictorial details in this print are related to summer. The woman wears a pale blue kimono with an overall fishnet pattern. Blue was a popular color for summer, visually conjuring coolness during Japan’s notoriously hot and humid months. The fishnet pattern, too, contributes to the sense of freshness because of its association with water. The round object in front of the woman is a non-folding fan (uchiwa), a common accoutrement in summertime.",
