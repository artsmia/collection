  "text": "Act 2 of Chñshingura is comprised of entirely fictional subplots. One of these involves the star-crossed young lovers, Konami and Rikiya. Konami's father, Kakogawa Honzø is the chief retainer of Momoi Wakasanosuke, who suffers the abusive behavior of Moronao at the shogun's court. Trying to help his young immature lord, Honzø bribes Moronao, thus diverting a confrontation. However, Moronao redirects his anger at Enya. In this print, Honzø is shown cutting a pine branch in the garden in the background. Rikiya, the son of Øboshi Yuranosuke, Enya's chief retainer, who later masterminds the revenge plan, comes to visit Momoi's mansion to deliver his father's message. The print shows Konami serving tea to Rikiya, who is seated inside the room. At this point, they have no idea how the fate involving their fathers would turn against their love.",
