  "text": "This painting depicts the death of Sakyamuni, the historic Buddha, in 438 B.C. The Indian prince turned sage is shown lying on his side, having delivered his final teachings. Creatures from far and wide have come to bid him farewell, including the spirit of his mother, Queen Maya, who descends from the heavens (upper left). Not understanding that the sage, through his enlightenment, has escaped the suffering incumbent on repeated deaths and rebirths, holy men and animals alike weep and writhe in grief.",
