  "text": "Built on the shores of Edo Bay, the city of Edo was defined by a network of rivers and canals that served as major thoroughfares for the transport of people and goods. Bridges thus provided vital links for travel and communication and were an important element in the city's evolution into a thriving metropolis. \r\n\r\nDepicted here is Mannen Bridge located in the northeast area of the city. Flowing under the bridge is the Onagi River, one of the many waterways that lead to the Sumida River that runs through the center of the city. The bridge was built high above the water so that boats and ships could pass underneath, bringing goods and foodstuffs from the neighboring provinces. Although Hokusai's design focuses on the structural beauty of the bridge, the throng of people crossing it suggests the liveliness of the area.",
