  "text": "In the seventh month, on the first day of the month, you shall observe a sacred occasion.  \r\n(Numbers 29:1)\r\n\r\nAn angel presides over the four seasons of the year captured in the balance of four leaves.  Here, as in the land of Israel, winter is synonymous with blooming citrus groves, spring with lovers, summer with seaside play and lush vineyards, and autumn with the gathering of fruits.  The holiday is a celebration of conclusions and beginnings, of the incredible cycle of nature and human life.\r\n\r\nText from The Seven Festivals portfolio",
