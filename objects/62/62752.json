  "text": "One of the most memorable designs from Hokusai’s famous Fuji series\r\ndepicts Mount Fuji next to the thick trunk of a gigantic cedar tree— a\r\nYatate Cedar (yatate sugi) that extends far beyond the top edge of the\r\nimage. Such a composition testifies to Hokusai’s powerful imagination,\r\nas there is no historical evidence that such a location with this view\r\nexisted. It is generally believed that this location is the Kagosaka Pass,\r\nsouth of Lake Yamanaka, but no such tree is recorded to have stood\r\nthere. 25 kilometres (15.5 miles) north of Kagosaka at the Sasago Pass,\r\nhowever, there is a tree that still stands today, believed to be 1,000 years\r\nold. In volume seven of Hokusai’s Sketches (Hokusai manga), he provides\r\ntwo separate images of Mount Fuji and the Sasago tree, from which\r\nMount Fuji is not visible. It seems that Hokusai decided to merge both in\r\norder to create a new and powerful, albeit imagined, view of Japan’s\r\nholy mountain for this design.",
