  "text": "Gaston Duchamp liked literature so much that he adopted the name Jacques Villon, after the early French poet François Villon. Usually regarded as a Cubist printmaker, Villon took a surprising turn with the prose poetry of Max Jacob, who had died in 1944 in a German prison camp. Clearly enchanted with Jacob's comical-mystical verse, Villon created small abstractions using multiple plates superimposed over faintly drawn lines.",
