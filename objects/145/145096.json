  "text": "The Scheiers were trained in industrial pottery through Works Progress Administration programs in Tennessee. By 1939, they opened their own pottery in Glade Spring, Virginia. In 1940, the University of New Hampshire offered Edwin a teaching position. There, he and Mary produced hundreds of wares, often decorated with Ed’s expressive human figures, animals like the fish shown here, or abstract sgraffito decoration. \r\n\r\nThe Walker Art Center, which was a prominent proponent of postwar architecture, design, and craft, added pieces by the Scheiers to their collection starting in the late 1940s. In 1953, the Walker featured them in its Design Quarterly publication, alongside Bernard Leach, Warren MacKenzie, and MacKenzie’s first wife, Alix, who collaborated with him on pots.",
