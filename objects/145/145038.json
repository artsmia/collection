  "text": "The Natzlers were famous for their division of labor: Gertrud created delicate vessels while Otto handled the firing and invented vivid glazes. Their works were sold in Vienna and shown in the 1937 International Exposition in Paris, but under pressure from the Nazi Party—owing to their Jewish heritage—they emigrated from Austria in 1938. Settling in Los Angeles, they continued their astonishing creative output, eventually producing some 25, 000 ceramic vessels.\r\n\r\nThe Roots have collected over a dozen of the Natzlers’ exquisite pots, which makes it difficult to choose which to display here. The folded bowl shows the lightness of Gertrud’s clay bodies with a high green glaze, and the Primavera plate features a speckled, matte glaze, offering a range of their creativity.",
