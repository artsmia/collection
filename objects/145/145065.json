  "text": "Pharis studied ceramics with Warren MacKenzie at the University of Minnesota in the early 1970s, which encouraged him to make a living at pottery. (He opened his first studio within two years of graduating in 1971.) But his work, while still largely functional, soon evolved from the typical mingei expression embodied by MacKenzie. Pharis has worked in earthenware since 1992, using paper patterns at first and then CAD (computer-aided design) to guide his process. His pieces are hand built, not wheel thrown, and his geometric panels distinguish his work. \r\n\r\nPharis served as chair of the art department at the University of Minnesota from 1998 to 2004, reaching other generations of ceramic artists including Maren Kloppmann, whose wall sculpture is also shown in this gallery.",
