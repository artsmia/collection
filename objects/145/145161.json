  "text": "A woman walks along a misty road while carrying a small pail. This snapshot photograph was taken by Sharon Day, a woman nationally recognized for her activism on behalf of HIV-related health care and environmental justice, as she participated in an environmental awareness campaign. Day became concerned with the protection of waterways throughout the continental United States, understanding them as sacred to life and the health of future generations. In the early 2000s, she developed the Nibi Walk (nibi is “water” in Ojibwe) as a central feature of her water activism and as an act of faith. As water walkers, Day and companion activists carry a pail of clean water from the headwaters of a river to its mouth, offering prayers of thanks for the nourishment of the earth and all living beings.",
