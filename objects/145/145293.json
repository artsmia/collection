  "text": "Anthony Hernandez’s 1980 photograph is a portrait of Los Angeles. Hernandez’s photograph focuses on a quotidian activity, a moment of reflection, amid what may be considered Los Angeles’s uninviting landscape. The woman at right stares into the distance, drawing attention to the desolate urban plaza before her. Through Hernandez’s lens, however, the lone sitter is as central to Los Angeles as the cityscape itself.",
