  "text": "In this intimate self-portrait, Helen Oji depicted her bathing and self-care routine. Oji came of age during a time of intense feminist activism, and she made this work while she was finding her voice as an artist, as a woman, and as a third-generation Japanese American. Those aspects of her identity reveal the image’s power. In 18th- and 19th-century Japanese prints, women bathers were cast as erotic subjects often intended for the male gaze. Oji’s reclaiming of this subject was an assertion of self-empowerment.",
