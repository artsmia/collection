  "text": "Inspired in part by Cubist forerunners, Judith Rothschild’s abstract paintings and collages are a delicate balance of color, shape, and texture. Created in 1947 when the artist was 25 years old, Mechanical Suspensions is a vibrant and harmonious composition that evokes a sense of rhythm and movement. With its suggestions of the human figure, the composition invites viewers to explore the subtle interplay of forms and materials.",
