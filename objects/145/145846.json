  "text": "Vining patterns in shades of green emerge from five hearts. The central heart is blue, the top hearts, each in a corner, are green, and in the bottom corners are two yellow hearts. White wings attached to the upper portion of each heart.  The middle panel is boldly geometric, with a predominant vertical zigzag pattern forming the composition. The hearts have been turned sideways and flattened. The bottom pattern grounds the subject as a tree of life; from a single vertical stem are green branches with heart-shaped leaves growing from each. The leaves are further elaborated with additional floral forms",
