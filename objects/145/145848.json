  "text": "The top panel is a ariel view of an estate, with wandering paths that link in the center. The middle design panel, is distinguished by clear green diagonal lines, with only hints of the meandering lines of the top panel visible in the brown petal form contained within the structured diagonals. The red square in the top panel that defined the house location has been turned 45 degrees and become a diamond pattern repeated regularly throughout the middle panel. The diamond pattern is reintroduced again in the quilled moccasins at the bottom, but in blue. The orientation of the moccasins, toes pointed up, takes the eye directly to the top panel, joining the two across the decorative divide.",
