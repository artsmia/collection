  "text": "Throughout the period of Hindu Buddhist civilization in Java (ca. 7th C  15th C CE), both Buddhist and Hindu temples adopted the Indian architectural trope of the guardian figure, which flanked the entrances of temple complexes to protect the power of the inner sanctum and mark the threshold between the sacred and profane. This sculpture of a Dvarapala (Dvara meaning “door” and Pala meaning “protector”) was carved in the round from a soft volcanic stone indigenous to the Indonesian island of Java. In kneeling form (associated with Buddhism) and firmly grasping a club, Dvarapala’s with fierce expressions (i.e. bulging eyes, glaring fangs) became increasingly popular with the rise of tantric (ritual) practices during the rule of the Mahajapidt dynasty (1293 1526) in East Java, resulting in a profusion of forms intended to ward off evil spirits.",
