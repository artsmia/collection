  "text": "On the Indonesian island of Java, Buddhist and Hindu temples both adopted the Indian architectural trope of the guardian figure. These statues flanked the entrances of temple complexes to protect the inner sanctum and to mark the threshold between the sacred and profane. This sculpture of a Dvarapala (dvara meaning door, pala meaning protector) was carved from a soft volcanic stone indigenous to Java. With their fierce expression (bulging eyes, glaring fangs, firmly grasping a club), Dvarapalas became increasingly popular during the rule of the Majapahit dynasty (1293–1526) in eastern Java.",
