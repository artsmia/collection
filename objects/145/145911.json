  "text": "Renowned for her large-scale installations and monumental outdoor sculptures, Alice Aycock creates art inspired by the visual and conceptual intersections of fantasy, science, imagination, and experience. For Aycock, drawing lies at the heart of her creative practice, offering both a physical and conceptual space for working and reworking her ideas. She challenges conventional representation with unique ways of rendering three-dimensional forms in two-dimensions. Accessing ideas from architecture, mapping, and design, Aycock learned how to draw plans, elevations, and axonometric, isometric, and oblique views, which became the tools for her spatially based experiments. As seen in this unique print, Aycock upends expectations with playful shifts of perception, presenting a dynamic vortex of whirling shapes and objects she selected from a book entitled \"Cook's Tools.\"  Aycock invites audiences to abandon conventional ways of thinking and collaborate in determining the meaning of her work. Valuing art as an experience rather than an object, Aycock encourages viewers to \"imagine oneself into another place.\"",
