  "text": "Matthew Brandt is known for experimenting with photographic processes. For AgXMH6, Brandt first made a gelatin silver print of trees at the Murphy-Hanrehan Park Reserve in Savage, Minnesota, and then coated it with several layers of chemicals and liquid metals, including  silver. The resulting reflective surface is a means for Brandt to bring viewers into the mirrored frame and share with them his own experience of being lost in a forest.\r\nFrom left to right:",
