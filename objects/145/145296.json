  "text": "Matthew Brandt is especially invested in experimenting with photographic processes. For \"AgXMH6,\" Brandt first made a gelatin silver print of trees at the Murphy-Hanrehan Park Reserve in Savage, Minnesota, and then coated it with liquid silver. The resulting reflective surface was a means for Brandt to quite possibly engulf those approaching this work, and others from the series \"Silver,\" and share with them his own experience of being lost in a California forest.",
