  "text": "Donna Garcia’s series Indian Land for Sale confronts the legacy of the 1830 Indian Removal Act, a legislative agenda to forcibly remove all Native people east of the Mississippi River to territories in present-day Oklahoma. Throughout the ensuing decade, the violent expulsion of Native people from their ancestral homelands—a forced march of a thousand miles resulting in the horrific suffering and death of countless men, women, and children—allowed federal and state governments to auction Indigenous land to white settlers. Garcia’s Muscogee evokes the terror of dislocation from the perspective of a descendant—an avid archival researcher and photographer denied the clearest view of her ancestral heritage due to state-sponsored genocide.",
