  "text": "In her provocative four-image Tanning Project series, mixed-race Native Alaskan artist Erica Lord disrupts colonial narratives through pose and gesture. By transferring phrases such as “Indian Looking” and “Colonize Me” onto her body to be revealed post-tanning, Lord challenges assimilationist ideals and white settler notions of racial hierarchy. Lord’s photographic performances upend time, opposing the false binaries of the “historical” Native American and the “futuristic” mixed- race woman. This twofold inscription, both text and tan, externalizes the complexity of Indigenous identity.",
