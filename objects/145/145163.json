  "text": "The boundaries of the reservation follow the subject and artist Zig Jackson as he stands in San Francisco’s China Basin district, next to a sign that announces the rules of “Zig’s Indian Reservation.” His satirical occupation ques- tions the legitimacy of reservation borders and disputes the notion that “Indian” and the urban environment are mutually exclusive. As the artist asks, “Why do I have to go and photograph Indians on a reservation? Why can’t I be my own Indian on my own reservation?",
