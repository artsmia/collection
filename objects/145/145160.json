  "text": "In late 2016, protesters at the Oceti Sakowin camp, located along the Cannonball River on the Standing Rock Indian Reservation, in Standing Rock, North Dakota, stood quietly in defiance of the impending Dakota Access Pipeline project. Russel Albert Daniels photographed the scene amid a blizzard, which helped to illuminate the security lights coming from the pipeline construction site. In an interview, Daniels spoke about the eerie glow that settled over the protest camp that night, and how he viewed the backlit illumination of the camp as the “strength, resilience, and power of the Indigenous movement. They’ve had everything against them and they’re still alive.”",
