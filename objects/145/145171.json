  "text": "Photojournalist Camille Seaman has dedicated her professional career to, in her words, “capturing photographs that articulate that humans are not separate from nature.” In a series devoted to the fast-eroding coastal ice off the west coast of Antarctica, Seaman created an indelible—if not outright apocalyptic—image of a gore-tinged sunset. In this startling scene, dwindling shards of ice float atop dark crimson water, the coastline a distant bruise on the horizon. Without any captioning, Seaman’s photograph presents the catastrophic implications of rising ocean waters for all the earth’s living beings.",
