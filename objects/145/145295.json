  "text": "This portrait of a samurai leaning on his sword and holding on to a wall of bamboo during his last breaths shows a member of the Shōgitai, a group of former Tokugawa retainers who were opposed to the new government of the Meiji Emperor. In 1868, the Shōgitai samurai fought in the Battle of Ueno against the Imperial troops and lost badly. This painting is a result of the artist, Yoshitoshi, witnessing this battle.",
