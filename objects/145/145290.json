  "text": "As a collaborative book project nurtured between two artists–one who identifies as a straight, cisgender, male photographer, and the other as a nonbinary interdisciplinary artist–this vividly hued and imaginatively constructed book also reflects a decades-long friendship founded in the punk and skateboarding scenes in Boston, MA. As such, the book itself is a kind of portrait within a portrait: a depiction of one artist’s journey into fuller self-awareness and gender identification, and an intimate portrayal of a platonic relationship between two ardent collaborators, both of whom are eager to create space for relationships that are so uneasily categorized.",
