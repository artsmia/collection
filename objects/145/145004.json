  "text": "Lukens’s work is experimental in material and surface, and modern in form—so much so that it is hard to believe he and Bernard Leach share a birth year. Lukens, born in Missouri and educated at Oregon State University and the Art Institute of Chicago, was inspired early on by Egyptian glazes and, after moving to California in 1924, Native American pottery. He started the ceramics department at the University of Southern California, in 1933, and innovated for decades. This early stoneware plate, with its “Egyptian Blue” glaze and gold leaf rim, exemplifies how unhampered he was by tradition—which delighted his students.",
