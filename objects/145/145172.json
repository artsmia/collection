  "text": "Joe Jones was an activist and artist who promoted the value of worker's rights and detested Jim Crow laws. He worked in his time to support equitable efforts through his work. In the 1930s the US Government commissioned him to make murals on the theme of farm labor. He chose wheat farmers. He was inspired by the many aspects of their work and the process of seeing what was involved from seed to table. This print was a stand alone work inspired by the experiencee. He noted, The aesthetics of doing one's work is to me the most beautiful rhythms imaginable-- the way a man who knows and enjoys his work, pitches wheat or ties sacks...or paints as we do, knows the real joy of living a purposeful life.",
