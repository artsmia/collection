  "text": "The winter scenery surrounding the river in this painting is depicted using the so-called reverse saturation method, meaning that the background, including the sky and the river, are painted with light ink, while other areas, including the mountains, riverbank, treetops, and the boat itself etc. are left unpainted. This gives the impression that these spots are covered with snow. The depiction of the fishmen is vivid. Especially noteworthy is the subtle and very skillful rendition of smoke rising above the frozen river from the charcoal brazier on board the river skiff.\r\n\r\nFishermen are popular subjects in Chinese painting, and depictions of them fall into two genres: paintings of recluses in the guise of fishermen who have withdrawn from society and live on boats in secluded environments, and paintings of real fishermen, such as this one. In compositions depicting the lives of fishermen, the fishermen are generally shown at work, as carefree people who, when their work is done, can spend their time at leisure and enjoying nature. The theme of “fisherman-recluse” (known as yuyin, “reclusion in a fishing boat”), however, concerns eremitism rather than fishing. Those seen on boats are not fishermen but scholar-recluses who are escaping an official career, fame and other social burdens.",
