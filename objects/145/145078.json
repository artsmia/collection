  "text": "A native of Austria, Rie moved to London in the late 1930s to escape Nazi persecution and found a new spirit of experimentation in ceramics. She worked in porcelain and stoneware to great acclaim, including breathtakingly crafted decorative bowls. The conical, dark-brown and white bowl shown here is a classic example of Rie’s thinly potted, neutral-colored, elegant forms with sgraffito (scratched or incised) decoration. Coper, an émigré from Germany, joined her studio in 1946 and their work together produced pieces like the smaller bowl nearby with a celadon glazed interior that offers a sense of discovery to the viewer. Rie taught at the Camberwell School of Art in London until her retirement in 1971, and she became Dame Lucie Rie in 1991.",
