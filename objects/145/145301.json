  "text": "Bathers were a central subject for Erich Heckel throughout his career. “Boys at the Beach, ” executed a year after the close of World War I, is representative of his radical shift in approach following the war. Heckel's young men appear emaciated, stiff, and tentative; the standing figure cradles his chest as though he is cold or feels shame. Rather than enjoying the nature that surrounds them, the men are depicted turning their backs to the sea and the beach and  psychologically distancing themselves from both their world and each other. Heckel’s figures are symbolic of the trauma of the Great War and loss of carefree pleasures that followed.",
