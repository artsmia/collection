  "text": "Mia has a celebrated collection of photography with particular strength in the twentieth century. The quality and rarity of the works within this gift from collectors Fay Gallus and Richard Sweet further strengthen Mia’s holdings in key areas, especially with regard to specific, canonical photographic artists. Objects of particular interest include a rare photographic calling card created by Carleton Watkins, a signed vintage portrait of James Agee by Walker Evans, a wild photographic assemblage by Weegee, and a remarkable early twentieth century print of Paris by Eugene Atget. When taken together, the Gallus-Sweet gift comprises one of the most consequential gifts of photography to enter the collection in the last decade, and expands our capacity for future research and display of the history of photography across the globe.",
