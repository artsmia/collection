  "text": "Oestreich’s version of Mingeisota appealed to the Roots from the very beginning of their collecting years. This large and impressive tenmoku, or iron glazed, platter was one of their first studio ceramics purchases, bought from Pro-Art Gallery in St. Louis around 1990. They purchased the wood-fired Oestreich teapot shown nearby from Javier (Bill) Puig, who was a decorative arts curator at Mia before opening a gallery in the Warehouse District of Minneapolis in the early 1990s, featuring local craft.",
