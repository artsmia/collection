  "text": "Los Angeles native Peter Shire’s artistic career has run the gamut from craft and fine art to architecture and industrial design. In ceramics, he counts many of the artists shown in this gallery as influences: the Natzlers and Wildenhain during his early career; Voulkos, Mason, and Shaw later on. His brand of whimsy earned him an invitation to join the high-profile Memphis design group, which was active in 1980s Milan and is now synonymous with postmodern design. He has used the teapot form to continually experiment with colors, shapes, and stripes, the ambiguity of “teapot as sculpture” or “sculpture as teapot” appealing to his love of absurdity.\r\n",
