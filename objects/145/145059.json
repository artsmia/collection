  "text": "Perez recognizes ceramics as part of a continuum of human history, a manifestation of permanence—of which he is a part. At the same time, he voices solidarity with other types of artists in his home country of Mexico: “The colleagues of a ceramist in an underdeveloped country are frequently the writers, the painters, the musicians, etc., and this makes for a rich exchange; something that many times seems limited in the countries where ceramics has a more defined and accepted presence.” Since the late 1990s, Perez’s work has been increasingly recognized outside of Mexico, and his manipulated, sensuous forms, often adorned with geometric slits or incised decoration, are singular among contemporary studio artists.",
