  "text": "For his series Indian Man in San Francisco, photographer and subject Zig Jackson engaged in mundane activities, seemingly unaware of the camera’s presence. Just as he does not acknowledge the camera, the others in the frame do not seem to acknowledge him, despite his standing out from the average San Franciscan in his war bonnet (headdress). In this way, the awkwardness of his presence—at the bus stop, on the bus—is met with nonchalance and becomes an assertion of belonging.",
