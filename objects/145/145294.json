  "text": "Although dealing with forms that don’t immediately relate to anything recognizable in the visible world, Gramcko never thought of her work as pure abstraction. “There was a time when I worked with hard lines and planes of color… but I don’t consider it to be abstract painting, it is too emotional and has too many inner contents. I believe I am an expressionist painter”, she would say. In fact, in her painting lines and planes of muted colors fluctuate in solid dark backgrounds. But those lines and planes are not rigid geometric forms; instead, they evoke strange organic structures, loosely reminiscent of bones, snails, or fossils. In the Venezuelan artistic scenario dominated by the optical experiments of Alejandro Otero and Jesús Rafael Soto, Gramcko doubts abstraction to be the realm of rationality, introducing to it disturbing archetypal forms evocative of organic life.",
