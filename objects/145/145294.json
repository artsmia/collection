  "text": "Against a dark background, a tissue-like white shape crosses the pictorial space, covering it from left to right. What appear to be holes of different sizes in this shape accentuate the idea of seeing a figure against a background. Two spots of yellow render a three-dimensional illusion in this almost squared composition, highlighting the artist’s interest in sculptural forms. The painting finds itself in a twilight zone between abstraction and representational work, using asymmetric elements that evoke organic structures but are drawn with sharp angles and flat planes of colors. The artist seems to doubt abstraction as a territory of pure rational thinking and bring it back to the realm of life and the real world.",
