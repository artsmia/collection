  "text": "In 2013, video journalist Ossie Michelin snapped this charged photograph with his cellphone and posted it on social media. It shows a confrontation between a single protestor holding an eagle feather and a phalanx of weapon-bearing, black-clad police officers. The image went viral during antifracking protests in New Brunswick, Canada. He later said of the photograph, “It’s gone on to be kind of a symbol. It’s not my picture anymore. It doesn’t belong to me, it belongs to everyone, I guess.”",
