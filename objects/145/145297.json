  "text": "Eleanor Spiess-Ferris has consistently made artwork that addresses the relationship between humans, animals, plants and their linked environment. The Pond uses exaggeration and fantasy to consider catastrophic impacts on the environment. She reflects, I grew up on a small farm in northern New Mexico. In the untamed orchard, behind the house and over the irrigation ditch, I found a place of quite and solitude. This was a world where I could play undisturbed by the world. It was among the overgrown plum trees and the elderly apple trees that I first discovered the mysteries of nature, life, and death. As an adult I return to the orchard in my work. The depiction of nature has become a metaphor for my personal experience and my relationship to the world.",
