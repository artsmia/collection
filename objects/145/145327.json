  "text": "Hank Willis Thomas has mined the photographic archive to explore the interconnected histories of race, identity, and civil rights. “Resting” is based on a photograph by the photojournalist Spider Martin (1939–2003), who joined the Voting Rights March, from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, held in the weeks after Bloody Sunday in March 1965. Martin Luther King, Jr., reclines with other leaders of the Civil Rights Movement, among them Rev. Joseph Ellwanger, John Lewis, Ralph Abernathy, and Coretta Scott King. Thomas’s intervention, through the addition of the mirrored surface, is a potential invitation to contemporary viewers to consider their position in the struggle for civil rights.",
