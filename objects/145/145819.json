  "text": "Dwight was politcally active and outspoken in life and in her work about the gap between the very wealthy and the very poor in the United States. She contrasted works such as \"White Mansion\" in her exhibitions with scenes of the rural poor and people struggling during the Great Depression. Dwight was among a generation of artists eager also to document a wide range of views of what was called \"the American scene\" -- people, places, buildings, work -- meaning the daily life of as wide a swath of society as possible.",
