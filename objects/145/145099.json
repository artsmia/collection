  "text": "In the mid-1960s, Shaw was studying painting and sculpture at the University of California, Davis, when he began moving away from abstraction in his ceramic work and toward replication. \r\n\r\nThrough grant funding, he developed decals that allowed him to create amazing tromp l'oeil (literally, “fool the eye”) pieces from porcelain, using it as a 3-D blank canvas. Canton Collection uses the English name for Guangzhou, an important port for the Chinese blue-and-white porcelain trade in the 1700s. The reference connects faux blue-and-white cups and a jar—all made from porcelain—with a grounding Midwestern literary reference.",
