  "text": "Peter Paone's print series imagines scenes inspired by poet Ambrose Bierce's \"Decalogue\" (1906). That poem was a satire on the Ten Commandments from the New Testament book of Exodus. For instance number 4 is: \"work not on the sabbath days at all, But go to see the teams play ball.\" Number 9 is \"Bear not false witness-that is low-But 'hear 'tis rumored so and so'.\" Paone was amused as much by Bierce's colorful life as his irreverent writing and he invented fantastic, even wittily demonic, images to accompany these new commandments.",
