  "text": "Against a cloud-filled sky a white amphitheater offers protection to a variety of young spring flowers planted on a grassy hill. In the middle panel the white sides of the amphitheater seem to take white wings and arch over flowers and petals that float beneath the protective coverings in small circles. The final panel encloses all of the flowers into jewel like patterns against a white ground contained within a chevron stepped green diamond. White chevrons surround the green diamond, which are surrounded by a blue diamond, similarly enclosed in the white stepped chevron patterns.",
