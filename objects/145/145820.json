  "text": "This arrangement of food on a table might at first glance seem like the work of an artist born hundreds of years ago. Its realist style and careful attention to the look and textures, even weight of its depicted items has much in common with painting of an earlier age. It is however a 21st century painting by an artist who has worked hard to learn the techniques of earlier European painting. The objects gathered here are meant to evoke the sense of taste. Triegel made four more still-lifes devoted to the other senses.",
