  "text": "The swells of a rough seascape illustrated with broad, expressive paint strokes in shades of green, blue, and purple crash into dark piers jutting into ocean away from us on either side of this square painting. The waves span the width of the canvas, starting small in the background and becoming larger and wider as they come towards us. Between the piers, the water turns a dark magenta beneath the seafoam caps of the waves. Railings are silhouetted against the sea along the outlines of each pier and a light tower rises from the pier on our right, its orange lantern shining brightly against the dark indigo of the sky. ",
