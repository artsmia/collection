  "text": "Painted with color ink markers, Caught Hands typifies Christina Forrer's creative approach that draws on her fascination with fables and folklore, often laced with dramatic or sinister content. Featuring her signature style of brilliant color, rich pattern, and fantastical characters with cartoonish features, the drawing displays Forrer's penchant for exploring conflict, while also revealing glimpses of her private world of anxieties, fears, and tensions. Like her large-scale weavings, the drawing defies easy explanations, instead evoking meaning though the viewer's own memories, experiences, and emotional reactions.",
