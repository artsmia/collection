  "text": "In the 1200s and 1300s, Chinese Zen monks visiting Japan and Japanese Zen monks returning to Japan from trips to China, carried with them many prized Chinese artworks like this tea caddy. Small, finely crafted containers originally created to store spices and medicines, tea caddies were used in Japan to hold powdered tea during the tea ceremony. Tea caddies and other tea utensils were often handed down with assorted boxes, silk wrappings, and various kinds of documentation. Sometimes these items were treasured alongside the object itself, because they were associated with a previous owner. An earlier owner assigned this caddy a poetic name reflecting its unique shape—Tamamizu, or “Drop of Water.”",
