  "text": "In this massive turned wood vessel, artist Ed Moulthrop revealed both flame-like and linear patterns of the cedar by using his own specially-designed long-handled tools, as well as his own strength.\r\n \r\nIn order to find specimens this size, Moulthrop sourced near his Atlanta, Georgia, home. Besides the availability, he admired the beauty of local southern woods, including ashleaf maple and white pine, knowing that no two trees—and therefore no two turnings—would be alike.",
