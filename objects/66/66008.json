  "text": "Widely regarded as the first modern artist's book, Parallèlement set the standard for every artist's book that followed. Even today, Pierre Bonnard's sprawling illustrations interpret Paul Verlaine's sensual poetry with unusual insight. Bonnard's model for these rosy-pink lithographs was his longtime lover Marthe de Méligny (born Maria Boursin), whose languorous poses are interwoven with blocks of text with unprecendented freedom and expressiveness.",
