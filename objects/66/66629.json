  "text": "Located in the far northwest of China, the Majiayao culture (c. 3800-2000 b.c.) produced an accomplished painted pottery tradition. Although originally derived from the Yangshao culture, Majiayao is now considered a culture of its own. Many of its tomb sites in Qinghai and Gansu provinces were richly furnished with decorative pottery.\r\n<P>The culture went through an evolution of painted pottery designs that lasted more than a thousand years. During the Majiayao phase (3100-2700 b.c.), when this spectacular storage jar was created, painted decoration had become independent. Designs have a distinctive linear quality with black parallel lines encircling the vessel with fluid and rhythmic movements creating striking graphic effects. The additional use of a white pigment, here effectively used to highlight the design, is somewhat rare. The vessel comes from Gansu or Qinghai province in the upper Huang Ro (Yellow River) basin; probably the most prolific pottery producing area between 4000 and 2000 b.c. The Majiayao region would later produce two other distinct types of painted pottery; Panshan (2600-2300 b.c.) and Mazhang (1200-2000 b.c.), classic examples of which are displayed below and to the left.\r\n",
