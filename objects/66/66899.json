  "text": "Cornelis Ploos van Amstel was a successful timber merchant who also achieved acclaim as an amateur draftsman and printmaker. He developed an aquatint technique in 1760s Amsterdam that convincingly imitated the look of old master drawings. Ploos employed a number of printmakers to produce “printed drawings, ” which were published in large editions that sold for far less than drawings. This example, representing four botanists and a gardener examining specimens, copies a study by Rembrandt’s pupil Gerbrand van den Eeckhout, and was among the 7, 000 sheets in Ploos’s drawing collection.",
