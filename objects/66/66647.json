  "text": "In the 1810s, the well-established publisher Nishimuraya Yohachi issued\r\nfive prints designed by Ryūryūkyō Shinsai (1764'–1820) depicting\r\nlandscapes framed by borders and decorated with Dutch lettering. In the\r\nearly 1830s, the publisher Ezakiya Kichibei apparently acquired the\r\nblocks to Shinsai’s five prints, republishing them alongside five new\r\ndesigns commissioned from Eisen, since Shinsai had already died. The\r\nletters were understood at the time to be Dutch, but they were still\r\nexotic and merely a design element. In fact, not all of them are\r\naccurately written, making the text therefore difficult to make out. This\r\nprint, part of Eisen’s addition, takes the Kan’eiji temple in today’s Ueno\r\ndistrict as its motif, which was constructed in 1625 and went on to\r\nbecome one of the largest temple compounds in all Japan during the\r\nlater Edo period. The island in the Shinobazu Pond still exists today, and\r\nis home to the Benten Hall (Bentendō).",
