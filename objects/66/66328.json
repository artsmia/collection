  "text": "Segawa Kikunojō III (1751-1810) was one of the most popular onnagata (female role actors) of his time. With his distinctive facial features, it must have been easy for artists to create recognizable portraits of him. This also made it all the more interesting to show the actor in different roles and settings. Shunkō's depiction of Kikunojō shows him wearing the white robes and lacquered cap of a shirabyōshi dancer. Kikunojō, likely in his twenties, looks fresh and delicate-fitting for the portrayal of a young female dancer.",
