  "text": "Although Gothic architecture originated in France (c.1140), the English have long regarded the Gothic style and its revival in the1700s as native to England.  The revival craze was simultaneously reinforced by the historical novels of Sir Walter Scott.  Interestingly, a rich interplay of three sensibilities (English, French and Egyptian) coincide in this bracket clock dating around 1820.  The architectonic tower form and pointed arch windows on the sides were paramount in all Gothic revival furnishings.  But, the caryatids at the front corners are modeled on Egyptian mummy cases, and the brass inlay and ebony veneer recalls the revived interest in the work of André-Charles Boulle, the foremost cabinetmaker of 17th-century France.",
