  "text": "German artist Linda Schwarz is known for creating visually complex prints that she develops through the appropriation and modification of existing imagery. Schwarz frequently culls images from art history, pop culture, and linguistic and writing systems as starting points for her visual adaptations. She typically manipulates her images, layering, reorienting, and overprinting to form visual amalgams that can generate unusual or surprising associations.",
