  "text": "The 1888 International Exhibition in Glasgow, Scotland provided an opportunity to boast about the city's achievements in industry, science, and art.  The fair also offered Glaswegians a peek at the more exotic cultures within the British Empire, including Australia, South Africa, and India.  The most popular exhibit at the fair was the Indian Pavilion.  With the help of committees in Bombay, Calcutta, and Madras, the pavilion was designed to replicate a market street in India, and filled with furniture, carpets, fabrics, metalwork, and ceramics.  This tea set was brought from Bhuj, India's westernmost city, and displayed in the Indian Pavilion.",
