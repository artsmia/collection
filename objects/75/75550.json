  "text": "The two Morpho menelaus (Linnaeus) butterflies here are shown life-size. These slow-flying insects had a seven-inch wingspan and with their iridescent wings would have presented a dramatic sight high up in the jungle canopy. In this image Merian chose to illustrate the butterflies on a pomegranate tree. Though not native to South America, the tree had been introduced to Suriname and was quite familiar to her European audience.",
