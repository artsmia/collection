  "text": "This large citron, Citrus medica (Linnaeus), grows as a shrub or tree to about twelve feet tall and was introduced to South America during the sixteenth or seventeenth centuries. Merian commented \"They are candied; in Holland they are baked in gingerbread.\" The colorful insect is the Harlequin beetle, a species found from southern Mexico to northern Argentina. Merian admired it very much, saying; \"The beautiful black beetle decorated with red and yellow flecks shown resting on the fruit was added on account of its rarity to complete and decorate the engraving, although I do not know its origin; I gladly leave it to others to investigate this creature further.\"",
