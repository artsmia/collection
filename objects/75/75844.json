  "text": "Gillray satirizes the rage for transparent, low-cut dresses that overtook women's fashion in the mid-1790s. One contemporary magazine described the fad as \"perhaps the most indecent ever seen in this country. The breast is altogether displayed . . .[the dress] is said to cling so to the figure that nothing can be said to be completely concealed.\" \r\n\r\nThe print also lambasts high-stakes gaming, portrayed here as a decadent habit of the rich. A number of the players are identifiable, among them Lady Buckinghamshire, a notorious gambler and a favorite Gillray target. Her large figure is depicted from behind.",
