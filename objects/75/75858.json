  "text": "Gillray dedicated this print to the Fashionable Ladies of Great Britain, poking fun at the vogue for white muslin dresses. Inspired by the carved drapery of Greek and Roman statues, this loose-fitting fabric was usually worn with a high Empire waist. The neoclassical tea service that is crashing to the floor alludes to other classically inspired trends emerging in London at the time.",
