  "text": "Notable for its size, the inner walls of this steep bowl feature leaf-shaped palmettes united by a narrow, highly abstract mock-Kufic inscription. Two bands of Kufic script in gold appear apposite each other on the rim. Small brown and reddish-brown roundels are positioned between the palmettes and the gold inscriptions animating the overall design.\r\n<P>The texts in this group of bowls are usually brief Kufic inscription espousing Islamic virtues such as charity, modesty, and personal perfection. The writings can also wish blessings on the owner. Polychrome ware featuring apposed palmettes, apposed Arabic inscriptions, and slip-incised patterns like those here, were very popular across central Asia during the 10th and 11th centuries.",
