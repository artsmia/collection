It is struggling with a Red Pipe Snake, also known as a Coral Pipe Snake, Anilius scytale (Linnaeus). This illustration first appeared as Plate 69 in the second edition of Metamorphosis Insectorum Surinamensium, published in 1719. Some scholars believe that it could be by Merian's daughter, Johanna.",
