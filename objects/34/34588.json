  "text": "Shibata Zeshin was one of the few artists widely recognized for his paintings on silk and paper and his innovative mastery of lacquering techniques and design. He championed a technique of painting with lacquer on paper and silk, a difficult process but one that gives an appealing luster to his renderings. Here, a dog is barking at a monkey who sits on the should of its trainer. Monkies were long kept in traditional Japan for the entertainment of humans.",
