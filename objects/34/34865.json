  "text": "The Commedia dell' Arte was a traveling improvisational comedy troupe originating in Italy around 1560. The masked characters probably have their roots in Venice's Carnival and became well known throughout Europe. Harlequin, usually portrayed with a red and black mask and diamond patterned clothing, was one of the best known of the group. J.J. Kändler began designing figurines of the stock characters at Meissen in the 1730s, further spreading their popularity through porcelain.",
