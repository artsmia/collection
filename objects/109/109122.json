  "text": "Everything about this sculpture, from its imposing physical presence to its construction of barbed wire, seems to be threatening and dangerous. Mona Hatoum's use of a provocative material reflects her belief that content should be conveyed through aesthetic and formal elements. She describes her work as being …about presenting the audience with a set of objects and materials that may have certain associations and may bring out general feelings of discomfort or uncertainty, and this will be different for each person.",
