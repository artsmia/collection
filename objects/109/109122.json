Mona Hatoum's use of a provocative material reflects her belief that content should be conveyed through aesthetic and formal elements. She describes her work as being \"…about presenting the audience with a set of objects and materials that may have certain associations and may bring out general feelings of discomfort or uncertainty, and this will be different for each person.\"",
