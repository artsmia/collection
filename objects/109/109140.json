  "text": "The New York Times describes Peter Saul as an artist's artist and a serial offender in violations of good taste. He was inspired by 1940’s comic strip drawings and the painterly style of Expressionist artists such as William de Kooning and Max Beckmann. Saul's use of cartoons and pop-culture imagery situates him among the forefathers of Pop Art, but his pessimistic political satire sets him apart from mainstream Pop styles.",
