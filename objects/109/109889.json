  "text": "<I>i-jusi</I> is the name of an internationally renowned, experimental South African graphic design magazine edited and published by graphic artist Garth Walker.  Roughly translated as “juice” in Zulu, <I>i-jusi</I> was first released in 1995, one year after the end of apartheid in South Africa, as a cultural and artistic response to the country’s newly established democratic state.  For 15 years, <I>i-jusi</I> has encouraged South African artists to remove themselves from the influence of Western aesthetics and create “a visual language rooted in the African experience.”  At its very core, the publication asks the question, “What makes me African'”\r\nThe <I>i-jusi</I> Portofolio features examples of the most iconic images by South African artists who contributed to the magazine during its run, including David Goldblatt, Anton & Mark Kannemeyer, Brandt & Conrad Botes, Brode Vosloo, and Pieter Hugo.  The portfolio consists of 10 lithographs, each signed by the artist, which were selected by designer Garth Walker and art publisher and gallerist Gavin Rooke.  The portfolio is a survey of <I>i-jusi’</I>s long history as well as a condensed visual documentary of South Africa’s artists as they journey through the aftermath of apartheid.\r\n",
