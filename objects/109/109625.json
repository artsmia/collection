  "text": "Andreson was one of the first ceramic artists teaching in California at a time when little instruction and information was available. She taught ceramics at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), beginning in 1936, employing hand-building techniques and low-fire clays. In 1944, she taught herself how to use the potter’s wheel, and then introduced it to her students. Andreson worked in earthenware, stoneware, and porcelain. \r\n\r\nAndreson’s vessels are generally uncomplicated, like this footed bowl with blue-green speckled glaze and chalice with prunts (small projections to help hold the piece, borrowed from Renaissance glass). She saw them as vehicles for her innovative glazes.\r\n",
