  "text": "Shepherds have arrived in the stable in Bethlehem to see the newborn savior king, Jesus. Yet, Annibale has placed a massive wooden post in the foreground to emphasize the division between their earthly space and the miraculous space occupied by the radiant baby, his haloed parents and two angels. Though the shepherds do not enter the holy realm and may well not understand it, they are bathed in the light emanating from Jesus. This is a visualization of Godâ€™s blessing in response to their simple, trusting faith.",
