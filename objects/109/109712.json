  "text": "The Mimbres, a group of people within the Mogollon tradition, lived in southwestern New Mexico from A.D. 1000 to 1150.  The majority of Mimbres ceramics are simple, white bowls with black painted, geometric and pictorial designs.  Some Mimbres bowls, however, have red designs, as in this example.  The color of the designs depended upon how the bowls were fired.  A kiln with freely circulating air would cause the iron ore in the paint to oxidize, rendering a red color, but if the oxygen supply was reduced, the paint would fire black.  The Mimbres depicted a wide range of creatures, including fish, frogs, rabbits, turtles, bats, birds and humans.  Bowls were not only utilitarian but were also ceremonial and accompanied the deceased.  When buried with the dead, a hole was punched through the center, and the bowl was then placed over the face.",
