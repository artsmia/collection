They are also not one moment in time, but several moments pieced together via Photoshop to tell a story. This is seen in the minutia of A Lunch at the Belvedere: three knives under Musharaff's sleeve; each grouping of people is at a different stage of the meal; and the table they sat at was in reality round, but Delahaye has made it straight.
