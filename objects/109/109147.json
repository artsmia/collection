  "text": "Ai Weiwei’s work, whether photography, sculpture, installation, or architecture, is marked by a persistent questioning of Chinese conventions and traditions and is often packed with personal references. Marble Chair is a commentary on the systematic destruction of Chinese culture that began during the Cultural Revolution (1966–76). It is carved from a single block of marble to resemble a traditional yoke-back chair, one of the few objects Ai’s family was allowed to keep when they were sent into exile. Ai’s collaborations with highly skilled artisans, in this case marble carvers, are a means of elevating and conserving traditional skills. As a superb piece of craftsmanship, Marble Chair is also a poignant symbol of China’s position as the world’s largest manufacturing center.",
