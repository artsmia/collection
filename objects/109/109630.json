  "text": "Ehrenreich’s process is unusual—she uses only Danish red earthenware clay, which she prepares herself, purposely leaving some sediment in the clay for a rougher finished product. She fires her electric kiln at a relatively low temperature, producing a dark clay body that when combined with her signature ash glaze creates a richly textured and colored surface. Like Gutte Eriksen, whose work is also seen in this case, Ehrenreich waits until the kiln is at its hottest to throw on a reducing agent, effectively depriving the fire of oxygen. While unpredictable, this technique brings out vibrant colors in the glaze.",
