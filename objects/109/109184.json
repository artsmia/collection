  "text": "The artist Zeng Xiaojun is deeply fascinated old trees, some of which have been struck by lightning yet continue to grow. In this painting, Zeng depicts a gnarled old tree with bare branches in a crisp, dry style. Interspersed with the roots is an inscription, the artist's signature, and a poem composed by an anonymous author during the Eastern Han Dynasty (25 - 220 BCE). The human transience mentioned in the poem contrasts sharply with the sturdy and enduring nature of the old tree.",
