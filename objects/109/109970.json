  "text": "In 2001, in an interview for Japan’s leading ceramic magazine, Honoho Geijutsu, Kakurezaki Ryūichi said of himself, “I do not intend to create something avant-garde in the Bizen style. My works are always functional, and I create ‘crafts’ that are indispensable for everyday life. I think it is important that professional potters should create something in response to the needs of our society. My preference is to be seen as a craftsman whose work is avant-garde, rather than an avant-garde artist.”",
