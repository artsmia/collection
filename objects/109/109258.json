  "text": "This large storage jar is decorated in shades of underglaze blue with an all-over pattern of scrolling lotuses borne on cloud-like leafy tendrils, and superimposed by four shou or longevity character roundels on the shoulder. The four character inscription in underglaze blue adorning the lip of the mouth reads, \"Made in the reign of Kangxi\". The best blue and white porcelain produced under the Kangxi emperor is superb and rivals other Chinese blue and white wares from earlier periods. As demonstrated by this jar, Kangxi blue and white ware is characterized by sophisticated designs and technical finesse. Here, a fine, thin, slightly bluish, silky glaze was applied over a very white body.",
