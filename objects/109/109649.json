  "text": "Throughout his career, Tanaka never wavered from his depiction of life in Japan, but he altered the perspectives he placed his viewer. In this print, he illustrates a sun-dappled road covered by an archway formed by two massive trees growing on either side. The houses on the side and at the end of the road have roof tiles and wooden sides of old architecture. Working with the limited palette of etching, Tanaka conveys the light pouring through the branches by varying the density of the leaves and using a spectrum of grays. One can imagine standing in the middle of the road, between the two trees, listening to the chirping of birds.",
