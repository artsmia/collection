  "text": "Using traditional materials and techniques, Maeda produces functional ceramics with a distinctly contemporary style. Rather than carefully painted floral motifs, as was historically typical among Kyoto potters, Maeda embellishes his surfaces with geometric shapes that often accentuate the architecture of the overall form. And while he employs bright glazes, he usually tempers their brilliance by subtly texturing his surfaces.",
