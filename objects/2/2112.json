  "text": "Throughout the Plains and Great Lakes regions, Native families used to shelter their babies in cradleboards, which combined the functions of backpack and infant seat. With the baby wrapped snugly inside, the cradleboard could be tied to the mother's shoulders or propped nearby while the family worked, ate, or socialized. Often the beautiful covers were made by female relatives of the mother, and a woman might receive several as baby gifts.",
