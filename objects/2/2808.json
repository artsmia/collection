  "text": "It seems harmless, even humorous, by today’s standards of social life. But this painting was meant to moralize about the dangers of drinking too much. Wouwerman infused his peasants with an individuality and naturalness of gesture that leaves no doubt about their drunken behavior: some are skinny-dipping, a few are being helped home, and one peasant is about to relieve himself on a fence post.",
