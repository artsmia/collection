  "text": "As the Khmer influence in Thailand waned in the 1200s, new centers of ceramic production developed under the patronage of independent Thai kingdoms. However, the rich source of clay and sought-after chocolate-bronze glaze remained the same. Some forms, as seen in this well-proportioned globular vessel from the kilns at Sawankhalok, took on a bolder, more minimalist presence. The ceramists at Sawankhalok also produced wares for export, particularly to Java and the Philippines; there, 40 percent of excavated ceramics made in c. 1400sâ€“1600s came from Thailand.",
