  "provenance": "Prince Wenzel Paar, Vienna, Austria;[1] by descent to his relatives, Vienna, Austria. (Wildenstein and Co., New York, New York in 1948); sold to MIA in 1978.\r\n\r\n[1] The sitter was the daughter of Prince Johann Joseph Paar (1719-1792) and Countess Antonia Esterhazy (1719-1771), and the wife of Count Johann Josef Bucquoi (died 1803). The portrait was commissioned by the sitter's brother, Prince Wenzel Paar, with whose descendants it remained for over a century. Vigee specifically recalls the painting in her Souvenirs when referring to the hospitality accorded to her by her Austrian patrons during her stay in Vienna. Upon its completion, the portrait was displayed in the salon of the palace of Prince Paar, where, as the artist herself recorded, its exceptionally vibrant color scheme would have clashed with the white boiseries of the room. Accordingly, green velvet hangings were improvised to soften the contrast, and Prince Paar himself devised a sort of reflecting candelabra to light the picture.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

  "text": "Vigée LeBrun was one of the most important women painters in Europe before 1800. At the age of 24, she executed her first portrait of Marie-Antoinette (1755–1793), Queen of France, and subsequently became the monarch's principal portraitist. Given their close ties, Vigée-LeBrun was forced to flee France following the Revolution. Part of her 12-year exile was spent in Vienna (1792–95), Marie-Antoinette's birthplace. Here she painted Countess Maria Theresia Bucquoi (1746–1818), showing her seated before the picturesque banks of the Danube River. The portrait was made for the sitter's brother, Prince Wenzel Paar (1744–1812). Vigée LeBrun’s memoirs recount that when the painting was installed in the prince's palace, its vibrant coloring clashed with the white-paneled interior. To soften the contrast, the prince deployed green velvet hangings–the harmony was reportedly even more becoming at night by candlelight.",
