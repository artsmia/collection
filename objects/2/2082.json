  "text": "This opulently naturalistic flatware incorporates Japanese motifs such as plants, flowers, insects, and animals. Edward C. Moore, Tiffany's head designer from 1869-1891, had admired Japanese art and design at the 1867 Exposition Universelle in Paris, and began working with his designer Grosjean to incorporate Japanese motifs into Tiffany's projects. Dozens of different animal and plant forms were applied in gold, copper, and bronze decoration over sterling silver.  The distinctive texture and decoration continue on the reverse of each piece, giving the set its Lap-over-edge name.",
