  "text": "During the Kofun period, huge burial mounds were constructed for powerful clan leaders. Clay cylinders and figures, known as haniwa, were placed atop the mound to signify the sanctity of the area and to serve as protectors of the interred spirit and his or her belongings. Extant haniwa represent a vast array of people, animals, buildings, and other objects, providing us with a glimpse of this prehistoric culture. The unique hat worn by this figure suggests that he is an aristocratic male.",
