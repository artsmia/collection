  "text": "Although this doll was made for the market, it has many characteristics of dolls that were produced for Native American children. The alphabet is beaded on the strap of the bandolier bag, probably a reference to education. The doll's clothing is very detailed and the bandolier bag even includes miniature arrows, to teach its owner about traditional life. The other bag is decorated with beaded flowers, a classic design element of the Great Lakes/Woodlands people.",
