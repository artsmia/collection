  "text": "The many nudes in Kirchner's works reflect his interest in sexual freedom and the contemporary cults of nudity and athleticism. He also frequently used the dance atelier to symbolize his own studio, a communal workshop for members of The Bridge (Die Brücke). By combining nude figures with studio settings, Kirchner evoked the frank spontaneity and bohemian sensuality so admired by all the Brücke painters.",
