  "text": "Anishinabe formal clothes often have the combined tactile qualities of soft velvet and hard, smooth bead work and buttons. These leggings are weighted by the beads and are likely well made and strong because they were meant to be danced in. These leggings may have had a matching pair of moccasins and a mid-calf length skirt at one time.\r\n--Andrea Carlson\r\n\r\n\r\nBlack velvet is used as the material and background color for these leggings.  The leggings are another example of the artist incorporating new materials while maintaining cultural integrity.\r\n--Anthony White",
