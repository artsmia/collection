  "text": "This extremely naturalistic flatware service, referred to as the Wrap-around service, incorporates Japanese motifs such as plants, flowers, insects, and animals. Edward C. Moore, Tiffany's head designer from 1869-1891, had admired Japanese art at the 1867 Paris Exposition Universelle, and thereafter creatively incorporated Japanese motifs into many of his designs for Tiffany and Co. The addition of other metals, namely gold, copper, and bronze, highlight the various flora and fauna, and the hand-hammered surface, introduced by Tiffany and Co. at the 1878 Paris Exposition, accentuates the texture of the pieces. The hammered surface and foliate design continues on the reverse of each piece, hence its name.",
