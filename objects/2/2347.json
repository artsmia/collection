  "text": "Finely cast bronze mirrors were a standard luxury good among aristocratic men and women. While the fronts were polished to achieve a reflective surface, the backs were cast in decorative relief and organized around a central domed eyelet to accommodate a cord. As magical solar disks, they were also frequently placed in tombs in the belief that they could illuminate the darkness for the spirit of the deceased.",
