  "text": "There is a preciousness to this pattern that isn't even disrupted by the buttons that are attached to an additional flap. I imagine that after the jacket was beaded the artist decided against sewing buttons over the bead work because it would disrupt the pattern. That, or the vest was too small for the intended wearer. This floral design climbs the front panels of this vest in perfect order, reminiscent of wallpaper patterns. \r\n\r\n--Andrea Carlson",
