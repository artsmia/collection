  "text": "The largest commission of Frank Lloyd Wright's long career was the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo. Wright created the hotel's entire decorative scheme, including furniture, carpets, a silver coffee service, and this dinner service design for the informal Cabaret Room. The first dinner service design was developed in 1922 and used until 1933. Changes were made several times over the years. These place settings--never actually used in the hotel--were manufactured from the original designs.",
