  "text": "In addition to designs painted in cobalt blue, Korean potters between the 1600s and 1800s produced many porcelain objects decorated with underglaze iron brown-designs. Possibly because cobalt was an expensive material, blue-and-white vessels tend to be carefully painted. In contrast, Korean potters display a remarkable freedom in their iron-brown designs. Here, a dragon with a humorously long snout coils around the swelling sides of this robust jar.\r\n\r\n<P>American architect Frank Lloyd Wright (1867â€“1959) was well known for his love of Asian art. Wright once owned this jar and used it to decorate his suite at the Plaza Hotel in New York City.",
