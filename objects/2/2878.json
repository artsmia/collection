  "text": "Ko_no Bairei was a prominent painter in Kyoto during the late nineteenth century. He was a strong advocate of Japanese-style painting at a time when Western realism was increasingly popular among artists. His own works are admired for they fine brushwork and poetic sentiments. Here, Bairei painted melons floating in a gentle stream, an cool and refreshing image appropriate for display during Kyoto's oppressively hot summer season.",
