  "text": "Charles Chevallier was the younger brother of the cabinetmaker Jean Mathieu Chevallier (1694-1768), whose work is better known.  Charles Chevallier, however, practiced in both the rococo and neo-classical styles with floral and geometric marquetry and veneers, and Asian lacquer panels.  This bureau plat, or desk, is one of his more restrained designs in the rococo style with kingwood veneer and gilded bronze mounts.",
