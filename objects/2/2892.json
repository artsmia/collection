  "text": "Charles Chevallier was the younger brother of the cabinetmaker Jean Mathieu Chevallier (1694-1768), whose work is better known.  Charles Chevallier, however, practiced in both the rococo and neo-classical styles with floral and geometric marquetry and veneers, and Asian lacquer panels.  This <I>bureau plat</I>, or desk, is one of his more restrained designs in the rococo style with kingwood veneer and gilded bronze mounts.",
