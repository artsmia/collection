  "text": "In the Andean region the Nazca once called home, barren desert sand dunes plunge into the deep, cold waters of the Pacific Ocean. These waters are cooled by a current which yields some of the richest fishing grounds in the world. Fish and coastal birds appear frequently in ancient Andean imagery. This jar portrays a pelican fishing and catching three mythical killer whales, showing the importance of coastal activities in Nazca culture.",
