  "text": "As middlemen of the trans-Atlantic trade from the 1500s onward, the Kalabari peoples who live in the coastal Niger River delta area were in close contact with Europeans and their two-dimensional images. It seems likely that prints and paintings inspired the tradition of ancestral screens, which began around 1800. Their construction shows knowledge of European joinery techniques, learned from shipsâ€™ carpenters. Reserved for the heads of powerful trading houses, they offered the spirits of the dead a place to regularly return, receive offerings, and follow the business of their descendants. The central figure of the deceased, flanked by two dependents, is shown wearing a feathered masquerade headdress.",
