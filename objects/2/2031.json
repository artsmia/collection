  "text": "With intense realism, and not-so-subtle symbolism, the Holy Family (Mary, Joseph, and Jesus) is caught in a very intimate moment. The young parents are cuddling their child, who for a moment stops suckling and stares at the beholder, heedless of the dove the father is showing him, which alludes to the Holy Spirit. The figures’ grave expressions anticipate the tragedy to come. In particular, the towel picked by Mary prefigures the shroud that will wrap her son after his death on the cross.",
