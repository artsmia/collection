  "text": "Venice was the leading center of the international glass trade during the 1400s and 1500s. Muslim traders imported European glassware to India throughout the 1600s. This distinctively shaped vase, made of clear Venetian glass with enameled decoration applied in India, was probably executed for one of the Islamic courts of the Deccan region.",
