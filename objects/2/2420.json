  "text": "This exuberantly carved, painted, and gilded writing desk illustrates the vitality and luxury of 18th-century Venetian furnishings. Although Venice was declining as a naval power and commercial port, its wealthy residents continued to spend lavishly on their homes. Like other furniture that enhanced these dwellings, this desk has a bold design, intricate carving, and brilliantly lacquered flower paintings. The functional aspects are mostly hidden behind elaborately decorated doors. Opening the top reveals a writing desk. The large door at the front conceals a chest of drawers.",
