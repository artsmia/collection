  "text": "Crazy quilts were very popular during the last quarter of the nineteenth century. They were made from bits and pieces of silk and velvet fabrics and further embellished with decorative embroidery. These quilts present a sampling of the wide variety of fancy fabrics available at the end of the nineteenth century. This quilt was made by the grandmother and great-grandmother of the donor and they personalized it with the inclusion of familiar images and family names.",
