  "text": "With the title C.-C.=Fish, Klee describes the simple act of creation at the heart of this work. According to the equation, he subtracted one C from another C to create the form of a fish; the intersection of the two opposing Cs defines the tail fin. The fish's eye and lateral fin appear through the seemingly random course of a freely-drawn line. As in all of his work, Klee emphasizes the basic elements of form and shape that make up a work of art. Through a simple equation, he reminds us that the process of art making is the most important part of a picture.\r\n\r\nThe notation \"S.cl\" on the mount of the drawing means \"Sonderclasse,\" or \"special class.\" It was inscribed by Klee to identify those works he especially liked.",
