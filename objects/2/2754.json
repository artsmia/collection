  "text": "Chests of drawers with bowed fronts flanked by caryatid figures or columns, such as this one, are often attributed to the Philadelphia area, where a significant number are known to have been owned and made.  The form reflects a strong influence from the French Empire, or Neoclassical style.  This example differs from most in that it is made of maple with rosewood details, more commonly found on Biedermeier style furniture made at this time in and around Germany.  Another unusal element of this chest is the survival of the painted decoration on its columns, sides, and drawer fronts, as well as its original rosewood drawer knobs.",
