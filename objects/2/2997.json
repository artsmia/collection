  "text": "In Bhutanese homes large, firm cushions or low box-frame couches provide comfortable places to take one's rest. Colorful textiles called denkheb function as a type of mattress cover that both protects and embellishes the sleeping surface. The most prestigious form of denkheb originates in central Bhutan and consists of two panels of yathra cloth stitched together lengthwise. \r\n\r\nYathra cloth is a heavy, woolen fabric that features wide bands of weft patterns alternating with colorful stripes. During the reign of Bhutan's second king (1926-52), however, a new style of yathra cloth became fashionable that imitated the designs used in Tibetan rugs. Small, geometric designs cover the surface of the cloth, and the piece is unified with a meander border the encloses the patterning.",
