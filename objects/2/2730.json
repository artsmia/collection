  "text": "Decorated with flowers, butterflies, and groupings of musical motifs, this writing desk reflects a period in which female members of the French aristocracy had become active participants in literary life, and when in particular the writing of personal letters (rather than their dictation to a secretary) would have been part of the daily routine of any lady of rank. As such, the small writing desk may be seen as an ancestor of a tablet computer or smartphone, though definitely not as portable.",
