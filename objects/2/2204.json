His right hand rests on another similar book; a volume of Seneca, which rests on his lap. A narrow black enameled ring encircles his second finger. His blue eyes are directed to the spectator and his white hair is brushed forward over his forehead and above his ears. He wears a high collared black coat, a white standing collar, and white neckcloth. The background is plain and of grayish-brown tones.",
