With this new color palette augmenting the natural dyes gathered from local sources, Navajo weavers created intricate and bold textile designs, pushing the boundaries of color and form while maintaining the distinctive Navajo aesthetic and concept of hózhó, which encompasses beauty, balance, grace, symmetry, and harmony.",
