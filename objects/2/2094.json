  "text": "The Anishinabe Ojibwe people are defined by the woods.  The woods provided everything needed to survive; water, food, medicine, clothing, and shelter.  A lot of the Woodlands people's art contains plant-based imagery.  Their clothing is decorated with patterns from the forest.  They became their environment.  They wore the plants, the leaves, the flowers, and the berries.\r\n\r\n--Anthony White\r\n\r\n\r\nAnishinabe floral patterns are not considered feminine or masculine but are gender neutral. This vest, and ones similar to it, are usually made by women but worn by men to special occasions, like weddings, art openings, ceremonies and performances.\r\nThis vest's bead work is less symmetric in style as the vine meanders. The artist here suggests symmetry by repeating a flower design, often twice, in a balanced way, but there is less uniformity in these elements and the patterns are more freely arranged.\r\n\r\n--Andrea Carlson",
