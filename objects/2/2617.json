  "text": "This well-carved pair of lacquer boxes illustrate scholars in a landscape setting on the top panels, and, on the sides, the eight Buddhist auspicious emblems: wheel, conch, umbrella, canopy, lotus, paired fish, vase and endless knot. Although known earlier, pictorial carved lacquer was perfected during the early Ming dynasty (1368-1644) and remained popular into the 20th century. Beautiful and perfectly executed, covered boxes such as these would have held a variety of small objects in a wealthy household.",
