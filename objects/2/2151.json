  "text": "Beginning in the Muromachi period (1392-1573), Japanese tea aficionados admired the Chinese teabowls produced in Fujian Province, known as Jian ware. The Japanese called them <I>temmoku</I> since they associated the bowls with Mt. Tianmu, in the neighboring province of Zhejiang, where they traveled to study with noted Zen masters. As in this example, the glaze sometimes ran during the firing process, creating a pattern of fine persimmon-colored streaks popularly known as \"hare's fur.\" This basic style of black ware ceramics remained popular in Japan long after it ceased to be produced in China.",
