  "text": "The Arts of Peace is a study for one of two murals originally painted for the Manufactures and Liberal Arts Building at the Chicago World's Fair in 1892-93. Following the Fair, both The Arts of Peace and The Arts of War were given to the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor where both murals hang in the main reading room of the library.\r\n\r\nOriginal documents from the Chicago World’s Fair summarize The Arts of Peace mural:  Every figure seems bent on acquiring knowledge. Even the mother takes time from the care of her babe and becomes an interested listener to words of wisdom. The student, the philosopher, the sage, the maiden and the youth are all represented as worshipers at the shrine of knowledge.",
