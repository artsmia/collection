  "text": "<i>Suzuribako</i>, beautifully ornamented lacquer boxes with compartments for an ink stone, ink stick, water dropper, and brushes, became popular during the Muromachi period (1392-1573). By the Edo period, lacquer artists adroitly combined a variety of materials to produce sumptuous objects of great visual appeal. For this box, the waves and sea spray were rendered in silver, which has oxidized to a pewter-gray color. The moon, too, is a silver disk, and would have flashed brilliantly against the dark background sprinkled lightly with gold flakes.",
