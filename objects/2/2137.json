  "text": "Makonde men and women once significantly modified their bodies in the name of beauty, enlivening the face and framing the features with tattoos, chipped teeth, and a shaved hairline. The modifying occurred at the onset of adulthood as an important step on the path to maturity and cultural belonging. Yet the carved hair comb and barrette on this mask show that not all decoration was permanentâ€”or as painfully acquired.",
