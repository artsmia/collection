  "text": "This pair of encoignures or corner cabinets display characteristics of the early neo-classical style in their restrained forms, ormolu or gilt bronze mounts, and wood veneers.\r\n\n\r\n\nJean-Chrysotome Stumpff, originally from southwestern Germany, came to Paris in 1760 and worked in the rococo and neo-classical styles. He is best known for his dynamic veneer work employing the grains and burls of the thin sheets of wood to create geometric and floral patterns.",
