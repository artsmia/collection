  "text": "This colorful screen illustrates a favorite Japanese seasonal pastime, viewing crimson maple leaves in autumn. Within a curtained enclosure, two luxuriously clothed women, surrounded by their attendants, are enjoying music and refreshments laid out on elegant black and red lacquer serving dishes. On the far left, a group of women heat rice wine (sake) over a small fire fueled by dried maple leaves. A foot soldier announces the arrival of his superior, shown in a blue patterned kimono and plaid jacket on the far right. An elegant folding screen in the background—much like the one on which this scene is painted—illustrates how these objects were used both indoors and out for privacy and protection against the wind.",
