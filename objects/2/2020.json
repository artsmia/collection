  "text": "The Taoist immortal Kinkō is said to have been fond of fish, and to have passed his days making paintings of them. On his 200th birthday, a great carp appeared which took Kinkō on a sightseeing tour of the waterways. He returned carrying a Buddhist scroll exhorting humankind to refrain from harming fish. Ukiyo-e artists updated the Kinkō theme by transforming the wizened old sage into a beautiful prostitute.",
