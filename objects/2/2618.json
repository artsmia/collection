  "text": "Carved lacquer is an exacting medium that involved building up a considerable thickness through the application of successive layers of lacquer, which is produced from the sap of the sumac tree. By alternating the colors in this lengthy layering process and then carving down to a specific depth to reveal the desired color, artisans were able to create multi-colored scenes. The top of this box presents the auspicious character for spring, above a bowl with symbols of wealth and auspicious emblems. This complex motif is found on many other examples of Qianlong period (1736-95) lacquer.",
