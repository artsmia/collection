  "text": "This mask represents Asa, a child-devouring spirit who appears during male initiations to challenge and attempt to frighten the initiates.  As part of the transformation process, boys between the ages of four and fifteen are taught secret information about their group's traditions and ritual objects.  They live in a special house apart from the rest of the village during this time.  When their initiation is complete, a big festival is held and the young men are returned to their homes riding on the shoulders of their fathers or maternal uncles.",
