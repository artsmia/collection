  "text": "Onagadori are roosters specially bred in Japan for their long tail feathers. Here, Shibata Zeshin depicted an extraordinary specimen whose feathers hang to the ground from the rooster's perch on a plum branch. Typical of Zeshin's style, the bird is rendered with superhuman precision, with each feather of its luxurious plumage carefully delineated in lustrous pigments.",
