  "text": "Captivated by the beauty of the shepherd Ganymede, Zeus transformed himself into an eagle and descended to Earth to abduct the youth, whom he then installed as cupbearer to the gods on Mount Olympus for eternity. Differently from most representations, where the mortal shepherd boy is shown overpowered by the formidable eagle, here Ganymede stands upright and engages with the eagle through a gesture of affection and familiarity. This friendly pairing suggests that Ganymede’s ascent to Mount Olympus was not so much an abduction, but a joyful transcendence from the earthly realm to the divine.",
