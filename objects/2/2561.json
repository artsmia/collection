  "text": "Captivated by the beauty of the shepherd Ganymede, Zeus transformed himself into an eagle and abducted the youth, whom he then installed as cupbearer to the gods on Mount Olympus for eternity. In most representations, the mortal shepherd boy is shown overpowered by the formidable eagle, but here Ganymede stands upright and engages with the eagle through a gesture of affection and familiarity. This friendly pairing suggests that Ganymede’s ascent to Mount Olympus was not so much an abduction but a joyful transcendence from the earthly realm to the divine.",
