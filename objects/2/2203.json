  "text": "This pair of ladles demonstrates an evolution in eighteenth-century serving utensils in Boston and Philadelphia. The Revere spoon's shell bowl showcases a popular neoclassical motif and was raised in the traditional manner. In contrast, the smooth bowl of Lownes's ladle was first cast and then applied to a sleek raised handle. Both display bright-cut and engraved decoration on their handles, also favored during this era.",
