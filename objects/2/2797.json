  "text": "This quilt was made by Jennie McMurtrie Morrison in 1880, while she was pregnant with her first child. Working with her mother, Catharine, the two women chose a popular log cabin pattern variation, Sunshine and Shadow. This style was usually made of cotton fabrics but the women chose to use fine silk fabrics, possibly remnants the dressmaker had left over from making their clothes. The two women took advantage of these highly reflective fabrics to enhance the pattern effect of the light and dark colors used to create the design.<P>\r\nThe use of costly materials and the fine condition suggests that the quilt was made as a showpiece to be displayed on special occasions rather than a utilitarian bedcover for everyday use.",
