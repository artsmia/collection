  "text": "This early bowl is typical of Voulkos's functional wares, at which he became quite adept before continuing to challenge himself by deconstructing the functional pot.  In fact, while teaching at the University of California at Los Angeles in the 1950s, he and his students would often challenge themselves to throw a complete teapot--with lid, handle, and spout--within a two-minute limit.  The sgraffito fish decoration on the bowl reflects the prevalent techniques and influences of this period.",
