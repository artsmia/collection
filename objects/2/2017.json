  "text": "This print was originally one of a set of three prints. In each print, a young female attendant accompanies a sumptuously dressed woman who is meant to embody one of Japan's major cities: Osaka (shown here), Kyoto, and Edo. In the case of Osaka, the attendant carries a sake ewer and a cup on a ceremonial serving stand. Her mistress seems to be engrossed in a love letter. Each of the prints also bears a poem that associates a flower or tree with the city. In this example, the poem likens the whitened faces of prostitutes to plum blossoms in early springtime:\r\n\r\nThe setting sun\r\nIn the first month\r\nBrings made-up faces of\r\nPlum blossoms.",
