Dayton, Wayzata, Minnesota in May, 1960; gift to MIA in 1975.\r\n\r\n[1] A letter in the curatorial file dated May 24, 1999 from Joop Joosten outlines a complicated provenance puzzle: \"In 1984, I discovered that your painting was acquired and sold by the Galerie Beyeler in Basel in 1958-59. it was bought from Henryk Berlewi in Paris who should have acquired it from Anatole Jakowski. Galerie Beyeler sold it in 1959 to Mme de Gavardie, an art gallery in Paris. This contradicts the information I got from the Sidney Janis Gallery in New York. This gallery bought the painting in March 1960 from Madame Zervos and sold it in May 1960 to Bruce Dayton. From Mondrian's letters we know only about one painting sold to Zervos in 1932: Composition no II, with Yellow and Blue (cat. rais. no B228).\" The Sidney Janis gallery records are currently sealed.\r\n",
