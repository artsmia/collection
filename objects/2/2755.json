  "text": "The design of these chairs, with a concave crest rail and legs made of Greek crosses, is a modification of the ancient Greek <I>Klismos</I> chair.  Note their resemblance to the Greek chairs featured on the Minton plates (on the wall above), as illustrated by John Moyr Smith.  In 1815 Rudolph Ackermann published a drawing of a similar dining or drawing room chair in his famous <I>Repository of Arts<I/>.  Indeed, these two chairs resemble those from a large set purchased for the Telfair House in Savannah, Georgia and now on view there at the Telfair Museum of Art.",
