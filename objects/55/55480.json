  "text": "Working between São Paulo and Paris for most of his life, Arthur Luiz Piza became one of the most prominent names in Brazilian printmaking. Having practiced print- making under the supervision of Johnny Friedlander early in his career, Piza later created a unique way of using gouges to carve the matrix with hollows deep enough to hold the ink, adding a three-dimensional aspect to his prints. The way he worked the copper plates was similar to the work of a sculptor.",
