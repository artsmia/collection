  "text": "The beautiful ceramics of the Chavin culture are boldly conceived with strong sculptural elements.  Their burnished dark grey and brown surfaces are subtle, allowing the sophisticated artistry of the surface decoration to predominate.  Chavin vessels vary widely in shape and ornamentation, illustrating the value placed on individual expression.  This jar is covered with jaguars, powerful predators that appear frequently in the iconography of South American cultures.  They were commonly associated with high status individuals such as warriors and priests, who would have used a finely made vessel such as this one for sharing of ceremonial beverages.",
