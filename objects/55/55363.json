  "text": "Theologian Martin Buber observed that in the Old Testament, to believe means to follow the will of God. Rembrandt might add, even without visible proof. In this introspective work, in which Abraham is poised to offer up his son, Rembrandt favors hearing over seeing. Abraham's eyes are darkened, and he covers his son's eyes. It is words that prompt the bewildered, uncomprehending look on his face as a voice behind his ear says, Do nothing to him (Genesis 22: 12). \r\n\r\nThe angel, whom the Dutch Statenbijbel (1637) says is God himself, embraces Abraham and protects him with its wings while concealing the substitute ram, barely discernible at left. The salver, no longer needed for Isaac's blood, forecasts Christ's sacrifice in the New Testament.",
