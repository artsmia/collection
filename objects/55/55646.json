  "text": "This elegant box is made up of lobes resembling the petals of a lotus. The scalloped rim of the top is in keeping with late Song and Yuan (13th-14th century) taste for shaped rims also seen in ceramic and silver works. The pewter wires are incorporated both for decorative effect, edge protection, and added strength. The top is inset with an openwork mother-of-pearl medallion carved with three dragons cavorting in clouds. The interior of the box is lacquered red and was probably used for holding toiletries. A lacquer container such as this, with its relatively complex shape, was likely inspired by contemporary silver objects, which had significant influence on the development of both ceramic and lacquer forms during the Song and Yuan dynasties (10th-14th century).",
