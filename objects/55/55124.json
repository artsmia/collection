  "text": "Rembrandt left behind scant writings about himself. His only surviving comment about his art refers to expressing the greatest and most natural emotion. He dedicated himself endlessly to this goal, and depictions of the elderly were an important vehicle for his investigations. The effects of old age fascinated Rembrandt, and these sensitive renderings exemplify his quest to humanize his subjects. Around 1630 there was a lively market for such humble, affecting images, which could be understood immediately, without the aid of biblical or classical texts.",
