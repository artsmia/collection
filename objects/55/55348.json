  "text": "Jerome, the 4th-century scholar who translated the Bible into Latin, described his experience in Rome's catacombs as \"walking in darkness like that of Hell, pierced by rare beams of light.\" This description resonates with Rembrandt's meditations at this juncture of his life. One enters the print as if it were a darkened room. If we concentrate, the details begin to emerge as our eyes adjust. By controlling entry into the image, Rembrandt allowed the print to work on the viewer, gradually revealing its interior mood.",
