  "text": "Illustrators of printed books sought inspiration not just in manuscripts and paintings but also other prints. Although Michael Wolgemut was a leading painter in Nuremberg, he updated his style with a nod to his younger contemporary Martin Schongauer from Colmar, now part of France, whose engravings rapidly circulated throughout Germany. This illustration, extracted from the Schatzbehalter (\"Treasure Chest or Shrine of True Riches for Salvation and Eternal Blessedness\"), is clearly based on Schongauer’s engraving Christ in Limbo (see P.68.256). The author, Stephan Fridolin (1430-1498), stated explicitly that the 96 woodcut illustrations to his account of Christ’s life were meant to aid the illiterate. This woodcut is indicative of the standard of quality when Albrecht Dürer started his career as an apprentice in Wolgemut’s workshop.",
