  "text": "In an early sketch for The Old Rooster, the front foot was shorter. But as Bracquemond began to etch, he exaggerated the toes to show that this old bird still had plenty of fight. Now well into his career, the artist clearly wanted to strut etching’s stuff. He used dense parallel lines for the tail, a dotted technique for the comb, and short, velvety strokes for the back of the head. In preparing the copper plate for printing, he left extra brown ink around the rooster’s eye, adding softness.",
