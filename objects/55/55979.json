  "text": "Busy with commissions for public ceiling murals in Paris, Albert Besnard had never made a lithograph until André Marty recruited him for L'Estampe originale. This scene betrays Besnard's fear of dying young like his father: A woman is bathed in a swirl of light, loved ones, and privilege, unaware of Death lurking at the door. Besnard didn't take to lithography and turned to etching for his other two L'Estampe originale prints.",
