  "text": "Joseph was the favorite among Jacob's twelve sons, which made for some very jealous brothers. As this gathering shows, reactions are mixed as the teenager recounts his dreams. In one, Joseph and his brothers bundled up sheaves of grain, and their sheaves bowed toward Joseph's. In the other dream, the sun, moon, and stars revered Joseph, prophesying his family's veneration of him. Alarmed, the brothers decide to sell Joseph into slavery. As illustrated in Joseph's Coat Brought to Jacob, they soak Joseph's many-colored coat with goat's blood and show it to Jacob to convince him that a wild beast had attacked and killed his son.",
