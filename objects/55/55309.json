  "text": "Abraham was deeply interesting to Rembrandt, who returned to the subject throughout his career. Here Abraham (at far right) ministers to three travelers, extending every hospitality his 99 years will allow. Led by a rotund, turbaned figure of God, the trio brings a surprising message: Abraham and his aged wife, Sarah, will have a child. Listening in the doorway, the old woman is amazed. \r\n\r\nRembrandt departed from Genesis 18 by including Ishmael, Abraham's son born of the servant Hagar. Facing the wilderness with his bow, the boy will soon be exiled, yet live to become patriarch of the Ishmaelitesâ€”identified by some as forebears of the Islamic nations. Rembrandt's print may function, then, to suggest a common ground among various faiths born of the same father, Abraham.",
