  "text": "Both Cranach and Durer lived through the tumultuous early years of the Reformation in Germany, begun by Martin Luther in 1517, and both were converts to the new religion.  Cranach, however, became personally involved.  <P>Cranach was court painter in Wittenberg, where his patron, the Elector of Saxony, was Luther's protector. Also a close friend of Luther's, Cranach produced woodcut engravings to illustrated printed broadsides arguing the Protestant cause.<P>Cranach continued to make etchings throughout his career.  Many of his themes were biblical interpretations, conforming to one of Luther's main tenets in his revolt agains ecclesiastical abuses: the affirmation of the Gospel as the sole guide to righteousness.<P>Cranach was certainly aware of the innovations in Durer's work, but did not fully assimilate them.  Whereas Durer was constantly simplifying and centralizing his compositions, the elements Cranach's compositions remained scattered and highly detailed, as in this example.",
