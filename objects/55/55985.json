  "text": "Like André Marty, Henri Boutet advocated for original prints, particularly etching. He even launched the journal L'Art moderne (1882-83) as a way to send his own etchings to readers, either reproduced or bound inside as original prints. Artistically, Boutet's trademark was la Parisienne, a wistful bourgeois beauty with improbably small hands and feet.",
