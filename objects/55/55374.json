  "text": "Like many artists, Rembrandt portrayed the Holy Family fleeing into Egypt to escape persecution by King Herod. He gave the episode the look of everyday life, with Mary and Joseph in humble dress and consumed by the concerns of parenting. In the nocturnal print, a weary Mary tries to nurse her child, who seems to have fallen asleep. A year later Rembrandt returned to the theme but experimented with a light, delicate etching style akin to drawing. This time the family is assembled on a log, and Joseph pauses, peels an apple, and admires his infant boy.",
