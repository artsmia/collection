  "text": "Old Testament stories proliferated in Germany’s climate of religious reform—in prints, plays, and preaching. Protestant leader Martin Luther prized their simple lessons of suffering, faith, and civic virtue. Here two women claim that a child is theirs (1 Kings 3:16-27). King Solomon threatens to slice the child in two, at which point one woman gives up her claim, proving herself to be the real mother. The triangular composition reinforces the strength of Solomon’s authority.",
