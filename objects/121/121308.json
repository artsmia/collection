  "text": "Bandaged and broken, Eros, the god of love, rests in the tension between the ideal and the reality of the human condition. Strength and beauty is contradicted by inherent fragility. Life is precious because it is fleeting. And love brings both joy and heartache. Mitoraj used the timeless artistic language of Greece to address these conflicts in a new way. They are intimately personal, yet the monumental scale of the sculpture, weighing close to two tons, also suggests the glories and failures of entire civilizations.",
