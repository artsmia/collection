  "text": "Emmi Whitehorse blends the physical with the metaphysical, the real with the imagined in this mixed-media work on paper. Informed by nature’s beauty and Navajo culture, the work takes the form of an ethereal landscape. Its ambiguous, atmospheric space is populated by an assortment of abstract, symbolic, and biomorphic forms that seem to float across a ground of deep, luxuriant color. Seeds, leaves, plants, and dried flowers intermingle with numbers, Navajo signs, and fragments of curved lines. Though neither descriptive nor narrative, the work demonstrates Whitehorse’s fine-tuned ability to fuse disparate elements within a lyrical realm of experience, memory, and contemplation.",
