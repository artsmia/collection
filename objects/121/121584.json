  "text": "This hanging scroll depicts a single egret in shallow water among the reeds, the landscape shrouded in heavy mist. Feeling chilly, the water bird sinks its head into its chest and raises one leg—yet its eyes remain open, ever watchful. \r\n\tLiang Kai was one of the leading academic masters near the end of the Southern Song dynasty (1127–1279). His compositions and subject matter are simple yet animated by spiritual intensity, reflecting the Chan Buddhist principles that value intuition and introspection over doctrine and ritual as paths to enlightenment. Their sketch-like qualities suggest spontaneity, individuality, and immediacy.",
