  "text": "This hanging scroll depicts a lonely white egret standing in shallow water among the reeds. Feeling chilly, the water bird sinks its head into its chest and stretches one leg, yet its eyes are wide open, revealing its watchfulness. Painted by Liang Kai or one of his followers, the painting is simple, yet conveys a sense of spiritual intensity through its connection to Chan Buddhist principles such as spontaneity and immediacy.",
