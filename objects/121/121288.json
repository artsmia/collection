  "text": "This design originated with Raphael, then spread north through an engraving by the Italian printmaker Marcantonio Raimondi. Albrecht Altdorfer added his own twist, switching the emphasis from classical beauty to action. While the Italian Venus dried her foot in self-absorbed reverie, this sharp-featured version resembles a harried hausfrau, impatient to finish her bath so she can respond to the yammering Cupid.",
