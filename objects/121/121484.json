  "text": "Marrow spoons were commonly used by European diners in the eighteenth century for the easy removal of marrow from the bone. They were often made of silver, with a long, thin bowl. Many, such as the present, were double-ended. Hester Bateman—the maker of the larger spoon—was the most prolific female silversmith of her age. During her thirty-year career after she took over her late husband’s workshop in 1760, her silver would have been found in nearly every middle-class household in London.",
