  "text": "People of Early Modern Germany loved astrology, convinced that one’s calling in life was ruled by the planets. Criminals, invalids, and laborers (including artists) all fell under Saturn, then considered the coldest, most distant planet, and the one associated with the onset of winter. Like winter, Saturn was merciless: he ate his sons and killed his father with a scythe. He was also the Roman god of agriculture. Virgil Solis encompassed multiple aspects of Saturn’s power. Raging across the sky in his dragon-drawn chariot, he rules over the winter chores of hard-working laborers, who plow their fields and slaughter their livestock.",
