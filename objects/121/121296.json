  "text": "Juan Fernandez, known as El Labrador or The Rustic, was hugely successful in his lifetime. Using an extremely precise and refined technique, the artist presents an eccentric arrangement of objects in an unusual nighttime still-life. Using an extremely subtle color palette, he shows grapevines, fruits and nuts scattered across a table as if seen by the soft light of the moon or a low-burning candle.",
