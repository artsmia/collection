  "text": "“The smell of the Dutch Republic is the smell of tobacco,” said art historian Simon Schama. When this print was made, smoking was largely demonized, a vice deposited on Dutch shores by seamen. Rather than moralizing, Adriaen van Ostade etched a figure simply absorbed in the pleasure of his clay pipe and bowl, which holds an ember to light the tobacco.",
