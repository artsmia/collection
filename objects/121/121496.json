  "text": "Sebald Beham excelled at finding intellectual subjects to entice German print buyers. It was only in the early 1500s that Italians began sorting their antique ruins to standardize column styles, a job aided by the rediscovery of the ancient treatise of the Roman architect Vitruvius. Beham adapted this design from a 1521 translation of Vitruvius’s De architectura by Milanese architect Cesar Cesariano.",
