  "text": "This headdress is the gift of Jack Garcia, a Lakota descendant of Long Wolf, who led Lakota, Cheyenne, and Arapaho warriors in the victory against General George Custer at the Battle of Little Bighorn, in 1876. Created by a Tsistsistas or Lakota artist, it is a symbol of power, leadership, and generosity. In this same spirit of Lakota generosity, the Garcia family gave the headdress to Mia for visitors to admire and appreciate. At its installation, a Lakota medicine man blessed the object with the family.",
