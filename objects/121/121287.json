  "text": "Heinrich Aldegrever showed his reverence for Albrecht Dürer by imitating his monogram style. He also used the great German artist’s prints as his personal model book. The half-fish triton at left has the same pouty face as Diana in Dürer’s Apollo and Diana (c. 1505), and the long-waisted bodies are typical of Dürer, too. This panel was probably intended to inspire furniture decoration.",
