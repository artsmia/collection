  "text": "This allegory with a mother and stillborn child is among Barthel Beham’s more unorthodox images. The miser’s presence is explained by the biblical inscription, which reads: “The wise man says that an untimely birth is better than a miser who does not enjoy his wealth” (Ecclesiastes 6:3). In other words, if your thirst for money keeps you from enjoying life, you’d be better off dead.",
