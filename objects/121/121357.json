  "text": "The subject of this untitled portrait drawing is Annette Giacometti, the artist’s wife and frequent model. She is shown sitting alone on a stool in the artist’s studio, gazing directly ahead, devoid of emotion or expression, hands folded in her lap. Her figure appears small within the expansive space of the studio, whose vaguely drawn details establish a rudimentary pictorial setting. The drawing focuses on the model, Annette, in particular her face, which the artist has reworked with graphite and erasure, an action that draws our attention, yet provides little additional visual information. For Giacometti, portraits such as this were not intended as psychological or sociological studies, but rather translations of the model’s “otherness,” real-time perceptions that he determined should be interpreted solely by the spectator. Like his attenuated figure sculptures, the portrait drawings often evoke feelings of melancholy, alienation, and loneliness.",
