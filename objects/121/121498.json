  "text": "Since the 17th century, The Eight Views–originally referring to scenic spots around the Chinese Xiao and Xiang Rivers–has been a well-established theme in Japanese art. \r\nHere, the eight locales are taken from famous places in the city of Edo (present-day Tokyo) and are juxtaposed with popular actors in the roles of well-known thieves and robbers. Kabuki plays on the underworld were popular during the mid-19th century, especially during the hot summer months when this series was put on the market, as the storylines were meant to give viewers a chill.",
