  "text": "A medium-size, rectangular painting of a Spanish courtyard with columns supporting an upper-level balcony and a cobblestone floor below. The architecture is somewhat ornate, with decorated capitals on each column. Two donkeys stand in the courtyard, weighed down by panniers. In the background, an arched doorway is flanked on both sides with stacks of basins and other vessels, suggesting that this is a place of work and not simply a site for leisure. The brushstrokes are varied, with detailed attention to the donkey at center but more diffuse treatment of the cobblestones that dissolve at the bottom edge of the painting.",
