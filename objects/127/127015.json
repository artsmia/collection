  "text": "Alexa Horochowski’s monumental “vortex” drawing highlights the intransigent problem of non-biodegradable trash polluting the world’s oceans and its effects on living organisms and marine ecosystems. Horochowski produced the drawing, one of an extended series, using an array of commercial barrel fans to create an artificial wind vortex on a flat surface. She selected a mixture of Styrofoam cups, polystyrene packing peanuts, aluminum cans, and other trash materials coated in substances such as graphite, ink, acrylic, linseed oil, and pigments, and added them to the vortex. The drawings were formed by the wind blowing the debris so the coatings would leave marks on white or black grounds. Though Horochowski chose the drawing constituents and guided the process, the element of chance played a large role in determining the final compositions. These experimental works actually blend aspects of drawing and printmaking, order and randomness. The works appear gestural due to the action of the materials/media within the vortex, but the mark making is mechanical, one step removed from the artist’s hand. Under the artist’s supervision, intention and chance vie for dominance. The drawings are visual compelling, but also carry a vital ethical message about our inadequate stewardship of the planet.",
