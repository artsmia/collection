  "text": "This is the earliest known work by Yoshitoshi, published when he was just 14 years old. Three years earlier he had entered the studio of Utagawa Kuniyoshi (1798–1861), at that time one of the leading print designers in Japan, especially sought after for his prints of warriors. It is therefore not a surprise that Yoshitoshi’s debut would also be a warrior subject. What is unusual is that this debut was a full-size triptych, instead of a smaller-sized print, which was common for young artists.\r\n\r\nThe motif is the defeat of the Heike (Taira) clan in the Battle of Dan-no-ura, a decisive sea battle fought in 1185. The image captures the drowning of the leading Heike members, with Tomomori (1152–1185)—who tied himself to an anchor once he saw defeat was unavoidable—in the center. \r\n",
