  "text": "A scholar in official robes relaxes and contemplates on the bank of a river. A pair of pine trees provides dramatic contrast to the simple orchids and grasses that spring from the ground on which he sits. During China’s Yuan dynasty (1271–1368), the period of foreign domination by the central Asian Mongols, this type of imagery provided imaginative psychic release for Chinese literati, who experienced political and social tensions under foreign rule. This painting, attributed to the famous scholar and painter Zhao Mengfu, represents an early example of this type of imagery. The tranquil scenery and natural qualities of mountains and water serve as a metaphor for the perfect gentleman, who manifests endurance, stability, sharpness of mind, and the flexibility to adapt in the best way to a changing environment.",
