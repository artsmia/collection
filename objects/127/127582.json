  "inscription": "right margin, in black ink: Weegee the famous (Arthur Felling) was a loud-mouthed, cigar-chomping New York bum- and he photographed like it, with a raw honesty and power that has never been matched. I photographed him in his one-room apartment, littered with piles of prints and photographic paraphernalia, a few months before he died, in 1968. He was alone, sad and often incoherent. But his pictures speak on, with Weegee\\'s own true and honest voice.",
