  "text": "This drawing is part of Jenny Holzer’s long-running “Redaction” series of paintings, drawings, and prints that use declassified U.S. government documents to highlight the extremes of officially-sanctioned secrecy, censorship, and surveillance. Holzer typically alters these redacted documents to draw attention to their content. Here, she enlarged the original document and replicated it on vellum (treated animal skin), a subtle but sly allusion to the parchment used by the Founding Fathers to write the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights. In so doing, she exposes the irony of how the constitutionally-guaranteed freedoms of speech, press, protest, and other civil liberties are often the first casualties of government abuses and overreach. Indeed, individuals who fully exercise their rights may themselves become the target of oppression. Holzer has also changed the color of the censor’s redactions from standard black to a brilliant shade of red painted in broad, gestural strokes. The painted passages and dripping pigment not only suggest blood, and by extension violence, but emphasize the very process of redaction as the work of human minds and human hands. The visual effect is powerful, suggesting that the cost of government secrecy is in inverse proportion to personal freedom.",
