  "text": "Mia prohibits visitors from bringing guns and other weapons into the museum, but the weapons in this artwork are not lethal. Mozambican artist Gonçalo Mabunda takes the Biblical injunction “They shall hammer their swords into ploughshares” quite literally. He makes his art with parts of decommissioned and deactivated military equipment left behind in his country, which suffered through a civil war from 1977 to 1992. His \"Mask\" is built around gun butts, rifle chargers, and a hammer, with the eyes made from empty bullet casings. The weapons carry strong political connotations, and the end product invites viewers to reflect on the transformative power of art.",
