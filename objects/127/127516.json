  "text": "In 1891, Georges Lemmen had written of the French artist Odilon Redon, “As a lithographer, Mr. Redon possesses admirable qualities as a technician. He is an admirable colorist in black and white.” Here Lemmen shows himself to be a colorist in brown and white. He takes the most drab of all tones and treats us to a symphony of sunlight playing over wood, brick, stone, plants, and glass. Our eyes can walk like cats atop the maze of garden walls between the rows of houses and outbuildings, and, like cats, we must occasionally pause to look carefully at our surroundings.",
