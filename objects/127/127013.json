  "text": "Starting from the center, as both a vanishing point and a center of gravity, the composition begins as a dense cluster of triangles that mimic the tesserae pattern of a mosaic. This motif radiates outward from the center with varying density, gradually dissipating as it moves further away, creating a dizzying ripple-like effect similar to that of waves reverberating in a puddle. In the past, the artist has likened similar compositions to that of the Big Bang, explaining, “The bubbling, it starts with that, the universe being a big bang from a bubble and the bubble grows— it’s kind of a universe in expansion.”",
