  "text": "This painting fits squarely into Gabriel Orozco’s ongoing exploration of the relationship between natural irregularity and the human desire to impose order. Looking at it, one can become lost between the microscopic and the macroscopic, between molecular structure and the cosmos. A cluster of triangles at the composition’s center radiates outward with varying density, creating a dizzying, ripple-like effect reminiscent of waves on a puddle of water. Orozco has likened similar compositions to the Big Bang theory of the origins of the universe: “The bubbling, it starts with that, the universe being a big bang from a bubble and the bubble grows—it’s kind of a universe in expansion.”",
