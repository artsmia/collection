It engages people of all ages in food-related activities that promote health, culture, community, and land  stewardship through workshops and participation in its three  communal gardens. \r\nFor her portrait of Hope Community, Aliza Nisenbaum  collaborated with its young female leaders, part of two  generations of Somali immigrants who care for the community gardens. Surrounded by symbols of sustenance and self-sufficiency, they and their work embody the bonds of  care between family, friends, and community. \r\n\r\nLeft to right: Nimo Mohamed, Sumiya Olson, Bisharo Jama",
