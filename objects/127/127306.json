  "text": "Upon arriving at Mia, Aliza Nisenbaum, like most visitors, was first met by the museum’s guards. While Mia’s guards represent the museum’s first line of defense against theft and damage to the collection, they also serve a vital role in facilitating the museum-going experience.\r\n\r\nClad in their uniforms, our museum guards are an often- overlooked community unto themselves, some of whom live in the surrounding Phillips and Whittier\r\nneighborhoods. Over the course of her residency, Nisenbaum befriended a number of guards, learning about their hobbies, pets, and life stories during their time together in her studio. Here, six guards are shown at rest in the lounge, a private space where they take breaks and gather before and after their shifts.\r\n\r\nSitters from left to right: Jason Ressler, Desmond Griffin, Bruce Morrow, Katherine Lamb, Gina Carchedi, Jesse Nagamatsu",
