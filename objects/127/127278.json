  "text": "These four illustrated booklets or “art zines” were published to accompany the Hairy Who’s first group exhibitions held between 1966 and 1968. Forerunners of the Chicago Imagist movement, the Hairy Who were figurative artists who drew inspiration from Surrealism, cartoons and comic books, advertising, and vernacular culture. Their eclectic and often provocative work featured distorted cartoon-like characters, irreverent subjects, silly puns and gags, sexual innuendo, satire, and social and political commentary. Styled after comic books, each of the booklets features artwork made especially for the publication by the six members of the group. Part memento, part art project, the publications were inexpensively printed and issued in unknown quantities. Each booklet sold for one dollar. Most have not survived.",
