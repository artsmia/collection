  "art_champions_text": "Conservation cost: $4,980\r\n\r\nBruce Onobrakpeya is one of Nigeria's most important living artists: a printmaker, painter, and sculptor. In his twenties, he began to experiment with forms related to Nigerian myths and legends, themes that stayed with him. In November 2017, Mia received a set of six deep etchings on paper from Cathy and LeRoy Draine, who purchased them in Lagos in the early 1970s. These are the first works by Onobrakpeya to enter the collection. Due to the way they have been mounted in the past, however, the prints are unstable and cannot be safely handled or exhibited. MACC's paper conservators will remove the prints from their current housing, reduce adhesive from the prints, and surface clean the works overall. \r\n\r\nContact the Arts of Africa and the Americas Department at aaa@artsmia.org or (612) 870-3286 to Champion this artwork.",
