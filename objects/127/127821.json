  "text": "This print shows the same fight between the Monkey King Sun Wukong and Princess Iron Fan as another version nearby. However, this is not from a series of prints about just the Monkey King but about storytelling in general which was a form of popular entertainment in the 19th century. Each print is devoted to a famous storyteller and in this case it is Momokawa Enkoku (1851-1922) who was just 17 at the time this print was published.",
