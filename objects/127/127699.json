  "text": "Thierry Oussou has said he appreciates the artistic medium of paper for its fragility—as it easily rumples, tears, and even burns. For Oussou, paper represents the frailty of the human condition. The title of the work, Confidant, refers to his grandfather, in whom Oussou used to confide. Oussou made this collage when he lived in Amsterdam, and his grandfather was dying in Benin, West Africa. Oussou was filled with helplessness—he lacked resources to go back home—and made the artwork as a therapeutic means to deal with his feelings.",
