  "text": "Like the abstract animal-shaped slit gong nearby, this instrument is a so-called “talking drum.” In this case, the carver has made it look like a human face: the slit represents a “mouth,” terminating in “eyes,” which are highlighted by semi-circles. The instrument’s surface shows a beautiful deep gloss, called patina, that is produced by extensive use and age. It was handled for decades by people who had been initiated into a society or association with great political power and prestige among the Ndengese people.",
