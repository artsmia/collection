  "text": "Overlap Square, 1992, is a prime example of the artist’s work. Mel Kendrick’s method involves hollowing blocks of wood. He constructs the parts he cut into new forms on top the shell of the block from which they originated. The geometric shapes of Overlap Square assume a figurative stance. According to artist, “Zigzags, curves, and loops are ways of drawing in wood.” Once constructed, Kendrick overlays paint on top of selected portions of the sculpture. The paint acts like a skin “that indicates the inside and outside and how it’s been pulled apart.”",
