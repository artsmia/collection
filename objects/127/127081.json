  "text": "An artist and self-appointed healer, Felipe Jesus Consalvos earned his living, for most of his life, as a cigar roller. Over the course of his lifetime, he extrapolated the vernacular tradition of cigar band collage to a sophisticated practice. His obsessive body of work (which range from works on paper to musical instruments and furniture) was discovered in 1980 at a West Philadelphia garage sale.\r\nThe Havana-born artist immigrated to Miami around 1920, eventually settling in Philadelphia. Consalvos' work was often playful and subversively political in tone. Begun in the 1920’s, his collages incorporate phrases that comment on racial and sexual difference and evince a deep dislike for George Washington, who almost always appears in drag.",
