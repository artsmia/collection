  "text": "Jan Groth is best known for his decades-long exploration of the relationship between form and field, line and picture plane. He alternates between different media - crayon on paper drawings, metal sculptures, and wool tapestries - but he is best known for his tapestries, which he regards as central to his oeuvre. Groth has said that his work is about \"silence and light,\" and \"the balance between almost something and almost nothing.\" He cites the restrained work of Giorgio Morandi, Alberto Giacometti, and Henri Michaux as important early influences.",
