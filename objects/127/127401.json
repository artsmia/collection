  "text": "These two kimono are examples of kimono made of meisen, a silk cloth patterned by printing or resist dyeing, that was popular in Japan in the early 1900s. In the late 1800s, mechanized spinning and weaving technologies had made possible the production in Japan of lustrous, fine, durable fabric. Meisen textiles were patterned using chemical dyes that were mixed with rice paste and applied through stencils on to warp threads woven with temporary weft threads; after application of the dyes, the latter were unraveled and discarded and the true wefts woven in. This was a speeding up of traditional techniques and allowed for the creation of more complex designs. Relatively inexpensive and often with dazzling, Western-inspired designs, meisen kimono gained popularity among lower and middle class women.",
