  "text": "Niisato Akio eschews traditional surface decoration for his porcelain vessels, opting instead to create patterned openings in his thin-walled vessels using a small drill. The entire vessel is covered in a white glaze before final firing, sealing the drilled apertures but allowing light to shine through. Niisato describes his pieces as “containers for light.”",
