  "text": "Vodou flags (drapo Vodou in Creole) have a special place in the visual culture of Haiti. Originally used at Vodou religious ceremonies, they bear the symbol of an lwa\r\n(or loa), an intermediary spirit between God and humans. The colored flags are an invitation for the lwa to take part in the ceremony and would be carried in procession by the worshippers. This flag is dedicated to the lwa Bosou, represented as a horned man whose strength is used to defeat enemies.",
