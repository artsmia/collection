  "text": "In the 1920s, Eva Auld Watson spent summers in the Berkshire Mountains in Massachusetts, working in the barn-turned-studio she shared with her printmaker husband, Ernest Watson. The Konkapot River, named after a Mohican chief, ran near the studio. This image could represent the creative charge she got from being in this rustic setting. After traveling through a daunting rock formation, the water plows into the moonlight, spreading forth like a glowing mantel fringed in lavender. After printing the white highlights, Watson added a few spatters to the sky for stars.",
