  "text": "Among the final works Morrison created during his six-decade career, this boldly colored, abstract landscape encapsulates the artist’s creative philosophy and aesthetic vision. From his reliance on Surrealist-inspired automatic drawing techniques and expressive use of color, to the prominent horizon line motif and the theme of Lake Superior as both a symbol and source of spiritual knowledge, this drawing operates as a sort of visual and aesthetic manifesto, and fitting homage to Morrison’s distinguished career.",
