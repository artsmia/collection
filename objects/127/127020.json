  "text": "African American sculptor and printmaker Martin Puryear explores issues of identity, culture, and history in his work. Produced in collaboration with master printers, Puryear’s editioned prints generally feature simplified black-and-white motifs that bring to mind traditional craft, manual labor, and nature, subjects he also explores in his sculptural work and site-specific installations. Puryear’s austere images essentially function as cultural or historical symbols whose meanings are fluid and depend on the viewer’s own experiences, memories, and associations. “I think there are a number of levels at which my work can be dealt with and appreciated, ” Puryear has noted. “It gives me pleasure to feel there’s a level that doesn’t require knowledge of or immersion in the aesthetic of a given time or place.”",
