This format was inspired by the horizontal handscroll; Kodōjin mostly employed these for calligraphy works that featured the names of a room or a building and hung over doorways or under eaves. Landscape paintings in this format are unusual, and Solitary Journey of a Recluse is the largest known horizontal landscape painting by Kodōjin.",
