  "text": "Known as xianwenping (‘Vase decorated with bow-strings’), the compressed globular body of this vase is surmounted by a tall cylindrical neck and upturned rim. The shape of xianwenping were inspired by ancient bronze hu vessels of the Han dynasty. This example is striking for its flambé-glaze: the vase is coated with a brilliant blue-colored glaze accented with milky lavender-blue streaks.",
