  "text": "Norval Morrisseau is the founder of the “Woodlands School of Painting, ” a movement that arose in the 1970s in Canada. Woodlands School Painting is known for bold colors and figurative work, largely depicting important creatures in the Anishinaabe world. In this work, Morrisseau centers on depicting a mythical figures and shamans in Anishinaabe creation stories. Shamans have abilities to convene with the divine; Morrisseau himself was a shaman. This work is representative of Morrisseau’s particular style, with attention to crisp lines and bold colors.",
