  "text": "Though her art career spanned only 16 years, Anne Ryan was much-admired during her lifetime for her abstract and semi-abstract paintings, woodcuts, and collages. \"The Window\" feature Ryan’s characteristic “white-line” woodblock technique in which distinct areas of color are simultaneously printed on black paper to establish strongly contrasting forms while also suggesting a nocturnal setting. It is representative of Ryan’s practice, which featured subjects ranging from figurative to still lifes to pure abstraction.",
