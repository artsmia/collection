  "text": "In Islamic Africa, the Qur’anic board is connected with education, ritual, and identity. Its primary purpose is training—it’s used by students learning Arabic grammar, the holy text of the Qur’an, and the art of calligraphy. A board can also be used in healing: a religious specialist writes specific verses in response to his clients’ issues; the ink, washed off the board, is given to the client to drink as holy medicine. This Somali board, or \"loox\", appears to have been used in education. Its two sides show Surah 49, Verses 11-12 from the Qur’an, which warn believers against ridiculing, insulting, and backbiting each other.",
