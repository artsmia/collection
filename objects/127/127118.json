  "text": "The artistic movement known as Art Nouveau was deeply influenced by Japanese aesthetics and, insofar as it impacted the production of French ceramics, developed along two different paths. One lead to the highly refined painting represented by the graceful figure of a woman in the snow adorning Georges de Feure’s vase. The other direction, taken by small pottery workshops or individual ceramicists such as Delaherche, emphasized simple forms enlivened by the experimental application of glazes.",
