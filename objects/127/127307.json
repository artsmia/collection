  "text": "Centro Tyrone Guzman’s Wise Elders Program provides culturally and linguistically responsive services to support the holistic health and independent living of Latino seniors. Elders play an important role in their community, transmitting their wisdom and Latino culture to younger members.\r\n\r\nDuring her residency in Minneapolis, artist Aliza Nisenbaum taught a portrait drawing class to the Wise Elders, asking them to draw each other and their loved ones. Here, the Wise Elders are shown with their own artistic creations against a mural depicting the history of migrant laborers in the Midwest. The painting is a testament to the Wise Elders’ unique character as individuals, their life experiences, and the collective wisdom they impart to their community.\r\n\r\nSitters from left to right: Melissa Benitez, Jesús Cazares, Sol, Juana Gonzales Moreno, Nicanor Torres Marcos, Minerva Cazares, Elena Valencia de los Santos, Roberto Arista",
