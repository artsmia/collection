  "text": "Zhang Fei (Jap.: Chō Hi; d. 221) was a great fighter and one of the so-called Five Tiger Generals during the Chinese Three Kingdoms (220–80) period. He fought for Liu Bei (161–223), who had crowned himself as the emperor of Shu state. In 220, Liu Bei attacked a rival kingdom, Wu, to regain control over the lost state of Jing, and Zhang Fei was assassinated by two of his subordinates. This powerful portrait shows him during the Battle of Changban in 208, standing on the bridge, shaking his lance, and daring the opposing forces to attack him.",
