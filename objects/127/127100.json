  "text": "Painter Joseph Mbatia Bertiers has been called “the Master of African Satire.” Here he has filled his chaotic canvas with entertaining details, depicting his contemporaries with humor and irreverence—and a touch of malice. Amid countless normal folks trying to go about their daily business in the capital city of Nairobi, Kenya, the artist has scattered international celebrities and world leaders who blend into the crowd. Look closely to find Russian president Vladimir Putin, former British prime minister David Cameron, and former U.S. presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton.",
