  "text": "Dial Cross is a hybrid image in which the artist combined the human body and machines. They combine at the top into an unusual construction that is mechanical and organic, about to perform a mysterious function with the aid of the long lever that leads down to the lower right corner of the canvas. Hagedorn was a German émigré to the U.S. who settled initially in the Twin Cities where he taught, exhibited, and took commissions for stained glass.",
