  "text": "In this fiery scene, “Odai Matarokurō” stands upright, as rigid as a statue, while dense flames engulf him from behind. His enemies fall backward as if pushed by the wind feeding the fire; others run away in fear. Although the rectangular cartouche at the upper right identifies the burning man as “Odai Matarokurō, ” he might in fact be Oda Nobunao, the husband of Oda Nobunaga’s sister. Yoshitoshi often used pseudonyms to circumvent government censorship; his depiction of certain historical figures and events could have been construed as supporting opponents of the Tokugawa ruler.",
