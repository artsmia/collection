  "text": "Yoshitoshi lived during a time of drastic and disruptive social change and is considered the last major ukiyo-e artist. He was born into a merchant family and became a student of Utagawa Kuniyoshi in the early 1850s. His earliest published print dates from 1853. Initially he designed images of beautiful women and actors in the Utagawa school style, but then shifted to a more realistic type of depiction. In 1858, he became an independent artist and focused on historical subjects. He gained a reputation as a \"war artist\" through his depictions of violence. After recovering from a serious nervous disorder in 1873, he started to illustrate newspapers. In the 1880s, he was much sought after and produced many great and important series, but illustrated also a number of books and was active as a painter.",
