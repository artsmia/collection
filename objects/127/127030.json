  "text": "Léon Augustin Lhermitte’s sympathetic, realistic portrayal of the people of rural France—their customs and hard work—played well to Parisian audiences at the annual Salon exhibitions, and even gained the admiration of Vincent van Gogh. A prolific artist, Lhermitte executed thousands of paintings, pastels, and charcoal drawings. This superb head study is representative of the artist’s mature style and reflects his commitment to naturalism both in terms of the drawing’s acutely-observed handling as well as his preference for humble subjects. The sitter, an aging woman with shaggy hair and a simple veil and shawl, becomes, in Lhermitte’s hand, an image of enduring strength and grace. Depicting her in a quiet moment of contemplation, with eyes turned solemnly upward, Lhermitte sensitively captures her aging features, weary spirit, and resilience to create an exceptionally lifelike and compelling portrait.",
