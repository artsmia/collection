  "text": "Léon Augustin Lhermitte’s sympathetic, realistic portrayal of the people of rural France played well to Parisian audiences and even gained the admiration of the Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh (1853–1890). This drawing reflects Lhermitte’s commitment to naturalism both in its acutely observed handling and its humble subject. The sitter, an aging woman with a simple veil and shawl, becomes, in Lhermitte’s hand, an image of strength and grace.",
