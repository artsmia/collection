  "text": "This image is nearly identical to the nearby triptych. The three-panel print must have been a great success because Yoshitoshi was commissioned by another publisher to create an almost identical version as a fan print five years later. The survival rate of fan prints is considerably lower than other formats, because they were intended to be cut out and glued onto the ribs of fans. This was the case with this print as well, and if you look closely you can see faint lines that indicate its intended purpose.",
