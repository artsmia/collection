  "text": "The northern Thai kilns at Kalong were first discovered in 1933, yielding evidence of some 200 kilns producing high-fired porcelain wares for domestic consumption between the 14th-16th centuries, during the height of the La Na kingdom. Situated in a valley east of the Mae Lo River, the potters at Kalong made use of a clay with a high percentage of kaolin to create thinly potted, elegant ceramics characterized by a chalky, buff body, and a faint, ‘rain cloud grey’ glaze. Within the broader tradition of Thai ceramics, Kalong wares are noteworthy for their painterly underglaze designs which evocatively conjure the natural world. Here, the bulbous body of the vase features a fish darting in a sea of water plants.",
