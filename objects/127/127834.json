  "text": "A young man glares at his unseen enemies from behind a bamboo shield. The blue-patterned cartouche at the top right identifies him as Sakuma Dennai, a foot soldier who fought during the Siege of Osaka (1614–15). While the print references past events, the figure depicted here was likely based on members of the Shōgitai, a group of warriors who fought for the failing shogunate.\r\nYoshitoshi sketched the preparatory drawing of the Dennai print on one side of a thin sheet of paper. On the other side he sketched the bowed head of a man. As a result, the two appear to be intertwined in the drawing.",
