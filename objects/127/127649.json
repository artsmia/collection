  "text": "This is the actual face imprint of the makeup worn by the actor Hanayagi Jusuke II (1893-1970) for the role of the Lion Spirit in a performance of the play The Lion Dance (Kagamijishi 鏡獅子) that was staged in the 1960s. Such a face imprint, or oshiguma, is a unique memento that is not always done after a performance, but if so then there is just one per performance. In this case, after Jusuke II pressed his face on a piece of cloth and the makeup has been transferred, the actor added a poem and also his autograph.",
