  "text": "This work continues Ohtake Shinro’s practice of using collage to create forms that project off the canvas to occupy three-dimensional space, like a sculpture. Ohtake’s crusty collection of materials is full of tears, punctures, and other flaws, mimicking the messy, imperfect nature of memory. Layers of paper scraps create cracks and fault lines, suggesting that memory resembles Earth’s tectonic plates, whose shifting and sliding causes earthquakes and volcanoes. Lines drawn in with ballpoint pen may refer to the uneven flow of time.",
