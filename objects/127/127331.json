  "text": "This imposing gate once formed the entrance to the main courtyard of an urban middle-class family compound. The four-character panel over the doorway reads Humility Brings Prosperity (Luqian jianfeng 履謙漸豐). The gate demonstrates the hallmarks of traditional Chinese architecture: a post-and-lintel structure that supports a graceful gable roof and intricate rafters and brackets that extend the eaves and provide decoration. Like other works of traditional Chinese architecture, it was originally assembled using only joinery and wooden pins, without any glue or nails. The gate comes from Shanxi province, which, because of its dry climate, contains the largest concentration of surviving historic wooden structures in China. An inscription on a once-adjoining building dates the gate to 1858.\r\n",
