  "text": "Anishinaabe artist Jim Denomie depicts Plains Indians on horseback staring directly at the viewer, a gentle tease to 19th century Native American portraiture found in Western American art. The Delegation contains Denomie’s characteristic style of loose brush strokes and distilled animate figures, yet uses creamy and light pastel colors rather than his traditional bold hues.",
