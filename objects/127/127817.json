  "text": "This print is part of a series of eight triptychs that was produced from 1867 to 1868 showcasing famous warrior stories. Each story is juxtaposed to the theme of the Eight Views, a concept derived from the popular subject of Chinese landscape paintings of the Eight Views of the Confluence of the Xiao and Xiang rivers (Shōshō hakkei). One of these views praises the autumn moon, which has been integrated here in the upper left. Another artist, Katsukawa Shuntei III, provided the background for this print.",
