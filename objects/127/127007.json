  "text": "Processions are a recurring motif in William Kentridge’s work, which typically critiques the injustices and follies of modern society. In Eight Figures, each character in the procession wears or carries an attribute symbolizing its personal identity and social role. Among them are a miner, farmer, medical professional, architect, and porters, who move left to right along a narrow wooden ramp or boardwalk. The scene takes place in an indeterminate interior bathed in artificial electric light. The background is also ambiguous, punctuated with vaguely outlined figures, floating numbers, and vertical lines segmenting the space. Words in English and Russian run along the edge of the ramp like advertisements and text fragments appear elsewhere in the composition. Porters appear regularly in Kentridge’s work, often hauling the symbolic burden of “white guilt” over the immorality and persistent consequences of apartheid. These and the other non-heroic figures signal a larger, perhaps endless procession of people trudging ever forward through daily life, their multi-faceted identities shaped by political, social, and personal forces. For Kentridge, the procession is a metaphor for society’s collective journey, a nomadic passage through life, but one that requires critique and self-evaluation. Though hopeful in its outlook, it is also a satirical commentary on the brutality, ignorance, and hypocrisy of modern life.",
