  "text": "The 17th century has been called the Golden Age of the Dutch Republic, its prosperity built by a new and expanding merchant class which had become wealthy through industry and international trade, its tolerance of religious and intellectual diversity, and its patronage of home grown and international traders, craftsmen and artists. This radiance was in large part supported by the Dutch mastery of fishing for herring and by preserving this otherwise undistinguished silver fish. So much of the national wealth was accumulated through this industry that Amsterdam was said to have been built on herring bones. What could be a more appropriate subject to be celebrated by the potteries in Delft'",
