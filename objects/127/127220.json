  "text": "This series of twelve plates is painted with scenes related to fishing for herring. While undistinguished in appearance, this silver fish was an abundant source of food in the North Sea and supported a vast fishing industry in the Netherlands. Herring fishing accounted for such a large percentage of the wealth of the Dutch Republic that Amsterdam was said to have been built on herring bones.",
