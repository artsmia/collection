  "text": "Today Sennen Cove, at the southwestern tip of England, is popular with surfers. But in the early 1920s it was filled with boats, and the black roundhouse contained a winch for pulling them onto shore. (Today this building contains souvenirs, and the cottage with a thatch roof is a vacation rental.) John Platt used a separate block for each of the seven colors in this exquisite bird’s-eye view. He purposely chose a plank with curved grain to print the rounded green coastline, then further enhanced the curves with the direction of his brushstrokes while inking the printing block.",
