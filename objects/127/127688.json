  "text": "African shields, while primarily functional objects used in warfare, also played a role as dance regalia during funerals and initiations, and served as status objects and symbols of identification. Because they were often made for ostentatious display, their appearance—size, decoration, color, and materials—was of vital importance. As such, shields can be appreciated as sculptural expressions of creativity and craftsmanship, blurring the line between utilitarian skill and fine art.",
