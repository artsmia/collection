  "text": "This photograph portrays a wild pony found in an animal sanctuary in Cape Toino in Miyazaki, Southern Japan. Considered to be one of Kono’s masterworks, it demonstrates his transition from pictorialism (where a photograph was made unique and painting-like through various complex darkroom techniques, including toning, and often by printing on various types of paper, like Japanese rice paper) to experimental realism. The picture is matte, flat, and dark, revealing delicate shades of grey and black, and hinting at its pictorial roots, while it unveils piercing eyes of the pony in darkness.",
