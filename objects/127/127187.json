  "text": "Street children are a global phenomenon and a painful reminder of how our societies (don’t) deal with their most vulnerable members. The Ivoirian painter Armand Boua uses collage and scrubbing techniques to create deteriorated surfaces that deliberately unsettle the image, reflecting the precarious conditions of his subjects—the children who live on the streets of his hometown of Abidjan. This painting is part of a series on children who live on the street: “I wanted to show their suffering, their way of life,” Boua has said, “so that people are finally aware of this painful reality they pretend not to see.”",
