  "text": "We might call this drawing a “noble wreck.” Drawn with lively assurance, it is also now sadly damaged. The scene is the Annunciation, a story from the New Testament book of Luke in which the angel Gabriel announces to the Virgin Mary that with the coming of the Holy Spirit she will conceive and give birth to the child of God, Jesus, who will rule the descendants of Jacob forever. We do not know who made this remarkable drawing. It was formerly attributed to the Milanese artist Bernardino Lanino, but Carmen Bambach recently suggested it more likely came from Bologna, drawn by an artist in the circle of the accomplished Mannerist painter Orazio Samacchini. Whoever it was beautifully captured the drama of the miraculous event. Gabriel seems to glide down from heaven as his hair and clothing flutter in gusts of wind. He bends slightly to help alleviate Mary’s apparent fear, and he points upward to indicate the source of his astounding news.",
