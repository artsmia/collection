  "text": "Morimura explores in this series of self-portraits the idea of the self as subject and object. Known for his later and better-known self-portraits in which he presents himself as of famous artists and celebrities, these earlier works speak to Morimura’s longstanding fascination with the visual language used to reveal and conceal the self in performance and portraiture. The artist seen here in these portraits stands on a small stage, places himself in the backdrop of a scene, then poses dramatically in the foreground of another. The theatrical staging of these works in Morimura’s small studio and home explores the artist’s sense of identity and the performance such an identity demands in an increasingly globalized Japan.",
