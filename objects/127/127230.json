  "text": "The artist chose light blue paper to suggest a night-scene. Participants form a half-circle, and some are dancing in the center to the beat of a female drummer. This is the traditional dhaanto dance-song, which mimics the movements of a camel. The dance is typical of nomadic Somali communities in rural areas.",
