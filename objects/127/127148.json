  "text": "Self-taught artist Henry Ray Clark developed the creative persona of an extraterrestrial with fantastic powers. Clark’s belief was sincere: “I know they are out there, ” he said, “because I have been there. Every night when I go to bed, I travel in my spaceship going to all of the places I put on these papers.” Clark was convicted of a crime and spent years in the Texas prison system, where he turned to drawing as a psychological release from extended periods of confinement and isolation. This ink and crayon diptych exemplifies Clark’s fascination with richly detailed pattern and line. Clark said, “They can lock my body up, but they can't lock up my mind. As long as my mind can create something beautiful to look at I am a free man and I will live forever in my art.” The interpretation and meaning of the two abstract compositions is elusive and is left to the viewer.",
