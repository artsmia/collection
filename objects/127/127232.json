  "text": "Men and women move around in the green countryside, among tress and livestock, camels and cows. Camels are an essential part of life for many Somalis who are nomadic pastoralists, a fact reflected in Somali language. There are no less that forty-six Somali words for camel, from “best camel in the herd” (mandhoorey) and “unloaded pack-camel” (caddaysimo), to “milk-producing camel that is partially milked” (xagjir) and “docile pack-camel that can be loaded with delicate items” (gurgurshaa). While herders are typically men, the artist has added two women to enliven the scene.",
