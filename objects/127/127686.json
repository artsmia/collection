  "text": "This unusual and striking seven-sheet composition by the Osaka print-designer Yoshitaki depicts a fictional array of actors from The Tale of Shiranui (Shiranui monogatari), a bestselling serial novel that was published from 1849 until1885. The story is a revenge tale of a samurai woman facing the downfall of her family. Several kabuki adaptations were developed, but this composition is not related to an actual performance. At its center is the beautiful Princess Wakana, who is in reality an earth spider, here unveiled as she is sitting on one. Her web spreads over all seven sheets behind six warriors ready to fight her.",
