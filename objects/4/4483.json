  "text": "The French painter Rosa Bonheur specialized in pictures of animals, which were celebrated for their vivacity and realism. She achieved international fame and became the first woman admitted to the French Legion of Honor in 1865. She was also openly gay, making her path to success in a male-dominated profession that much more groundbreaking.\r\n\r\nThis was reportedly her personal painting palette for decades. When she completed a celebrated picture in 1855, her godson asked if he could have it. She quickly painted a deer in the forest on the palette's surface for him.",
