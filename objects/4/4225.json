  "text": "This bronze conch shell would have been blown at the beginning of a tantric ritual, making the sound of the principle mantra, \"om.\" A practitioner repeats the mantra numerous times in order to gain clarity and focus in meditation. The conch's sound would have assisted the pracitioner in overcoming their personal fears and delusions.  An image of a dancing multi-headed Hevajra with two kneeling celestial attendants appears on the base of the mouth. The conch is supported on a tripod with snake-shaped feet, and would have been displayed vertically during ceremonies.",
