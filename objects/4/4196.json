  "text": "Harry Jackson left his hometown of Chicago at age fourteen to become a ranch hand in Wyoming. At eighteen he enlisted in the Marines and used his artistic skill to document the horrors of World War II. The effect of both experiences can be felt in Stampede. Jackson’s youthful fascination with the American West takes a dark turn, with young cowboys caught up and entangled in the rush of stampeding cattle. The sculpture carries a sense of urgency and danger he would have known in war.",
