  "text": "Warren MacKenzie is arguably the most prominent contemporary ceramics artist.  After studying ceramics at the university level, he traveled to the UK to study at Leach Pottery under the direction of British potter Bernard Leach.  In 1952 MacKenzie and his wife Alix moved to Minnesota, where he remains today.  He is a professor emeritus at the University of Minnesota and maintains a studio in Stillwater.\r\n\r\nThroughout his studies in ceramics MacKenzie was continually impressed by the oriental aesthetic of Japanese ceramics artists such as Kanjiro Kawai and Shoji Hamada.  Called <I>mingei</I>, this Japanese folk craft tradition began in the 1920s and 1930s and is defined by handmade objects intended to be functional in daily life and that keep the maker's identity anonymous.  The mark of the hand is quite literal in this plate, where the outline of MacKenzie's fingers can be seen as he dipped the plate in glaze.",
