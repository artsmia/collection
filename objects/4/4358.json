  "text": "This photograph is one of Palma’s earliest pieces and showcases his commitment to the indigenous culture of Guatemala. The subject wears a virgin’s crown, a symbol of holy worship, while staring directly at the camera. Dark and dripping pigment at the bottom of the picture contrasts with her celestial crown, perhaps referencing blood and sacrifice and alluding to the mistreatment of Guatemala’s native population.",
