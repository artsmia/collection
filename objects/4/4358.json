  "text": "Amerika is one of Luis González Palma’s earliest pieces and was made only six years after he took up photography. This photograph showcases his commitment to the indigenous culture of Guatemala by representing an indigenous woman in a traditional headdress, and helped propel him into international recognition in the early 1990s.\r\nThe subject wears a virgin’s crown, a symbol of holy worship, while staring directly at the camera. Dark and dripping pigment at the bottom of the picture contrasts with her celestial crown, perhaps referencing blood and crucifixion and alluding to the mistreatment of Guatemala’s native population, as the artist has intended.",
