  "text": "Lyrical and jewel-like in their expressive color, Morrison’s “Horizon” paintings are essentially reveries on the intrinsic natural beauty and changing moods of the shoreline of Lake Superior. Morrison believed that nature, particularly the sky and water, held a spiritual vitality, a transcendent force that could be experienced and captured through an aesthetic rooted in observation, intuition, and abstraction",
