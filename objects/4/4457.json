  "text": "A mandala is a visual representation of the sacred Buddhist universe, which is used in meditation and initiation rites. The creation of a mandala is believed to benefit all beings, and the time and space it requires is consecrated through prayer, ritual music, and performance.\r\n\r\nA team of monks-in residence created this colored sand mandala at the museum in 1991 over a period of four weeks. While sand mandalas are intended to be ephemeral, the MIA preserved it in order to honor the 1.2 million Tibetans who lost their lives to political-religious persecution during the 20th century.\r\n\r\nThe museum thanks the Tibetan American Foundation of Minnesota for bringing the Gyuto monks to Minnesota and for their efforts to preserve Tibetan cultural traditions.",
