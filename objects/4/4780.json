  "text": "Donald Judd once claimed that “art need only be interesting.” As part of the Minimalist movement of the 1960s and ’70s, Judd used prefabricated materials in multiple variations to create works that were radically pared-down icons of geometric clarity. In the 1960s, Judd outsourced his cantilevered wall pieces, such as Untitled, to the Bernstein Brothers fabrication shop in Queens, New York. Following the artist’s formula, they bent, shaped, and polished the copper with machine‑crafted precision, creating a beautiful, mathematically proportioned object.\r\nThe resulting works reflect a collaborative process, bridging the vision of a singular artist and the expertise of the skilled tradespeople who materialized his ideas.",
