  "text": "Ironically, neither type of jade, nephrite nor jadeite, is indigenous to central China. All these precious materials had to be transported great distances from Chinese Turkestan in the extreme west or, in the case of jadeite, from northern Burma. This undoubtedly greatly enhanced the value and mystique with which the Chinese have always imbued this natural substance. The boulder shown here is typical of the type of raw jade, indistinguishable from most other rocks, found in the riverbed regions of Turkestan. The outer rinds of the stone has been ground away to reveal the color of the mineral beneath. It was thus prepared to be auctioned off to representatives of the jade-carving workshops, who bid according to the color, size and granular consistency of each piece.",
