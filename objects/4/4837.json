  "text": "Following the outbreak of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in 1966, nearly all artist creation except for propaganda work ceased for nearly a decade. Increasingly, however, during the late 1970's and 80's, artists were given greater latitude and traditional ink painting inspired by major pre-revolutionary figures such as Qi Baishi reemerged as a legitimate art form.\r\nThe painter of this large panoramic landscape, Hsieh Chih-liu, is of this later generation of artists who have helped resurrect the ink landscape theme with the use of traditional materials and techniques. A tiny, solitary scholar poised on a bridge near the center of the composition stands overwhelmed by mountains that suggest a Sung landscape in their monumentality. The light-colored washes derive from Ming literati models while the composition and brushwork are more contemporary.",
