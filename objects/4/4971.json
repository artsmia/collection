  "text": "This exceptionally refined work is the only freestanding hardwood towel rack known to exist. The top rail is decorated at each end with ling-chih motifs, the fungus of immortality. Both sides of the central panel feature exquisitely carved scenes of mandarin ducks in lotus ponds. The presence of these ducks, which mate for life, suggests a wish for a long, happy marital union, and it is likely that this towel rack was originally part of a bride's dowry. Sets of bedroom furniture including towel racks, wash basin stands, storage trunks, dressing tables, mirror stands, as well as canopy beds were standard dowry items.",
