  "text": "This exceptionally refined work is the only freestanding hardwood towel rack known to exist. The top rail is decorated at each end with <I>ling-chih</I> motifs, the fungus of immortality. Both sides of the central panel feature exquisitely carved scenes of mandarin ducks in lotus ponds. The presence of these ducks, which mate for life, suggests a wish for a long, happy marital union, and it is likely that this towel rack was originally part of a bride's dowry. Sets of bedroom furniture including towel racks, wash basin stands, storage trunks, dressing tables, mirror stands, as well as canopy beds were standard dowry items.",
