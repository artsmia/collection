  "text": "Jaromir Funke studied both medicine and law but found that his passion lay in photography. He began his career by taking photographs of his hometown, Kolín, in what is now the Czech Republic. Later he became influenced by Cubism, a style in which an object is shown from multiple points of view in one picture, resulting in images that appear fragmented or abstracted. Uniting the avant-garde with representational art and industrial materials, Funke’s photographic work developed a focus on abstract compositions of objects he assembled. In his Compositions, Funke experimented with how forms manipulate light within a space. Here, he is playing with how the shadows cast on paper by the translucent glass sheets interact with the reflection and shadows of the ball situated between them.",
