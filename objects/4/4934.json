  "text": "The Dutch East India company sent designs by Cornelius Pronk to Japan as well as China to be copied onto porcelain.  Japanese painters were paid more than their Chinese counterparts, which led the the Dutch to cancel the order. However, several plates using the lady with a parasol design, including the one shown here, were produced on a purely private basis.",
