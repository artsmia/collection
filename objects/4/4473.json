  "text": "“One gets lost in this chaotic and luminous universe in search for a pathway, a window to an unexpected personal experience.” – Beatrice Helg\r\nBeatrice Helg’s Labyrinthe is a complex image in which stairs, steps and ladder are blending into a multitude of geometrical forms. Dramatic lighting and layers of glass lead the viewer into a mysterious, labyrinthian space. It is unclear, however, where the path will lead.\r\nCreated in Helg’s studio in 1991, the photograph was the starting point for a new body of work around the theme of stair. Helg elaborates on the meaning: “A stair is not simply a beautiful and forceful architectural element, in my constructions it becomes a metaphor and invites the viewer to a spiritual walk.”",
