  "text": "Factory Workers grew from a Fortune magazine assignment to help illustrate “The Negro’s War,” an article in the June 1942 issue. Consistent with the tone of the feature, which examined racial discrimination during wartime and advocated for full integration of the American workplace, Romare Bearden’s drawing is a somber, dignified portrayal of African Americans who have been denied work at a steel mill because of their skin color. Although representational, the work confirms Bearden’s rejection of academic naturalism while signaling his growing admiration for Mexican mural painters.",
