  "text": "Monumental twelve-panel screens became fashionable during the Kangxi reign (1662–1722), when they served as backdrops for formal gatherings. Each of the hinged panels framed a painting or calligraphy. In this example, the panoramic scene depicts a son’s capping ceremony, his official graduation to adulthood, in the landscaped garden of an aristocratic villa. The painting combines figures with scenery and architecture. The realism and quality of detail in the painting is remarkable. There is a good deal of valuable information about architecture, costume, and accoutrements of the inner quarters. The open carving is finely finished on both sides, a rarity on large screens. Each of the upper and lower wood panels displays hornless dragons surrounding a medallion with stylized <I>shou</I> (longevity) characters.",
