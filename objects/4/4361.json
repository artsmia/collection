  "text": "The Yoruba have one of the highest proportion of twins of any ethnic group.  If a twin passes away, an Ibeji is commissioned to honor his or her spirit and help the family deal with their loss. These figures are ritually cared for, dressed and fed by the child's mother throughout her lifetime. This responsibility may be passed on to other female relatives after her death so that an Ibeji could be cared for through several generations.  Each city-state and major area of Yoruba culture has developed its own style variant of these elegantly carved figures.",
