Their reference is not the Christian cross but rather the star symbol traditional used in Plains art.  \r\nIn this contemporary example of the metalsmith's art, a finely engraved eagle is the central symbol, flanked by four sets of geometric designs, heart-shaped cutouts, and circular pendants.\r\n",
