  "text": "Large crosses of German (nickel) silver were frequently worn as chest ornaments by men of the southern and central Plains.  Their reference is not the Christian cross but rather the star symbol traditional used in Plains art.  \r\nIn this contemporary example of the metalsmith's art, a finely engraved eagle is the central symbol, flanked by four sets of geometric designs, heart-shaped cutouts, and circular pendants.",
