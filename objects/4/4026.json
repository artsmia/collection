  "text": "Harry Bertoia, a trained sculptor, thought of his few furniture designs as “studies in space, form, and metal.” He left the wire construction exposed in the original “Diamond” armchair, but manufacturer Knoll quickly made concessions to consumers who wanted more comfort, with seat cushions and covers like the one seen here. The chair’s upholstery is typical of vintage Knoll furniture, featuring brightly colored, manmade materials.",
