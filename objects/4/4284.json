  "text": "Born in Ferrara, Crema studied in Naples and Bologna before moving to Rome in 1903. Much of his earliest work was concerned with socio-humanistic issues. This triptych, however, with its references to an unidentified legend, stems from a phase when the artist's fascination with mythology coincided with an adherence to the color theories of neo-impressionism.",
