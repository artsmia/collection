  "text": "Behrens trained as a graphic designer before pursuing architecture and interior design—you can see his graphic sensibilities in the bold and simple lines of this chair. A single color highlights its sculptural nature. Delicate tapering legs, undulating curves, and overlapping elements make up this chair’s legs and back. The square recessed portion of the chair back near the seat is echoed in the cut-out space at the top crest rail.",
