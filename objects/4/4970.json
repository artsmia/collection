  "text": "The traditional Chinese house had no closets, but the Chinese clothes rack served as a temporary closet, allowing several layers of clothing to be shed or put back on with convenience. It also functioned as a way of displaying fashionable pieces of clothing. While a clothes rack was a common piece of furniture in the sleeping quarters of both men and women, only a few hardwood examples have survived. In spite of several old repairs, this stand has retained its extremely simple design. The top rail is decorated at each end with the ling-chih fungus of immortality and the central panel is comprised of the so-called \"cracked ice pattern.\"",
