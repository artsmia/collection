  "text": "This large storage vessel was found in a cave in the Kalong district of northern Thailand in 1990. There were 17 vessels in the find, including eight large, expertly made glazed jars with finely stamped patterns like this one. Similar vessels have been excavated at Buddhist stupas (reliquary mounds); the exact function of this one, found in a very different context, remains a mystery.",
