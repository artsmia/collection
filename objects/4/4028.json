  "text": "The edgy visual imagery and powerful impact of Mary Bero's work is all the more surprising when one realizes its diminutive size and the intricacy of the embroidery media she employs.   \r\n\r\nArtists who reached artistic maturity in the later part of the 20th century were less pressured by the need to produce physically large works in order to receive recognition. Multi-media objects had greater acceptance and, of even greater importance, the point made by many of the artists represented in this exhibit that meaningful visual messages depend on aesthetic sensibility not size.",
