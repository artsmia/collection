  "text": "Serge Nekrassoff excelled at working copper into spiraling shapes. This decorative bowl recalls a large flower, with flowing petals and a center hammered to look like the stamen of a daisy. He has also created a sense of movement in the candlesticks, with their twisting stems. If you look into the bowl or candlestick drip cups closely, you can see where Nekrassoff skillfully gave motion to these stationary objects—making solid copper look like water swirling down a drain.",
