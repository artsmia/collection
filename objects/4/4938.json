  "text": "From the 1730s to the mid 1800s, Sweden's East India Company regularly left Gothenburg bound for Canton where, after nearly a year at sea, they purchased silks, tea, spices, and porcelain.  Wealthy Swedish consumers were among the first in Europe to order porcelain customized with coats of arms, portraits, or Scandinavian landscapes.  Sources for these decorations were sent to China in the forms of drawings, prints, bookplates.  \r\n\r\nAn actual bank note was most likely the source for the interior decoration of this bowl.  The bank note is dated 1762, when Sweden faced economic upheaval due to its participation in the Seven Years War.",
