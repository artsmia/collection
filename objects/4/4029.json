  "text": "With regal assurance, the Hindu god Vishnu stands in the posture of perfect balance, atop a lotus and at the center of the universe. Vishnu is honored as the lord of preservation, and with his club and discus, maintains order over the totality of space and time. Here, he is flanked by the goddesses Laxmi, who signifies wealth, and Sarastavi, who plays a string instrument and embodies knowledge. These attributes garnered the deity great patronage among many ruling dynasties, as well as many households today. Here, Vishnu is shown with numerous attendants in a heavenly home. Roundels at the top of the sculpture depict his 10 earthly incarnations, which include popular personalities such as Rama and Krishna, who came to earth in times of trouble and vanquished it from evil.",
