  "text": "Silk pieced and embroidered quilts, frequently called \"crazy quilts\" because of the irregular shape of the individual units, were popular at the turn of this century. This quilt particularly relates to Minneapolis because it incorporates many printed ribbons. They range from announcements of Hennepin Avenue printers Moffett and Thurston, sponsors of the Minneapolis Harvest Festival on September 23, 1893, to a memorial ribbon honoring Levi Butler of the Minneapolis Woman's Relief Corps, No. 3.",
