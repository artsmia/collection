  "text": "Small jade vessels carved like ancient ritual vessels were favorite objects in the scholar's study. The Gui and liting forms shown here were the most commonly imitated shapes during the Ming dynasty. These small bowls may have served as incense burners or water holders for the scholar's table. Their archaic shapes and decoration reflect the literati's interest in collecting and studying ancient Chinese art and literature.",
