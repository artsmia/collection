  "text": "Interaction between object and viewer is a defining element of much of Sherrie Smith's work. Using common industrial cotton bands that have been carefully pre-dyed to interact in very specific ways with a three element plaited structure, the artist has created a three-dimensional surface with geometric imagery that changes as the viewer moves.\r\n\r\nSurprise, and the desire to expand the viewers' imagination into the realm of infinite possibilities, are some of the motivating forces that have inspired fiber artists. The use of materials and structures in non-traditional and unexpected ways as well as aesthetic choices all play a vital role in the innovative twentieth century Fiber Art Movement.",
