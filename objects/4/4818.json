  "text": "Although widely used by both genders, the so-called rose chair because of its small size and evocative name has traditionally been associated with women and the women's quarters. Comprised of slender sections of huanghuali, this petite armchair evokes a delicacy that does in fact have feminine overtones.\r\n\r\n<P>The latticework designs filling the back and arm sections are comprised of addorsed and linked <I>ruyi</I> heads (the wish granting scepter) and cloud scrolls. Carved <I>lingzhi</I> fungus (the fungus of immortality) comprise the wooden struts between the stretchers and seat rails. The metal reinforcing mounts, required to reinforce several of the chair's delicate joints are original.",
