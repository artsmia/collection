  "text": "This collage addresses the post-reservation period of 1880 to 1940. Lakota communities of that time were in extreme flux. Their traditions and lifestyle were severely disrupted by U.S. government policies that forced them to relocate, convert to Christianity, and attend boarding schools.\r\n\r\nAmiotte examines a Lakota tradition of generosity known as the Giveaway. To honor their son or daughter, parents give away many valuable things—horses, blankets, trade items, lavishly beaded clothing, and food—to exhibit their generosity. Amiotte reveals the importance of trade items, including a man’s new suit, in the context of reservation life. The ledger paper at the left represents the financial costs now associated with this tradition, as seen through the lens of Euro-American capitalism.",
