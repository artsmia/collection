  "text": "The anonymous artist of the Handicraft Guild—likely a woman—used bold form and visible hammer marks to emphasize material and process when creating this spoon. The guild, an egalitarian organization housed in its own building in downtown Minneapolis, provided design and craft training and instruction. Most objects made by its members were marked only with “HG.” This spoon would have been sold in the guild shop alongside handmade metalwork, ceramics, leather, jewelry, and hand-bound books.",
