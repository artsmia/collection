  "text": "Frank Paul Vigil’s loving portrait of a horse shows honor and respect to the animal. Wild horses are populous in the Southwest where Vigil grew up. The bond between people and horses in this community is critical and sacred. That reverence is evident in Vigil’s work through the low vantage point from which he depicted the stallion, the proud expression he captures, and the strong but elegant movement in the animal’s pose.",
