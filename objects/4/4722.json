  "text": "Roundback armchairs were developed during the Tang (618-906) and Song (960-1279) dynasties to become one of the classic chair types of the Ming period. Constructed from substantial timbers, with solid C-curved backsplats and brass protectors on the footrails, this pair relates closely with four other known examples which are probably from the same set. Roundback chairs, like yokeback armchairs, were generally reserved for use by the higher ranking members of a Chinese family and by greater Chinese society. Chairs like these were typically used on formal occasions in symmetrical arrangements.",
