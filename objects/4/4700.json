The front two legs divide into three pieces, one rising to the center front, one to front corner and the third rises to the join of the seat and back leg and then continues visually, curving slightly upward to the top of the back of the chair. The leather upholstery is tooled in a motif of interlacing flowing ribbons. A separate piece of tooled leather covers the join of the seat and the wooden frame.",
