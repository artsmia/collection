The front two legs divide into three pieces, one rising to the center front, one to front corner and the third rises to the join of the seat and back leg and then continues visually, curving slightly upward to the top of the back of the chair. The leather upholstery is tooled in a motif of interlacing flowing ribbons. A separate piece of tooled leather covers the join of the seat and the wooden frame.",

  "text": "This side chair was originally part of a complete dining room suite acquired in 1900 from Samuel Bing's \"L'Art Nouveau\" shop in Paris by Mr. and Mrs. Knut Andersson, a Swedish couple on their honeymoon. For the great Paris Exposition Universelle of 1900, Bing concentrated exclusively on the work of French designers, presenting a pavilion with rooms decorated to resemble a luxuriously appointed modern interior. The chair's curvaceous form and undulating whiplash motif (seen in the hand-tooled leather) are the hallmarks of French Art Nouveau.",
