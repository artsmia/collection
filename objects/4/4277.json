  "text": "In 1962, Andy Warhol enlisted Edward Wallowitch, a commercial photographer and occasional assistant in the Factory (Warhol’s New York studio) in a project to shoot still-life images of everyday objects—Campbell’s soup cans, U.S. bills, and so on. Warhol relied on these photographs as source material for a series of drawings. He likely used an opaque projector to enlarge the original images so he could trace their forms on paper. He added shading, texture, and other details freehand.\r\n\r\nThe finished drawings blend fidelity to the photographic still lifes with Warhol’s personalized interventions. He transformed his subject and its utter ordinariness by altering its scale, presenting an unusual configuration (in this case the faceted landscape of crumpled paper), and using gestural drawing techniques. Even if the dollar bill is readily recognized, the image is seen in a new light—a distinctive, aesthetically pleasing work of art surprising in its power to provoke contemplation.",
