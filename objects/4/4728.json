  "text": "The interior of this exceptionally large and well-preserved Kashan dish is decorated with an elegant Arabic verse: La elah ela allah (No god other than god). During the Seljuk period, innovative Kashan workshops produced a variety of luster, underglaze-decorated, and monochrome wares. Chemical changes in the glaze resulting from centuries of burial gave this striking work a heavy iridescence.",
