  "text": "Granet first painted this subject in 1812, not long after the atheist Napoleon had suppressed Rome's monasteries and restricted the wearing of clerical dress. Since the living monks were forbidden to wear their habits, Granet used skeletons of dead Capuchin monks as models. He sketched them in the church's burial crypt - wearing their habits and with perfectly preserved beards. \r\n\r\nTo convey the monks' spirituality and give the image a sacred aura, Granet depicted the chapel enveloped in dark shadows and illuminated by heavenly light. He included himself as an onlooker, sketchbook in hand, in the lower right corner. A practicing Catholic, he was saddened to see the churches half empty and Rome's religious splendor dimmed. \r\n\r\nThe most prominent painter of architectural interiors in 19th-century France, Granet rendered his subjects with great precision and emphasized effects of light and perspective. This work is one of several later versions of the 1812 painting.",
