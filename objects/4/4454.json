  "text": "This warrior figure, probably representing Kuan yu, the Chinese god of war, once belonged to the American architect, Frank Lloyd Wright. As early as 1925, photos of the dining area of his living room at Taliesin North show this figurine on view, carefully displayed on a shelf above the built-in Japanese screen on the north wall of this famous room.\r\n\r\nA favorite Asian object of Mr. Wright's, the work was still on view in the late 1950's when clients recall the architect once taking the ceramic down from the shelf, during a conversation and stroking it as one might stroke a family cat.\r\n\r\nIn China, these ceramics were mounted along the roof ridges of important buildings, where they were thought to protect from the entire structure from evil.",
