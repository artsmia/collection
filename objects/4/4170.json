  "text": "\"I am interested in investigating...ways to create textiles which are not only aesthetically pleasing because of design and color, but also contain elements of tactile and visual surprise, pleasure, excitement.\"  -- Claire Zeisler\r\n\r\nTrained as a painter and sculptor, Claire Zeisler became interested in woven structures in the 1950s. She created sculpture from a variety of fibers--jute, sisal, raffia, silk, wool--and in the mid-1970s began working with leather. Leather did not require weaving, knotting, or joining but could instead be cut and folded. This piece consists of a freestanding metal armature supporting hundreds of strips of cut leather that cascade in a shifting series of red and gray planes.",
