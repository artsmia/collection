  "text": "When boys are initiated into the Pokot social hierarchy, their headrests are adorned with decorations to commemorate this rite of passage. Headrests in Pokot society, like in many other African cultures, denote one's place in a community by showing status and role.  Since the Pokot are nomadic pastoralists who also value elaborate coiffures, they need small, portable headrests to protect their hair.  This is one of the few regions where headrests are still used today.",
