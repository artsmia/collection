  "text": "We can now put a name to this face. For centuries, this painting was known simply as Portrait of a Woman. Recent research revealed her identity: Lucia Wijbrants, the wealthy widow of a Dutch cloth merchant. She stands at her dressing table, surrounded by her pricey possessions, while a frisky spaniel begs for attention. Lucia emerged from a variety of sources, including known portraits (of her and her husband) featuring similar likenesses and some of the same belongings pictured here. In fact, the bed behind her was previously owned by her husband’s first wife.",
