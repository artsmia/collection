  "text": "Plains artists used a variety of methods to record their activities, drawing or painting scenes as visual tools to tell their stories. <P>In this drawing Old Bull depicts three episodes from a horse raiding expedition against the Apsaalooka (Crow). The story begins in the lower right corner, showing the artist and his comrades, in their cold-weather clothing of wool leggings and hooded coats, leading a group of horses away from an Apsaalooka village. A battle ensues, forcing Old Bull and his men to take defense behind large boulders, shown in the middle of the drawing. The final scene was drawn in the upper right corner where Old Bull has loaded a wounded young man on a travois.<P>The labeling and lines that separate the different scenes were probably added by a collector in an attempt to make the story easier to understand.",
