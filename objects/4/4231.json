  "text": "These four sketches exemplify the liveliness and effectiveness of Rajput drawing. Numerous drawings such as the court ladies and poppy blossom shown here were done as conceptual studies for finished paintings. Others, like the Ramayana scene, may have been compositional underdrawings for unfinished paintings. The Orissan drawing of Shiva and Parvati was probably considered complete as is.",
