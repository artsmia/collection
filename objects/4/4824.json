  "text": "The coffee and tea service that Maher designed for Rockledge llustrates his adherence to the progressive idea of a unified interior.  Emblazoned on each piece, along with the King monogram, is the ubiquitous tiger lily, one of Maher's dominant motifs for the house.  The service also exhibits the trapezoidal dentils and flattened arch that Maher used as architectural detailing.  This set was custom-made by the Gorham Manufacturing Company as part of their exclusive \"Martelé\" line.  The hand-hammered surface (martelé means \"hammered\") is characteristic of Arts and Crafts metalwork of the period.",
