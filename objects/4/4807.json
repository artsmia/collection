  "text": "Using the skills of local cotton weavers, Alexander Morton developed a distinctive patterned gauze fabric which he called Madras Muslin . The name was probably chosen because Asian associations were popular with customers at the end of the last century, and historically India was particularly famous for its fine cotton fabrics.\r\n\r\nIn addition to manufacturing his own designs and specialty textiles for English and Scottish markets, he produced fabrics for Morris & Co. and Liberty of London. The color and balance of this curtain suggest that it may have been made for Liberty to supply their French market.",
