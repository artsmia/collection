  "text": "This ornately carved wooden panel depicts the marriage of Shiva and Parvati. It would have functioned as a door lintel in an upper-class south Indian household in Karnataka, southwest India. The sculpture is densely packed with figures representing various manifestations of the god Shiva drawn from Hindu mythology. To the right is Kama, god of love, with his bow, whose task was to aid Parvati in her seduction of Shiva. To the left of Kama is the divine couple riding the bull Nandi, Shiva’s vehicle, followed by Shiva’s son, Skanda, god of war, astride his peacock and holding a lance.",
