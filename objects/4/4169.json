  "text": "This ornately carved wooden panel, depicting the marriage of Shiva and Parvati (<I>Kalyanasundara</I>)in its central register, functioned as a door lintel in an upper-class south Indian household in Karnataka. The sculpture is densely packed with figural images representing various manifestations of the god Shiva drawn from Hindu mythology. To the right is Kama, god of love, with his bow, whose task was to aid Parvati in her seduction of Shiva. To the left of Kama is the divine couple riding Shiva's vehicle, the bull, Nandin, followed by Shiva's son, Skanda, god of war, astride his peacock holding a lance. The marriage ceremony in the center depicts Shiva and Parvati, the god Brahma, various musicians and worshipful figures attending a joyous event.",
