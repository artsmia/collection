  "text": "Similar to Tiffany in America, the Daum Frères firm in France gained international recognition for its mastery of Art Nouveau designs. Among the wide variety of  glass manufactured by the Daum family firm, the best known are their stylized organic forms created through carving encased glass.  As seen in this vase, a bitumen-resist was painted on the glass to depict thistle and floral motifs, and then the vase was placed in hydroflouric acid to reduce unpainted areas.  The process was repeated to create the textured layers of the design.  Daum's knowledge and skill with glass earned a grand prize at the Paris International Exhibition in 1900.  About the same time, Daum united with the firms of Emile Gallé (glass), Louis Majorelle (furniture), and Victor Prouvé (interior design) to create the Alliance Provinciale des Industries d'Art (later named École de Nancy), which fostered art production in Nancy.",
