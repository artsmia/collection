  "text": "James Bassler's work is representative of the personal expression that characterized the art forms of the 20th century. Bassler, like many artists of the period, explored ethnographic art and techniques to help them move beyond the boundaries established by their traditional cultural. Employing techniques once used by Navajo weavers, but altering the density and incorporating a variety of natural and synthetic materials, Bassler has created a metaphorical form that represents the coverings of his spirit. As one moves through life, the \"skin\"/layers of this covering are peeled away.",
