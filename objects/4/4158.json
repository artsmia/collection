  "text": "Amaral's frequent use of metallic foil and or paint give her work a particularly lustrous quality and add a sense of the luxurious not usually associated with this period.  Her early and continued exposure to ethnographic and archeological textiles from her home in Colombia are obviously reflected in this piece, but have also been an influence on the \"patina\" that is characteristic of many of her larger works.",
