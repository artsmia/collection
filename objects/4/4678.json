  "text": "Jaromír Funke was a leading figure of experimental Czech photography in the 1920s and 1930s. He was interested in revealing the aesthetic quality of insignificant objects, and he used mirrors and lights to transform his still-life arrangements into abstractions. Composition is from the Glass and Reflection series, in which the artist endeavored to use shadow and reflections to mimic the look of photomontage, a popular technique at the time, which involved cutting, arranging, and pasting together multiple photographs to produce a composite image.",
