  "text": "After having been accepted into the Prague Photo Club, Jaromír Funke rejected what he considered to be its conservative approach to photography. He wished to experiment with his compositions, learning from fellow local photographers and writings in avant-garde art journals from the United States and Europe. For photographs such as this one, Funke arranged pieces of glass, board, and possibly mirrors. He played with their reflections and shadows in a composition whose angular and layered items might remind one of Cubist paintings.",
