  "text": "This design reflects Purcell's fascination with modern technology. In 1939 Purcell wrote about his inspiration for these windows. In 1909 at the Orpheum vaudeville show Purcell saw a moving picture called The June Bug featuring the aviator Glenn Curtiss flying his biplane. To partners who were endeavoring in their work to relate Architecture and the Machine, such a sight gave serious pause. I made a record of my feelings by putting a 'June Bug' biplane against some big piled-up clouds in the leaded glass transoms of the new Stricker dining room bay window.",
