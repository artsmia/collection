  "text": "The eighteen arhats were enlightened disciples of Buddha and protectors of the Buddhist law. In contrast with Wang Jian’s monochrome fine-line style (also on view), this version features a colorful, realistic approach. \r\n\r\nDing Yunpeng was a renowned professional painter of the Ming dynasty (1368–1644), best known for his paintings of Buddhist and Daoist subjects. Ding’s work was in great demand in his day, and his style was widely imitated. His own studio produced commissions in the style of the master, which often bore his signature. This painting is not likely from Ding Yunpeng’s own hand but from one of his followers.",
