  "text": "Hideho Tanaka studied industrial arts and design at the Musashino Art University in Tokyo. His work deals with both philosophical and metaphysical ideas, and he often endeavors to connect the realm of the physical world with unseen spiritual planes. He attempts to bridge this gap through forms that suggest the frailty and transience of the human experience. The medium of fiber is versatile and allows Tanaka creative freedom. In Vanishing, several layers of thin wire have been loosely bound with piles of light-colored fibers in the middle of each layer. As a result, the artist creates a contrast between the stiff wire and the short pieces of malleable fiber on the top of each layer, as well as a suggestion of mass.",
