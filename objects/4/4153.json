  "text": "Ed Rossbach studied at the University of Washington and the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Michigan where he graduated with a Master of Fine Arts in ceramics and weaving. Rossbach was an innovator in the field of fiber art and is known for his wit. He was fascinated with the structure of textiles and the way in which the constituent parts of material move over and under each other. Rossbach applied techniques such as basket-weaving, macramé and plaiting to unconventional, everyday materials, such as newspaper, cardboard and plastic tubing in order to create a variety of three-dimensional forms. In <I>Newspaper Knot</I>, the artist has crumpled the paper and enclosed it in plastic secured by string to form the knot.",
