  "text": "Sunshine and Shadow. Trip Around the World. Grandmotherâ€™s Dream. This traditional Amish pattern goes by many evocative names. This version of the classic design features bright, saturated colors. Though Amish people lived in fairly isolated communities, their striking quilts eventually grabbed the attention of cultural outsiders, and in the 1940s a tourist market for Amish quilts started to take shape. In quilts made for sale the color combinations tend to be more vibrant and the hand-stitching less fine than in those intended for home use.",
