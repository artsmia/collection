  "text": "Although the Sèvres factory is noted for its eighteenth and early nineteenth century ceramics, the firm continued to manufacture designs by contemporary artists, including many pieces in the Art Deco style of the 1920s and 1930s. Henri Rapin, director of art projects at the Sèvres factory between 1920 and 1934, designed the forms of several pieces, then collaborated on the decoration with contemporary artists. Little is known about the designer of the abstracted floral decoration on this vase, Odartchenko, who worked at Sèvres for a short time beginning in 1925. The decoration on this vase was executed by Prosper-Joseph Walter who worked at Sèvres from 1919 to 1928.",
