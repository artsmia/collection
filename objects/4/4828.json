  "text": "This folio from the <I>Bhāgavata Purāna</I> (<I>The Ancient Story of the Blessed One</I>) is significant because its early date places it among the few surviving pre-Mughal examples of Indian painting made for Hindu patronage. The series it comes from is among the earliest to establish the existence of a pre-Mughal painting style for Hindu patrons and audiences. Bold colors, vigorous movement, and inventive compositions that convey energy characterize the painting. The episode here shows <I>gopis</I>, the female cowherd devotees of Krishna, searching for their lord. Divided into two horizontal registers, they ask the trees and plants in the forest where their divine lover is.",
