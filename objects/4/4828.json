  "art_champions_text": "Conservation Cost $4,360.00\r\n\r\nThis important painting comes from a manuscript nicknamed the “Scotch-tape” Bhagavata Purana (Ancient Story of the Blessed One), so called because a previous owner opted to stabilize the folios’ frayed corners with cellophane tape! It is the earliest known illustrated manuscript to chronicle the life story of the beloved Lord Krishna. Here, the artist captures the fervent ardor of the gopis (cowherd wives) as they search for their divine love in a fantastical, moonlit forest. The bold use of color, exaggerated gestures, and bristling costumes mark the crystallization of a pre-Mughal style, which, along with the exploits of Krishna, would become salient features of Indian court painting thereafter.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAt present, the condition of this historically significant work is unstable. Conservation must be done to consolidate and prevent active flaking of the pigments; replace detrimental paper fills and hinges; repair minor tears; and surface clean the front and back to remove\r\n\r\ngrime and enhance viewing.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nContact the Chinese, South and Southeast Asian Art Department at CSSAA@artsmia.org or (612) 870-3220 to Champion this artwork.\r\n\r\n ",

  "text": "This folio from the Bhāgavata Purāna (The Ancient Story of the Blessed One) is significant because its early date places it among the few surviving pre-Mughal examples of Indian painting made for Hindu patronage. The series it comes from is among the earliest to establish the existence of a pre-Mughal painting style for Hindu patrons and audiences. Bold colors, vigorous movement, and inventive compositions that convey energy characterize the painting. The episode here shows gopis, the female cowherd devotees of Krishna, searching for their lord. Divided into two horizontal registers, they ask the trees and plants in the forest where their divine lover is.",
