  "text": "This folio from the Bhāgavata Purāna (The Ancient Story of the Blessed One) is significant because its early date places it among the few surviving pre-Mughal examples of Indian painting made for Hindu patronage. The series it comes from is among the earliest to establish the existence of a pre-Mughal painting style for Hindu patrons and audiences. Bold colors, vigorous movement, and inventive compositions that convey energy characterize the painting. The episode here shows gopis, the female cowherd devotees of Krishna, searching for their lord. Divided into two horizontal registers, they ask the trees and plants in the forest where their divine lover is.",
