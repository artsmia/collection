  "text": "This painting comes from the first illustrated series of the <I>Bhagavata Purana (Ancient Story of the Blessed One)</I>, a text composed in the 800s–1000s ce that chronicles the life story of Lord Krishna. Here, the artist inventively translates verse to image, with two registers of lovesick <I>gopis</I> (cowherd wives) chasing the call of Krishna’s flute in a fantastical moonlit forest. The bold use of color, exaggerated gestures, and bristling costumes marks the crystallization of a pre-Mughal style. Inherited from earlier traditions, this visual language would influence the Indian court painting to follow. \r\nRecent conservation of this painting was made possible by a generous contribution from Al and Dena Naylor through Mia’s Art Champions program.",
