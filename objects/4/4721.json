  "text": "Though it’s called a charger, this piece is more like a bowl or a deep dish. Yet it is still meant to be viewed as a two-dimensional artwork, such as a painting, and was probably hung on the wall, as it is here. Like a painting, the charger has a “frame,” in this case made with a geometric border. Inside the frame, swirling flowers (perhaps poppies) envelop the viewer, forming a second framing device for the water and the midnight blue sky.",
