  "text": "Distinguished by its imposing size, this spectacular mirror stand demonstrates the decorative tradition of Ming-style furniture. The back simulates a five-panel screen of the type used as the backdrop for thrones. The panels each have dragon-head terminals and their openwork carving is decorated with sinuous dragons and phoenixes amid clouds. The drawers are embellished with auspicious flowers and phoenixes while the railing posts terminate in dragons and lotus blossoms. A round mirror would have been supported on the s-shaped easel whose central openwork panel displays a four-clawed, horned dragon. The five deep drawers would have provided ample storage for hairpins, combs, and cosmetics. The extensive use of dragons and phoenixes—imperial imagery— indicate that this dressing table cabinet once belonged to a woman of the royal household.",
