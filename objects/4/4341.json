  "text": "Auspicious animals carved in the round, often following the contours of the jade pebble from which they were formed, were extremely popular during the Ming dynasty (1368-1644). This image of a goose grasping a lotus flower is remarkable for its size, as well as for the colors of the stone. Although the surface is finely worked in meticulous detail, there remains a strong sense of the Ming preference for natural, organic shapes and an understated carving technique. Pieces such as this, popular since the Tang dynasty (618-906), were displayed as decorative objects. Impressive in both size and color, this carving would have attracted attention in any jade cabinet.",
