Howard \"The Choice of the Private Trader\" pg. 88\r\n\r\nDecorated on the rim with feathery scrolls in bright enamels; the central scene after a European original of a troubadour with his lute beneath a tree, sitting beside two barrels with a decanter and wine glasses, while a young man caresses a girl beside him.\r\n\r\nThis version of a country music party has a distinctly Continental flavour and is one of at least six such scenes which illustrate musicians in gently amorous situations - all after European originals of the period 1735 - 50.",
