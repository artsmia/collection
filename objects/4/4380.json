  "text": "Unusually sophisticated in their abstract design, these women's ear ornaments are comprised of various geometric elements including spheres, cones, arches and circles. Stylized snake heads with pointed noses can be discerned, however. This iconography reflects the power of snakes to inflict harm as well as to act as symbols of protection. In south India, snakes are also worshipped as emblems of procreation and fertility.",
