  "text": "The zither, or <I>qin</I>, has been regarded as a symbol of enlightenment by the Chinese since Confucian times (6th century BCE). By the seventeenth century, it was a required object in most scholars' studies, if only for display. This rare example has inscriptions on the bottom, including the title <I>Zhong He</I> (middle harmony) and the number 57. One of a series made in 1634 for Prince Lu, a son of the Wanli emperor, it was probably given as a gift to a friend or member of his aristocratic literary circle. The instrument also bears the gilded mark <I>Luguo shi quan</I> (heirloom of the Lu State) and an engraved poem, signed by Jingyi Zhuren, that reads:\r\n<BR>\r\n<P><I>The moonlight is reflected in the Yangzi;\r\n<P>A light breeze blows over clear dew drops.\r\n<P>Only in a tranquil place\r\n<P>Can one comprehend the feeling of eternity.</I>\r\n<BR>\r\n<P>Apparently, scholars liked having a variety of inscriptions and seals affixed to an otherwise utilitarian object.",
