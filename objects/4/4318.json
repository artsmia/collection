  "text": "Ghanaian legend tells of a young Asante girl named Akua, who, after having trouble conceiving, consulted a diviner. The diviner recommended that Akua commission a woodcarving of a small child and that she treat the statue as she would a real child. When the people of her village saw Akua carrying the wooden child on her back in her wrapper, they laughed and teased her. However, Akua soon gave birth to a healthy baby girl. Her success inspired other women to have carvings made and in her honor, they became known as Akua'ba, Akua's child. Today, akua'mma (pl.) are largely produced as souvenirs for sale to tourists.",
