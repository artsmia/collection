  "text": "<I>Chicha</I> - fermented maize beer - was served in keros at Inka religious ceremonies and social celebrations. The imagery on this kero is divided into three registers. At the top, men participate in a procession or mock battle carrying drums, staffs, weapons, and a flag. Two wear Spanish costume; the others are dressed as Antis or Chunchos, enemies of the Inka from the neighboring Amazon region. The middle band is decorated with <I>tocapu</I> - symbolic geometric designs adapted from Andean textiles. Indigenous birds and flowers adorn the lower register.",
