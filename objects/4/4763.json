  "text": "For George Morrison, horizon paintings represented an aesthetic and psychological engagement with nature, one that combined the subconscious and perceptual: “I am fascinated with the ambiguity, the change of the many moods and colors, the sense of sound and movement above and below the [horizon] line. Therein lies some of the mystery of painting: the transmutations, the choosing and manipulation of pigment that becomes the substance of art.”",
