  "text": "These lacquered armchairs with distinctive scrolled-crest back splat, slender construction, and gilt decoration reflect the fashion of the Qianlong period (1736-1795) toward increasingly elaborate forms. Fashioned from thin members, the chairs exhibit the light angular fretwork typical of middle Qing taste. The splats display stylized dragon medallions and bamboo leaves executed in gold lacquer on a reddish-brown ground. At least five similar chairs are known in Western collections.",
