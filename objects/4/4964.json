  "text": "Designed for the dressing table, this small mirror cabinet contains three drawers in its base surmounted by a three-sided, openwork frame resembling a throne with two arms and a tall back. The five-carved panels of the back display confronting dragons, a lotus pond with ducks and plum blossoms. The lower side panels are decorated with the swastika-shaped <I>wau</I> character denoting ten thousand good works. A round mirror would have been supported within the upper frame.",
