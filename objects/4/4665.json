  "text": "The weavers of San Juan Comalapa produce two distinct styles of huipil. The <I>mero</I> (pure) Comalapa huipil is distinguished by the use of a <I>cuyuscate</I> (natural brown cotton) or white ground, a bright red <I>creya</I> (band) at the shoulders and <I>rujiki 7al</I> bands of narrow stripes) separating rows of patterning. The newer <I>sanmartineco</I> (in the style of San Martín) huipil is totally different with its indigo, black, or green ground cloth and the use of modern, naturalistic floral imagery.\r\n\tBoth styles have everyday and a festive versions which are differntiated by subtle nuances. The ceremonial <I>mero Comalapa</I> huipil is very large and is worn like a poncho over an everyday huipil. The festive <I.>sanmartineco</I> huipil has elaborate floral designs brocaded in silk or sedalina yarn rather than cotton.\r\n",
