  "text": "These two bowls would have been used on the scholar's desk as brush washers. The larger one retains the original surface of the boulder from which it was carved. This respect for the natural shapes and muted colors of nephrite perfectly reflected Ming scholarly taste. Used in China since prehistoric times, jade held ancient connotations for the literati. The scholar's preference for natural form and understated color stands in marked contrast to the aristocracy's desire for the larger, more intricatedly carved and brightly colored jades. The smaller brush washer has a four character mark that reads, \"appreciated by Qianlong,\" who ruled from 1736-1795.",
