  "text": "Nonomura Ninsei produced refined pottery decorated with colorful enamels and his style exerted enormous influence on other ceramists active in Kyoto during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. In addition to this highly decorative style, Ninsei also created a number of works that more closely reflected the subtle styles traditionally associated with the tea ceremony. This tall flower vase reflects his interest in earlier ceramics produced in Seto, near Nagoya. The thick application of iron rich glaze resulted in a deep brown surface and the interesting \"accidental\" drip effect.",
