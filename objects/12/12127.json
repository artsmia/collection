  "text": "Songhua stone from Jilin, with its typical green tone, was reserved almost exclusively for imperial use during the Kangxi (1662-1722), Yongzheng (1722-1735), and Qianlong (1736-1795) periods. The reverse of this horizontally striated ink stone has a brief engraved couplet written in the hand of the Kangxi emperor. It reads: \"used in tranquility, this inkstone will last many lifetimes.\" The poem is followed by two rectangular seals of the Kangxi emperor. The front is carved in relief with the design of a leafy peach floating upon waves. The peach is carved out as the \"water pool\" for the ink to collect in. \r\nThe two most noteworthy carvers of ink stones in the Kangxi imperial workshops were Jin Dianyang and Gu Gongwang, one of whom likely carved this fine stone. It was customary for imperial artisans to remain anonymous, and all imperial Songhua ink stones are unsigned.",
