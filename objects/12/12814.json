  "text": "Designed to resemble an ordinary mail-order catalogue, Marshall Weber's artist's book parodies his subject through mimicry and the fragmentation of familiar images into surreal, sometimes unsettling compositions. By appropriating pictures and text from actual sales catalogues, Weber created a series of collages that challenge contemporary standards of beauty and the social attitudes that often value youth over wisdom, physical appearance over spiritual strength, and consumerism over community.  Weber's masquerade is at once revealing and troubling in its condemnation of superficial social norms.",
