  "text": "The <i>phurba</i> is used in Tibetan Buddhism during rites to exorcise evil influences. Shaped like a tent peg, the ritual weapon is employed to pin down demons harmful to Buddhist thought in order to tame and teach them.\r\n\r\nMade in an imperial workshop for ceremonial use in the Chinese court or as tribute, this <i>phurba</i> has an elaborate handle sitting atop a three-sided blade. At one end of the handle is a three-headed <i>makara</i>, a mythological sea creature. At the other are three grimacing faces of Nagpo chenpo (Sanskrit: Mahakala), a deity charged with protecting Buddhism, each wearing a crown of three seated buddhas.\r\n",
