  "text": "Among the Zulu peoples, home-brewed sorghum beer is the preferred food of the ancestors. Beer drinking is an indispensable part of communal celebrations of lifeâ€™s milestones, including birth, marriage, and death. Pots for serving and drinking beer are embellished with textured patterns, some of which are figurative, and then blackened in a smoky reduction firing of grass or dung. Blackening attracts the ancestors, whose presence and blessing are desired.",
