Ericsson Company, the <I>Ericofon</I> represents the incorporation of new materials into Scandinavian design of the post-war period.  Designers Blomberg, Lysell, and Thames used lightweight plastic to create a practical, one-piece phone with the dial on the bottom, retaining the functionalism of previous decades while experimenting with a sculptural, curved form often described as a cobra.",
