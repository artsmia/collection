  "text": "The festival of Purim celebrates a victory of the Jewish people over oppression as recounted in the story of Esther.  Esther, a young Jewish woman raised by her uncle Mordecai, becomes queen to the Persian King Ahasuerus (Xerxes I).  The king’s evil advisor Haman plans to destroy the entire Jewish people to satisfy his grudge against Mordecai, but the tables are turned when Esther reveals to the king that she is a Jew and convinces him spare her people and punish Haman instead.  The megillah (scroll) is read in the synagogue during Purim services.  In a festival atmosphere worshippers dress as their favorite Purim characters and rattle their groggers (noisemakers) at each mention of the evil Haman’s name.",
