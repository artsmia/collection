  "text": "Carved overall in the shape of a conch shell, this small ink stone reflects late Qing dynasty taste for complex forms. The tuan stone is of characteristic purple tone and several of the naturally occurring yellow-green \"eye\" inclusions have been carved into the decorative scheme. The low-relief barnacles adhering to the top and bottom as well as the small crab perched near the well all feature a yellow-green \"eye\" inclusion in their center. These inclusions were prized features of tuan stone and were often given emphasis in the carved designs.",
