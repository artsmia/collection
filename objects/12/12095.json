  "text": "A scarcity of huang-hua-li hardwood had set in by the early Ch'ing dynasty and craftsmen turned to more abundant local hardwoods such as walnut. Though softer than huang-hua-li, walnut had a fine grain and could be waxed to a mellow luster. A pleasing shape, this barrel-form stool incorporates four legs into its light framework. Most Chinese stools of this type will use four, five, or six legs. The fewer the number of legs, the less expensive to produce.",
