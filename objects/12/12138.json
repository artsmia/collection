  "text": "John Bradstreet acquired a cast of Falguiere's bust of Diana shortly after its creation.  He displayed it prominently in his Minneapolis apartment, as seen atop a pedestal in the adjacent portrait by Douglas Volk.  In 1968 a donor gave an example of this popular bronze to the Minneapolis Institute of Art, reuniting Bradstreet with the goddess.  Derived from a larger composition, Diana's otherworldly status is only indicated through the half-moon atop her head.",
