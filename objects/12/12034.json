  "text": "\"Head of Montserrat, No. 2\" is one of several sculptures Gonzàlez created in 1941 and 1942 in response to the horrors of the Spanish civil war (1936-39). Living and working in Paris during the German occupation, Gonzàlez was also profoundly affected by the events of World War II which were unfolding around him. Both wars were turning points for him as an artist. His use of figurative forms in the \"Montserrat\" series marked a departure from his abstract wrought-iron constructions of the 1930s, enabling him to evoke human agony through gesture and expression.
