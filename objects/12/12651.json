  "text": "<p>Technical advances in the areas of dye chemistry, textile printing and manufacturing at the end of the 18th century made it possible to produce patterned cotton fabrics at reasonably affordable prices. The printed fabrics of the 19th century were used for apparel as well as home-furnishings, for everything from table linens to bed curtains.  The designs developed for the furnishing fabrics tended to be larger in scale than those developed for clothing.\n</p><p>This particular print with its ornate baroque columns and elaborately dressed party-goers seems to satirize the extravagance of Italian Venetian fÃªtes.</p>",
