  "text": "This hand-built vessel has been decorated with incised patterns and three nonfunctional handles made of pinched clay. During the period leading up to the Warring States period (475-221 BCE), craftsmen working in the south in Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces used high-fired clay to create utilitarian vessels of basic designs. The hard stoneware was durable, practical, and impervious to water.",
