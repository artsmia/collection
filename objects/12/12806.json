  "text": "Architect Ralph Rapson was one of the first designers recruited by Hans Knoll to position Knoll Associates as a modern furniture firm. Though few of Rapson’s designs actually went into production, this rocker was well received and became the signature piece of the Rapson Line. A familiar form updated with a bentwood frame and webbed seat and back, the design is especially significant for Minneapolis, where Rapson moved in 1954 to head the University of Minnesota School of Architecture. The Rapson Line was only manufactured from 1945 to 1946, with materials available during World War II (1939–45).",
