  "text": "Its sleigh feet, horizontal speed lines, and chrome plating gave the impression that cleaning would be a breeze, and its bold graphics on a red background proclaimed the name brand. The Electrolux Model 30 was the second generation of the canister vacuum, pioneered by the company in 1924. Guild's streamlined Model 30, introduced in 1937, was extremely successful. This versatile vacuum also had a polishing attachment, a floor cleaner, and vaporizer for dipersing moth crystals.\r\n\r\nLurelle Guild's corporate clients included Westinghouse, Alcoa, and Electrolux, and he helped to modernize the new material of aluminum through his product designs. But it was Guild's Electrolux Model 30, however, for which he is best known. Unlike many manufacturers at this time, who practiced the annual model change, Electrolux manufactured this popular vacuum cleaner, with few tweaks, into the 1950s.",
