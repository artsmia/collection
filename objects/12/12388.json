  "text": "Two <I>ōban</I> sheets were joined vertically to create a large image of a beautiful woman. Such formats are called <I>kakemono-e</I> (hanging scroll pictures) as they were often mounted onto a simple hanging scroll with a paper border and backing. They were used by townspeople as relatively inexpensive interior decoration. For this reason, these prints rarely survived in their original state and condition.",
