  "text": "This shallow round basin is hand-built from clay coils and is very heavily potted. The vessel closely follows the shape of bronze tripod water basins of the Eastern Zhou period (770-221 BCE). The outside has three animal masks holding loose rings similar to the bronze vessels it imitates. The broad rim and exterior are decorated with stamped spiral designs also in vague imitation of late Zhou bronze decoration.",
