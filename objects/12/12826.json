  "text": "The Yuan dynasty (1280-1368) was an era of experiment and innovation for kilns in the vicinity of Ching-te-ch'en in Kiangsu province. One of the distinct porcelain types to evolve was Shu-fu which takes its name from the low-relief moulded characters shu and fu meaning, \"privy council\" that often appear, as they do here, on the inside of the bowls and small dishes. Shu-fu ware is generally carefully potted with fine, hard bodies and thick, opaque white glazes with a slight blue-green tint.",
