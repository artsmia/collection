Sometimes referred to as the \"Father of Hindi literature,\" Kabir (pronounced ka-beer) was spiritually significant to Hindus, Sikhs, and Muslims for his easily accessible philosophy and lifelong efforts to unite all religious sects under a single overarching principle of peace and human understanding. Translated from Hindi by Rabindranach Tagore and Robert Bly, the poems are representative of Kabir's simple spiritual message.",
