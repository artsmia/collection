  "text": "These small, beautifully painted cards were used in Tibetan Buddhist initiation ceremonies or temple consecrations.  They would have been arranged on a platform before a deity, along with other offerings and adornments.The front of each card has an image of a deity or lama painted in brilliant red wash and applied gold foil on the front, while the back is inscribed with a mantra related to the depicted individual. These particular paintings are from a well known set of at least thirty cards made for the third Abbot of Taglung in Tibet,  Sangye Yarjon (1203-72). Yarjon is credited with having warded off Mongol invasions in Tibet by teaching the potential invaders the Buddhist doctrine.",
