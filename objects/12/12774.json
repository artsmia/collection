  "text": "These two uniquely shaped rawhide cases highlight the technically skilled artistic abilities of Tsistsistas (Cheyenne) and Inua-ina (Arapaho) artists. Because they were allies, the Arapaho and the Tsistsistas share some artistic qualities, particularly their use of delicately drawn lines. The pattern you see on the fringed bag is one of three distinct patterns used by the Tsistsistas on their bags. This artist emphasizes the power of color in her dramatic shapes. There is a sense of balance as the amount of colored and uncolored areas are distributed evenly.",
