  "text": "This finely preserved and colorful <i>thangka</i> is likely from a larger set that depicted important lamas (teachers) of the Sakya (“red hat”) lineage. In such portrayals, one or two lamas are usually represented as large figures in the center surrounded by smaller depictions of monks of lesser repute. Here, the two large figures are Ketsum Chenpo Namko Legpa and Palden Lama Dampa Sonam Gyaltsen. Tibetan artists adopted the Chinese tradition of depicting Buddhist holy men in a landscape setting. This practice reached its height in the 17th century, with blue-green hills, strange rock formations, and extravagant, colorful flowers suggesting a gemlike otherworld.",
