  "text": "This slender dancer is dressed in the traditional <I>shen yi</I> garment; long and layered robes with oversized sleeves. Kneeling down, she is caught in the motion of pulling her full sleeves up into graceful pleated folds capturing the formal spirit of the sleeve tossing dance.\r\n\r\n<P>A great many ceramic replicas of the real world including all forms of architectural models, farmyard animals, and human figures were buried in the elaborate tombs of Han aristocracy. These extraordinary examples of ceramic sculpture tell us a great deal about the customs, lifestyles, and cultural refinement of the ancient Chinese.",
