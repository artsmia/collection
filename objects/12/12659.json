  "text": "<p>Elaborate silk fabric, with its large, multi colored, detailed design, was very costly to produce.  It would have taken at least two highly skilled weavers, using the most sophisticated weaving technology of the period, several days to produce one yard of cloth.\n</p><p>This panel was undoubtedly part of a special order and could have been intended for any number of uses, ranging from wall covering to men's or women's clothing.  It was not until the middle of the 19th century that textiles were designed for specialty markets such as home furnishings or fashion.</p>",
