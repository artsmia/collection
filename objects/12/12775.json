  "text": "In the early 1970s, George Morrison began a series of abstract pen and ink drawings on various colors of paper that feature elaborate, patterns of parallel and intersecting lines covering the entire surface of the paper. As in this example, he introduced a prominent horizon line in the upper portion of the composition, signifying the drawings as abstracted landscapes with distinct areas of sky and ground meeting at the horizon. Like Morrison’s grand wood collages of the same period, these dynamic “weave” drawings display textured surfaces, realized as intricate passages of fine-lined cross-hatching and shimmering forms arising through chance.",
