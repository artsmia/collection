It was transmitted to China (where it is known as pipa) around 2,000 years ago and to Japan by the 700s The oldest illustrations of The Tale of Genji that survive today, which were created around 1130, include a picture of one of the novelâ€™s main characters, Prince Niou, playing a similar lute next to his pregnant wife, Nakanokimi.",
