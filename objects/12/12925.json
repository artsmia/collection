  "text": "A garniture is a set of items, usually vases, whose only purpose is to decorate, and five-piece garnitures were the most prestigious decoration for a mantelpiece or the top of a cupboard. This set was made in the Netherlands, but its bird and flower decoration, as well as its color scheme of blue and white with orange and green, draws inspiration from imported Chinese porcelain, which was widely admired but too expensive for most Dutch people at the time.",
