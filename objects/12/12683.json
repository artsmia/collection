  "text": "The term <i>wucai</i> means “five colors” but was used generically to mean “polychrome, ” regardless of how many colors actually appeared on a vessel. The <i>wucai</i> overglaze colors included red, blue, green, yellow, and purple, and during the Ming dynasty they were usually used in conjunction with underglaze cobalt blue designs. \r\n\r\nMade at Jingdezhen, this rare, porcelain brushrest is molded in the form of a three-peak mountain with a dragon in relief encircling each peak. The central dragon and some motifs are outlined with underglaze cobalt oxide, while the flanking dragons, mountains, waves, clouds, and cusped apron are painted with red, yellow, and green with some black outlining—all in overglaze enamels. The development of overglaze polychrome enamels is one of the most important contributions of the Ming dynasty potter to ceramic history.",
