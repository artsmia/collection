  "text": "Distinctly formed jars, consisting of footless globular containers with short, vertical necks decorated with bosses and a thick, rolled-lip rim are associated with the Qili kilns at Kanzhou in Jiangxi province. While these unique jars vary in their size, their use of  \"willow-basket\" marking, and glazed versus unglazed exteriors all have brown-glazed interiors. Because they range in size from small to large, these jars are often called \"rice measures\" in English, but their exact function remains unknown. Basket-weave designs were evident by the eleventh century in both porcelain and stoneware. The best known willow-basket jars, however, are the brown-glazed variety like this datable to the late Song and Yuan dynasties (13th-14th century).",
