  "text": "Wan-hsiao Studio is the pseudonym of Chou Shang-huan, a scholar and amateur painter from Fujian province. At the age of 79, he had completed a series of 120 portraits of famous historical figures and, in 1743, he had plates carved of each of them in Kuang-tung province. Because he had spent a lifelong effort on these portraits, he employed some of the best carvers available in that southern province.\r\n<P>The four volumes describe historical figures from the Han to Ming dynasties (206 B.C.-A.D.1644). The author combined what limited written descriptions existed with his imaginative illustrations. Each of the exemplary characters thus has a short biography and the list includes wise emperors, virtuous queens, generals, literati, Buddhist monks, Taoist Priests, and filial sons and daughters.",
