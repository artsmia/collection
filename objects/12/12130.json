  "text": "Cut from a large oval section of bamboo, this thick-walled brushpot is deeply carved with a scene depicting the Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove. The legendary seven sages were historical figures of immense literary refinement who were frequently depicted in scholars' items. The central group is shown standing amongst bamboo admiring a scroll. To their left another figure overlooks two seated sages playing <I>wei-ch'i</I>, a form of chess. A short poetic inscription is engraved in the top right-hand corner describing the sages within their pine and bamboo setting.",
