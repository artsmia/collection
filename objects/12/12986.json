  "text": "This elegant German Art Deco-style tea service was purchased at the 1999 Annual Antiques Show and Sale, as an intended gift to The Minneapolis Institute of Arts. The teapot and sugar are constructed of oval forms, stacked skyscraper-like, with little ornamentation. A silver rectangle links the counter-curved handles to the bodies of the teapot and creamer, adding an industrial, machine-age feel. At this time, both the maker and the client are unknown.",
