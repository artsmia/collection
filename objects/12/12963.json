  "text": "This extraordinary ceremonial vessel, one of a group, was discovered in the Lopburiâ€“Pa Sak basin in central Thailand. The oldest settlements in this region date back over three thousand years and have yielded several important Neolithic objects. While a few ceramic depictions of animals in Neolithic and Bronze Age Thailand are known, this water buffalo, which stands as the centerpiece of the group, exhibits an originality, creativity, and superb workmanship that has no comparison in early Thai ceramic art. It is also the largest pottery buffalo known from this period.",
