  "text": "Once the prerogative of kings, today kente cloth is worn by many Ghanaians on formal occasions. The complexity of the warp patterning establishes the prestigious quality of the cloth and the diversity of the weft patterns are often special designs developed by individual weavers within the confines of strict traditions.
