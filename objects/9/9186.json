The balloons have enigmatic titles including Vasco da Gama (a famous Portugese navigator), L'Asmodée (the name of a demon in the Book of Tobias who was thought to raise roofs of houses and discover the secrets of the inhabitants), le Protée(Proteus was a Greek sea god who could change his form at wil), and le Saint-Elme (St. Elmo's Fire was an appearance of flame on prominent points of a ship that was taken to be a bad omen by sailors).",
