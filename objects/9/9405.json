  "text": "This long slender water vessel was created in northwest China in the Yangshao period. It was used to retrieve and store water from local rivers. The long pointed end could be used to anchor the jar along  the stream in mud or in a hole dug into dirt when carried away. Some examples have been found in sites associated with Neolithic burial rituals.",
