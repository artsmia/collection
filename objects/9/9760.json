  "text": "The spikes on this jar’s surface line up in tight rows, looking like the helmets of a well-organized army. Indeed, the spikes symbolize defense against illness, misfortune, and duntundara (evil forces, which in English would translate as “witchcraft”). Vessels like this were placed on altars dedicated to a protective spirit, and they contained water or powerful medicines destined for that spirit. The lid, which is smoothly integrated into the pot’s pod-like form, protected its contents from natural and supernatural contamination.",
