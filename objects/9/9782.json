  "text": "This hand built amphora has a unique and elegant shape. Round at the base, divided into four raised spiralling sections at the body, two long handles extending to the mouth and neck which have been squared off. Small incised lines at the neck and around the spirals give definition to the design. The interplay of simple shapes make this jar feel very modern. Many of these pots were made and yet the design details remain the same; the MIA has three nearly identical jars. The same design occurs in smaller sizes and examples can be found in many museums.",
