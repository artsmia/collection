  "text": "During the 1960s Lenore Tawney focused considerable attention on breaking away from the rectangular parameters naturally dictated by the woven form.  Experimentation with structural density lead to a significant breakthrough, allowing the creation of this triangular orientation as well as other forms with an undulating vertical orientation. She created more than a dozen pieces ranging in size from the smaller format we see here to large, floor to ceiling panels. The artist envisioned the possibility of a variety of installations ranging from wall presentations to free hanging elements defining spatial areas as room dividers.  \r\n\r\nTawney is very precise about every aspect of her work and is particularly conscious of the aesthetic effects of her structural elements. The knots she so frequently uses serve to secure threads but are also intended to create a visual texture. She is equally sensitive to the effect of thread structure and weave density in proportion to overall size and emotional impact of every object she creates.",
