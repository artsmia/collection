  "text": "During much of the 20th century basic design concerns often crossed international boundaries. In this fabric and the panels to the left and right, we see designers from three different countries, Finland, England and Sweden, with a fascination for developing the possibilities of a bold, dramatic statement using a minimal design repeat, the single flower. The Scandinavian tastes favored contrasting colors combined with a large scale motif to make an impact.",
