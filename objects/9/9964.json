  "text": "Like Gabrielle Fountain's <I>Equilibrium</I> in this exhibition, <I>Highlight</I> employs an unabashedly broad range of bright colors. Phillips transitioned them from a reflective yellow to a bright fuchsia, creating a sense of three-dimensional, light-reflecting spherical forms, almost like a strand of dark pearls.  The enlargement of geometric form in this textile renders a pixilated effect, which draws from the graphics of early videogames and computer designs. <I>Highlight</I> was printed in multiple other colorways, including one incorporating an eye-popping teal, purple and red.",
