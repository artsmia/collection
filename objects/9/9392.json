  "text": "One of the most important technical innovations of the Cizhou kilns was overglaze painted polychrome decor. Enamel overglaze painting, one of the most celebrated traditions of Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1664-1911) porcelain production, can be traced to Cizhou kilns of the late Song and Jin (1115-1234) periods. Designs in red, yellow, and green enamel are painted in glazed and pre-fired plain white pieces. They are then fired at a lower temperature. The majority of these early polychrome vessels were small, shallow bowls and dishes like this example.",
