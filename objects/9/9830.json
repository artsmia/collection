  "text": "This bigwig appears to be Louis XVI out for a walk in the royal gardens with Marie-Antoinette. Though this is usually considered a French caricature, its sharp anti-French satire suggests that it may have been made by a foreigner intent on tweaking the young kingâ€™s court. The fall of the guillotine would eventually leave Louis with no place to wear his wig.",
