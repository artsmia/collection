  "text": "Although the decorative motifs of this rare eighteenth century dish are each drawn from early Ming (15th century) blue-and-white ware, no other dish with this exact combination of motifs is recorded. The central medallion is directly adopted from the lotus bouquet patterns found on Yung-lo (1403-1424) dishes like the one shown in the case to the left. The classic bouquet is encircled by sprigs of fruiting peach, pomegranate, and finger citrus.\r\n<P>Decorative elements inspired from earlier Ming wares of different forms were greatly appreciated and copied during both the Yung-cheng (1723-1735) and Ch'ien-lung (1736-1795) reign periods of the Ch'ing dynasty. Clarity of brushwork and precisely executed designs characterize imperial blue-and-white during the eighteenth century.",
