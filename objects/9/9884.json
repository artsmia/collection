  "text": "Although the decorative motifs of this rare eighteenth century dish are each drawn from early Ming (15th century) blue-and-white ware, no other dish with this exact combination of motifs is recorded. The central medallion is directly adopted from the \"lotus bouquet\" patterns found on Yung-lo (1403-1424) dishes like the one shown in the case to the left. The classic bouquet is encircled by sprigs of fruiting peach, pomegranate, and finger citrus.\r\nDecorative elements inspired from earlier Ming wares of different forms were greatly appreciated and copied during both the Yung-cheng (1723-1735) and Ch'ien-lung (1736-1795) reign periods of the Ch'ing dynasty. Clarity of brushwork and precisely executed designs characterize imperial blue-and-white during the eighteenth century.",
