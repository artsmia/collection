  "text": "The well-known Finnish designer Marjatta Metsovaara produced designs for a number of textile firms during the 1960s and 1970s. The overall patterning, the flatness of the repeating, abstracted flower and the use of saturated color proved particularly popular in the early 1970s for interior as well as fashion fabrics.",
