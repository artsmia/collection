  "text": "This miniature stoneware teapot is of the classic brick-red color associated with I-hsing ware. A brief poetic line engraved before firing reads: \r\n<I>One spoonful of talent fills eight pecks.</I>\r\nfollowed by the engraved sinature of Liu P'ei.\r\n\r\n<P>Under the base is impressed a potter's seal of Chih-yuu which might possibly be an art name of Liu P'ei. Inside the lid is a standard mark, commonly used on small teapots <I>shui-p'ing</I> indicating that the tip of the spout and the teapots rim are level so the lid will sit flat across them, a standard position indicating the pot is empty.",
