  "text": "Picasso’s art was a lifelong autobiography. His candid recognition of his motivation to depict women is apparent here as the faun, his alter ego, lifts the blanket to gaze at the sleeping woman. The image recalls the story of the god Jupiter transforming himself into a satyr who voyeuristically gazes upon the beautiful Antiope. Over the last 500 years, many artists, including the likes of Titian and Rembrandt, have explored this story of voyeurism and lust.",
