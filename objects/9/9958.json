  "text": "Dunthorne's stunning design evokes its namesake, with the squares laid out similar to a tiled floor.  The columns represent a range of colors, from a dark espresso brown on the left to a bright orange on the right.  On close study, the viewer sees that rather than being entirely saturated with color, the squares have softness in the way they are filled, giving a looser, more natural feel to the design.  These elements contrast to those found in designer Barbara Brown's textiles, four of which are on view in this show.  Where Brown's patterns feature hard lines and saturated color, Dunthorne's Patio juxtaposes soft and hard in its design, while still maintaining an architectural reference.",
