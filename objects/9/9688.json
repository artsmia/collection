  "text": "Both vases are painted with almost identical decoration: the same quaint view of a Dutch landscape, featuring a house by a river, a sailboat, and flying birds. The repetition of the scene reveals that these two vases were once part of a so-called garniture, or a grouping of either three or five vases, to be symmetrically arranged above a mantelpiece or other domestic furniture.",
