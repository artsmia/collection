  "text": "James Innes spent much of his brief adulthood in the warm climate of southern France and Spain due to an advancing case of tuberculosis. It is probably in the foothills of the Pyrenees mountains that he made this dynamic view of the countryside. Despite his travels, he was at the nexus of Londonâ€™s avant-garde art scene as a member of the forward-looking Camden Town Group. Augustus John, a fellow member of the Group remembered him as a colorful character who wore tall pilgrim hats and colorful silk scarves, carried a gold-headed ebony cane, and masked his Welsh origins with a phony English accent.",
