  "text": "One of the most celebrated and innovative printmakers of the twentieth century, Johns often explored themes and subjects in more than one medium. In this color lithograph of 1964, published by the preeminent collaborative print workshop of Universal Limited Art Editions, he presents a two-dimensional rendering of his own painted bronze sculpture of two Ballantine ale cans, one opened, one unopened. Johns' reliance on everyday objects or standardized images (numbers, letters, flags, maps, targets) as motifs and his use of simple, straightforward compositions were part of a deliberate attempt to neutralize the subject of his works, while also eliminating any suggestion of narrative content. This approach forced the viewer to look at the surface, texture, and color of his artworks, that is, as ink on paper, paint on canvas, or cast bronze. For Johns, the artistic process was an integral aspect of the work of art itself. By deemphasizing the hand of the artist, his method also represented an unequivocal repudiation of the individualized self-expression and emotional intensity of the Abstract Expressionists.",
