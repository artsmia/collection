  "text": "The role that mathematics and machines played in the design process for Barbara Brown is well represented in <I>Precision</I>.  Brown's carefully calculated line placement creates a shading effect on the large white rectangles in the pattern, giving the viewer the feeling they are looking at the elevation of three-dimensional cylinders.  The juxtaposition of geometric shapes, such as circles and rectangles, further add to the mathematic aspect of this textile.  With the cylinders seemingly stamping out piles of white circular pieces, this design strongly alludes to an assembly line, where technical perfection and repetition reign.",
