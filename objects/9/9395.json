  "text": "While this object was made in America in the mid 19th century, its design is inspired by Toby jugs that had been created in England since the late 18th century.  The original idea of a Toby jug might have come from the character Uncle Toby in <I>Tristam Shandy</I>, published in England in 1760, or a popular song entitled The Little Brown Jug, written in 1761 and dedicated to a Toby Philpot.",
