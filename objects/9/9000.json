  "text": "Ceremonial paddles are among the best known examples of Austral Islands art. Although their original purpose is not clear, they were likely used as dance wands. In the early nineteenth century, many were made as souvenirs for European travelers. It is unclear whether this particular paddle was used locally or made for the market nearly 200 years ago.\r\n\r\nThe geometric design of interlocking lozenges arranged in bands on the paddle was carved with a shark's tooth. A circle of bottle-horned beast heads, carved in full relief, decorates the pommel.",
