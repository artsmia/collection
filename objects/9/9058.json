  "text": "This moonlit view of a river is from one of Hiroshige's famous landscape series. A different edition without mountains in the background is also known. As deletion of compositional elements in a design typically suggests a later edition, this print, which includes mountains in the background, is regarded as an earlier edition. The later edition, however, features a blue gradation encircling the moon-an element missing in this version. Such a specialized and labor-intensive addition is highly unusual in the later edition. Therefore, it is possible that the two editions were produced around the same time.",
