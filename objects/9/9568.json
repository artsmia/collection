  "text": "This fake caricature ascribed to the 18th-century Roman artist Pier Leone Ghezzi was part of a portfolio of 150 forged drawings that came on the market in Milan in the 1940s. The fake Ghezzi sheets are now scattered across museum collections in Europe and America. To explain the stylistic inconsistences compared to autograph caricatures by the artist, the drawings were said to be executed in his youth (always a warning sign).",
