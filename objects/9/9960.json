  "text": "Carlo Bugatti's curvilinear designs were often decorated with stylized flora and bird motifs and luxurious materials, resonating with both Islamic taste and the Art Nouveau style.  In 1902, Bugatti achieved acclaim at the World's Fair in Turin for the four rooms that he designed, one of which contained this screen.  While Bugatti's engaging designs were not necessarily practical, his work influenced the development of modernist design in the 19th and early 20th centuries.",
