  "text": "Sturdily constructed and versatile, recessed-leg stools with splayed legs are one of the basic categories of Ming period seating furniture.  Although pictorial sources show that stools were the most frequently used seats, especially for women, they have not survived in great numbers. Within the hierarchy of seating furniture, stools occupied a relatively low position and social status was reflected in who used the tall armchairs versus those who sat on side chairs, stools or benches. Stools were considered comfortable however, and they were produced in hundreds of configurations that ranged from rather small, simple frames to larger, ornately carved versions.",
