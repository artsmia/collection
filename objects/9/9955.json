  "text": "Textile designers face a number of challenges in order to create a successful fabric design. One of the most basic considerations is the development of a pattern that can be repeated without being boring or forming an obvious \"beginning\" and \"end\" of the elemental motif.<P> \r\nWhen using cloth for fashion or interiors it is often useful to identify the \"pattern repeat\" in order to maximize the effect of the textile. This piece and the panels to the left and right, contain slightly more than two full repeats of the primary design. As you look for pattern repeats remember that none of them are defined by a straight line.\r\n",
