  "description": "a winter scene, with hunters and foresters warming their hands at a log-fire outside a mountain hut covered with snow; the flame of the fire is the center of the color scheme and lights up the bright colors of the figures around it, the tones intensified by the contrasting areas of shadow beyond and the foreground snow; the blue sky shades down to grey; one of the set 'Hyakunin Isshu Ubaga Etoki', with a poem by Minamoto in the square cartouche adjoining the title cartouche 'Friends are gone from me, the grass and leaves are withered. Ah! how remembrance makes winter-time more lonely here in this mountain hamlet.'",
