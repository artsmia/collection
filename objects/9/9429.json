  "text": "This armchair and seven similar examples were given to the Institute by Carolyn and Franklin Groves and The Groves Foundation as furnishings for the Grand Salon from the Hôtel Gaillard de La Bouëxière.  The 1738 and 1759 inventories for the grand salon reveal that the room was predominantly furnished with nine armchairs upholstered in Gobelins tapestry with scenes of fabled animals, similar to the upholstery on view here.  The armchairs will be installed in the Grand Salon following restoration of their upholstery.   \r\n\r\nThe sinuous C- and S-curve shapes of the chair's arms and legs, juxtaposed by shells, scrolls, and cabochon motifs, reflects a restrained version of the rococo style that was popular in France during the mid-eighteenth century.",
