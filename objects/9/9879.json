  "text": "This shallow, conical bowl has an elegantly curled rim and a rich rust-colored glaze that thins to reveal a subtle brown underglaze. Best known during Northern Song for their celadon-glazed stoneware, the Yaozhou kilns in Shanxi province also produced black and russet-glazed vessels like this one. These so-called persimmon glazed wares were fired at temperatures slightly higher than the celadons resulting in pieces that are hard and resonant.\r\n<P>A vessel like this demonstrates that while famous for its celadon, the Yaozhou kilns also tried to capture some of the developing Song market in brown ware.\r\n",
