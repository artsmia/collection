  "text": "This shallow, conical bowl has an elegantly curled rim and a rich rust-colored glaze that thins to reveal a subtle brown underglaze. Best known during Northern Song for their celadon-glazed stoneware, the Yaozhou kilns in Shanxi province also produced black and russet-glazed vessels like this one. These so-called persimmon glazed wares were fired at temperatures slightly higher than the celadons resulting in pieces that are hard and resonant.\r\nA vessel like this demonstrates that while famous for its celadon, the Yaozhou kilns also tried to capture some of the developing Song market in brown ware.",
