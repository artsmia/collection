  "text": "This handsome storage cabinet is constructed entirely in huang-hua-li hardwood including its back and top panels. Only the interior shelves are of soft wood. The upper section of the cabinet, with its latticework doors, was most likely used to display precious objects. Called \"confounding the cat cabinets\" by some Chinese, it served the dual purpose of protecting display pieces while concealing more mundanestored items from view. Versatile cabinets such as this functioned equally well in scholar's libraries, the women's quarters, and public spaces within upper-class Chinese homes.",
