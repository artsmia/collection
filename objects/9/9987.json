  "text": "The concept of seasonal changes marking the patterns of our lives is a popular subject for artists. The leafless trees, a harvest moon, and the use of color communicate very specific information without a single word being used.\r\nSome of the dramatic screen prints of the 1960s and 70s create bold statements that can be used as wall art. Prints such as this one can be displayed in a broad horizontal format and used to dominate the rooms in which they are installed.",
