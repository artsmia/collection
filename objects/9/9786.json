  "text": "This round tzu-t'an tube with its screw-on fu-dog top could have been used to store exotic incense sticks, a favorite writing brush, special chopsticks, or more likely cricket-tickling sticks. Unfortunately, the long, carefully inlaid inscription provides no clue as to the container's exact purpose. It reads in part:\r\n\r\nIn the distance is a misty grove -- viewing the spring colors in Chiang-nan\r\nEverything here is worth remembering.\r\nThe sorrows of rivers and mountains have not been thoroughly tasted...\r\nIn the sunset under the willow trees, in whose courtyard am I in tying up the      horse's reigns'\r\n\r\nIt is signed Tsun-chiang mo-ku (in imitation of the ancient) with a cyclical date of keng-hsu corresponding to either 1670 or 1730. While very few inlayers of wood are recorded, silver-wire inlay is a characteristically Chinese art practice. This exquisitely crafted tube is a rare signed and dated literati object, however, and is thought to be unique.",
