  "text": "The Rokugo_ River separates Edo from the neighboring town of Kawasaki to the southwest. After a flood destroyed a bridge, travelers along the Tokaido road used ferries to cross the river. Kawasaki was a popular destination for Edo residents who hoped to escape the hectic pace of the city, if only for a daylong excursion to visit the town's picturesque temple (shown here on the distant shore). This diptych probably illustrates such a group of picnickers. Kiyonaga infused his compositions with a greater sense of verisimilitude by lowering the viewer's vantage point, and by skillfully rendering his tall, elegant figures in such a way as to suggest movement and interaction.",
