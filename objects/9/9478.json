  "text": "A pioneer in the contemporary fiber art movement, Evelyn Svec Ward was celebrated for her abstract textile work informed by the history and materials of traditional Mexican handicrafts. In this late example from her Oaxaca series, Ward combines organic and inorganic materials such as clay beads, ixtle fibers (from agave plants), and amate bark paper in an abstract assemblage that emphasizes the inherent natural qualities of each component. Commenting on her work, Ward said: “With a needle as my tool, and materials such as linen, cotton, or various bast fibers, I feel completely free to work in many directions, and I see unlimited possibilities for expression.”",
