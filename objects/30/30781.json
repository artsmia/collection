  "text": "The highly polished surface of this seated, meditative figure is a metaphor for his absolute purity.  He is a Jina, or <i>Tirthankara</I>, a liberated being whose renunciation of passion and anger is intended to guide other individuals towards a life of nonviolence and respect for all living things. Devotees can choose to either remain in everyday life, or to practice austerities to free the soul from bondage. The Sanskrit inscription on the cushion names the patron of the sculpture and gives the date of its dedication to the Jain temple.",
