  "text": "Here we see magpies squabbling on a branch. The “three joys” mentioned in the title refers both to the three large fruits, probably a species of pomegranate, and to passing the three imperial examinations within China’s government bureaucracy.\r\n\r\nKumashiro Yūhi emulated the style of Shen Quan, a Chinese academic painter who specialized in bird-and-flower subjects and who visited Nagasaki, Japan, from 1731 to 1733. This style combined traditional decorative compositions with elements of Western realism, including chiaroscuro, the contrast of light and dark in visual art. Yūhi championed Shen’s style in Japan and became the earliest proponent of the Nagasaki school, which specialized in such bird-and-flower paintings. \r\n  \r\n\r\n",
