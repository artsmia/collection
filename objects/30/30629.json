  "text": "Toward the end of the 16th century, the fashionable wives of Japan's military elite began to wear unbelted robes, known as <I>uchikake</I>, over their regular robes during the autumn and winter months. As the outermost garment, <I>uchikake</I> were lavishly decorated and the hem was padded, thus adding the weight necessary to keep it from slipping off the shoulders. In the Edo period, <I>uchikake</I> were worn by wealthy women of all classes, and they became a standard part of the wedding ensemble. This example features an overall pattern of blossoming tree peonies, rendered in stencil resist, embroidery, and gold couching.",
