  "text": "The central figure in this photograph is a Hmong shaman at a home in Frogtown, St. Paul, performing a ceremony with no need for special dress, as his ceremonies are incorporated into the Hmong people's everyday lives and needs. The following text accompanies this photo from Wing Young Huie's published Frogtown photographs:\r\n\r\nIn Hmong culture we believe that sometimes our good spirits have become lost. That's why people get sick. It is the shaman that calls the spirit back. … During the ceremony the shaman calls the Magic power. When it comes, the shaman and the power will start shaking and chanting. The shaman gives the Magic power instructions on what to do. It's just like giving a computer instructions.",
