  "text": "John Costigan took few formal art lessons, but enjoyed the company of friends in sketch clubs where he learned how to draw and paint from the figure by working from life models. The son of Irish immigrants and orphaned as a teenager, he valued his family very much. Most of his work, like this watercolor, features family on or near his farm in Orangeburg, NY, enjoying the outdoors together.",
