  "text": "T. Lux Feininger studied photography and painting at the Bauhaus art and design school in Dessau, Germany, starting in 1926. He also participated in the Bauhaus student jazz band, three members of which are shown here. Feininger produced several photographs documenting the band as well as the experimental theater productions of Bauhaus students. These images provide a window into the creative, experimental, humorously antic world the artist would have known during his time at the Bauhaus, a school that became recognized for incorporating fine arts, craft, and technology in its pragmatic approach to design.",
