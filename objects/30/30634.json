  "text": "This ketubah, or marriage contract, was made for a wedding that took place in Isfahan, Persia (today's Iran) on April 4, 1879 (11 Nisan, 5639 on the Jewish calendar.) The bride was Bruriah, daughter of Joseph, and the groom was Moshe, son of Joseph. The lion and sun are ancient Persian symbols dating back to the Sassanian Period (226-651 BCE) and are often seen on 19th and 20th century marriage contracts in Isfahan. The marriage contract sets forth the bride's rights within the marriage and the terms of her support in case of divorce.",
