  "text": "The earliest catalogue of studio and garden stones, Du Wan's \"Stone Catalogue of the Cloudy Forest\" (early 12th century) discussed the large convoluted Lake Tai limestone rocks used in gardens as well as Ling-pi stones for the scholar's table.\r\nLing bi (Numinous Cliff) rock is a dark, hard, highly resonant stone found in Anhui province. This region was also famous during Ming and Qing for the production of fine inkstones, inksticks and hand made paper used by the scholar class. This rock reveals in its jagged contours, caused by centuries of water erosion, the dramatic natural effects treasured by collectors.\r\nThis is a good example of a \"one-sided\" rock; the back is nearly flat while the front is deeply furrowed with interesting formations.",
