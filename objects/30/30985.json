  "text": "The Zhejiang artist Zhu Sheng is best known for his paintings of orchids, bamboo and rocks. He contributed the bamboo designs in the 1701 version of the influential painting manual The Mustard Seed Garden (Jie Zi Yuan Hua Zhuan) This set of four hanging scrolls is similar to several other relatively large-size, atmospheric depictions of wet and dry bamboo and rocks by Zhu. Some of these are multiple scrolls forming a continuous composition or, as in this example, similar paintings identical in size that can be displayed individually in pairs or as a group.",
