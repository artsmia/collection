  "text": "The tall, dramatic mountains and pine trees rendered here by Zou Zhilin create the perfect secluded setting for a scholar wishing to retreat from society.\r\n\r\nThe inscribed poem adds to the scene’s evocativeness: \r\n\r\n<I>The cold water in the pool gives birth to the moon\r\nThe wind blowing among pine trees in the night is reminiscent of autumn\r\nPainted in the fifth moon in the summer of 1647.</I>",
