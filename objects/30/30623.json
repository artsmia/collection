  "text": "Lin Xue, also called Lin Tiansu, was a courtesan born in Fujian province, who resided most of her life at West Lake in Hangzhou. She was well-educated in the classics and familiar with antique paintings which she studied and copied. She exchanged poetry with the well-known literatus Li Liufang (1575-1629) and corresponded with the pre-eminent painter and critic of her day, Dong Qichang (1555-1636).\r\nLin Xue was well-versed in the \"orthodox lineage\" of the Four Wangs and Dong Qichang and, like those artists, she occasionally cited Huang  Gongwang (1269-1354) as a source of inspiration in her work. Indeed, this handscroll displays delicate \"dragged\" brush strokes and compositional elements that reference the techniques and attitudes of the fourteenth century masters. The painting has five attached colophons attesting to the respect Lin Xue apparently held in Hangzhou literati circles.",
