  "text": "These delicate flower studies were painted by Mianyi, a grandson of Emperor Qianlong (reigned 1735–95). Like most of the educated elite, Mianyi was well-versed in classical literature, music, and calligraphy, but he excelled at painting—especially flowers. The use of color (as opposed to black ink), descriptive detail, and deceptively simple appearance are typical of Chinese court painting in the 1700s—quite different from the more cerebral ink landscapes of the literati tradition.\r\n\r\nThese four double leaves originally formed an album in the imperial collection. In fact the frontispiece bears the seal of the Chia-ching emperor, who reigned from 1796 to 1821.",
