  "text": "The 16 paintings in this album each depict one of the “Sixteen Arhats” of Buddhism and scenes relating to their lives. Arhats were enlightened disciples of Buddha and acted as protectors of the Buddhist law. Some of them here are identified by name, while others remain a mystery. This album was signed with Ding Yunpeng’s name, but it was probably created by one of his followers, perhaps during the 1800s. Although the album is not a genuine work of Ding Yunpeng, the arhats exhibit exaggerated features typical of his style.",
