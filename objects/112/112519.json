  "text": "The world is increasingly unstable. International relationships change quickly and sometimes unpredictably. In this suite of prints, one configuration shows the world much as we would expect to see it on a Mercator map, except that it has been jiggled and everything is somewhat out of alignment. In the other three images, the countries are more radically displaced. Dislocated from their usual contexts, some of the countries become nearly unrecognizable. The impenetrable silhouettes invite questions about the implications of shifting interests, power, alliances, and enmity.",
