  "text": "The Brazilian Campana Brothers are among the foremost designers active today. Many of their works feature aspects of Baroque design informed by the visual culture of their native Brazil. The <i>Aleijadinho Candlestick</i> is part of their <i>Brazilian Baroque Collection</i>, created in collaboration with local craftsmen during several visits to Rome, in 2011. The title pays homage to the famous protagonist of late 18th century Brazilian Baroque architecture and sculpture, Antonio Francisco Lisboa, better known as <i>o Aleijadinho</i> or little cripple. The Campana Brothers' practice of taking casts of small, often everyday objects, and fusing them together to form small personal collections, may be interpreted as a reference to Latin and African American traditions of applying small found objects to the surface of decorative arts objects as a memorial gesture.",
