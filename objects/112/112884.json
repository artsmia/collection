  "text": "A prominent member of Berlin Dada and the Neue Sachlichkeit (New Objectivity) movements, George Grosz emigrated from Germany with his family in 1933 and settled in New York City, having barely escaped from military authorities of the newly installed Nazi regime who considered him an enemy of the state for his radical anti-fascist activities. Though he continued to incorporate political content in his work during the 1930s, he increasingly focused on landscape and urban views in his new homeland, as seen in this abstracted interpretation of the Manhattan skyline.",
