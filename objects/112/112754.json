  "text": "This painting depicts the Daoist deity Zhenwu, or the Perfected Warrior, and his realm. Zhenwu is seen at the top of the painting mounted on a mythical beast called a qilin, flying through celestial clouds. He has three eyes and a sword pointed downward. Below are other Daoist deities, attendants, and guardian figures, along with a second depiction of Zhenwu in the center, standing on a tortoise entwined with a snake. Zhenwu emerged as a Daoist deity in the early Northern Song (960-1126) and reached the peak of his popularity during the Ming dynasty (1368-1644). Prior to this time, he was known as Xuanwu, the Dark Warrior, and appeared as a tortoise entwined with a snake in the art of the Han dynasty (206 BCE â€“ 220 CE). Fervent Yuan and Ming imperial patronage of the god's legendary home, Mount Wudang, gives evidence of Zhenwu's emergence as an important deity with a cadre of assistant martial divinities. In the late imperial period, the Perfected Warrior was worshiped as a guardian god, particularly as a protector of the state and imperial family.",
