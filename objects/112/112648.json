  "text": "So Far from God humanizes the contentious political issue of border crossing, capturing the desperation, determination, and resilience of these hopeful immigrants. Jimenez's expressive figures and montage-like narrative reflect his affinity for early twentieth century Mexican murals by Orozco, Rivera, and Siquieros, while the jagged edges from his broken lithography stone echo the rugged quality of Jose Guadalupe Posada's late nineteenth century political cartoons. The title refers to a quote by Mexican president Porfirio Díaz (1876–1911). Regarding Mexico's depressed economy, Díaz remarked, ¡Pobre México! ¡Tan lejos de Dios y tan cerca de los Estados Unidos! (Poor Mexico! So far from God and so close to the United States!)  Forever suspended in a torturous purgatory, Jimenez's immigrants are so close to paradise, yet so far from salvation.",
