  "text": "Ric Gendron (pronounced John-Dro) is a noted contemporary Native American painter and printmaker. He was born and raised near Spokane, Washington, and is a member of the Colville and Umatilla tribes. Gendron's work often features traditional images and dances blended with American rock and pop culture or American blues and jazz music. He also addresses the hardships suffered by Native Americans through cultural assimilation, such as the once widespread practice of children being removed from their homes and sent to boarding schools, where they were forced to reject their native languages and religious practices and learn English and Euro-American culture. \"Throughout history, the United States government and the churches have tried to mold Indian people to fit their own ways and beliefs through germ warfare, genocide, relocation, and destruction of traditional hunting, fishing and gathering places, yet the Indian people remain strong,\" Gendron said. In this portrait of a young Native American man, Gendron depicts the sitter in what appears to be modern clothing and sporting sunglasses and a prominent earring, taking on the guise of a hipster or rock star. The work's title, Rattle, is ambiguous in this context, referring to an object common to Native American ceremonies and military societies.",
