  "text": "Jaune Quick-To-See Smith is an acclaimed contemporary Native American artist who works in a variety of media. Her work explores important themes of Native American culture like assimilation, tradition, stereotypes, and interactions of contemporary Native Americans in today’s world. The central figure of this work is an anonymous Native American male who wears a bandolier bag, traditional-style choker and necklace, decorated leggings, and a frockcoat. The blood coming out of the figure’s left hand references the colors of the American flag.  Considering that Native Americans volunteer for military service during wartime at a higher rate than any other group per capita, Quick-to-See Smith asks, “Who is an American'”",
