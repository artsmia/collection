  "text": "Painted plein air (directly from nature), this watercolor features one of Reginal Marsh's favorite perspectives on the burgeoning Manhattan skyline, the view from the East River waterfront in the borough of Brooklyn. Despite his interest in the growing modern metropolis, Marsh rejected the formal innovations of modern art, instead embracing long-standing artistic tradtions anchored in the great masters of the Italian Renaissance and Baroque. Indeed, his subjects--mostly figurative scenes of New York's lower and working classes--align him with the Social Realists, a loosely-knit group of activist American artists who used their art as a tool for social and political change.",
