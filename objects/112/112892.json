  "text": "Painted out of doors at the site depicted, Reginald Marsh’s watercolor depicts his favorite city (New York) from just below his favorite bridge (the Brooklyn Bridge). From a vantage point at the edge of the East River he captures the energy of the thriving and growing Manhattan skyline. Marsh adored this modern metropolis. He adopted the techniques of Italian Renaissance and Baroque painting and used them to depict the working class and unhoused of the city. Marsh aligned himself with other artists using their art to foster social and political change.",
