  "text": "Artist commentary: To cross the river people blew up plastic bags or made bamboo rafts. Those that had money hired Thai boaters to take them across. After already receiving the payments, the boaters dump the boats in the middle of the river killing everyone while he swam to shore. Once across some of the people were forced by the Thai police to turn back to Laos.",
