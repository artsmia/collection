  "text": "When Larsen was commissioned to design the stage curtain for the Wolf Trap Theater in Virginia, the company worked with Coral Stephens, head of a handweaving studio in Swaziland. The Swazi weavers had already produced a series of casement fabrics for the Larsen line and used handspun mohair yarns. In 1971 the cloth was the largest Swazi export.",
