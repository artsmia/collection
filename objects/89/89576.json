  "text": "Artist commentary: <I>The “Secret War” lasted 15 years. The Hmong had an army of 30, 000 soldiers to fight for America. Clan rivalry also sent a quarter of the Hmong population to the Communist side. Towards the end of the war many of the Hmong soldiers were as young as 11 years old because most of the grown men had died.</I>",
