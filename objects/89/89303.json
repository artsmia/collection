  "text": "An eccentric Buddhist priest who lived in China during the 9th century, Putai (Hotei, in Japanese) was usually portrayed as a happy wanderer unconcerned with social conventions or material wealth. He is said to have carried his meager belongings around in a large sack. As such, he became a favorite subject for Zen ink painters, who saw him as the personification of non-attachment. Here the Zen priest Kogan  playfully depicted him taking shelter in the confines of his sack.",
