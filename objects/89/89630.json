  "inscription": "At edge: [3] (third piece of the series); {Meiji jūkyunen gogatsu nijūichinichi} (censored on May 21 1868); \r\nIn the reign of Emperor Saga, Kūkai had been requested to inscribe a signboard for the Daigokuden. Ono no Tōfū says this and noted that the charater \\\"dai\\\" looked like the character \\\"ka\\\" (fire), so that the meaning was changed to \\\"Court of Consuming Fire\\\"; he laughed, wondering what this might bode for the future. Sure enough, on the April 24th, 1177, fire broke out in Higuchijima Kōji, and the flames spread to the Eight Ministries, the Daigokuden and to the gate of Blue Dragon and White Tiger, reducing all to ashes. \r\nby Saitō Fūrai",
