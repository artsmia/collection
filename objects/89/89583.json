  "text": "Artist commentary: The Hmong people were no longer safe in Laos, now that the communists took over. Trying to elude the communist soldiers many people spent anywhere from several months in the jungle to a year before ever reaching the Mekong River. Food would run out, so people had to eat whatever they could find. People ate roots, barks, and leaves. Many people died from starvation.",
