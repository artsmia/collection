  "text": "Artist commentary: <I>The French treated the Hmong poorly and collected heavy taxes, while giving local control to the Laotians. Due to this harsh and unfair treatment, the Hmong rebelled. The French, in their arrogance, couldn’t understand why the Hmong rebelled. They called rebellion “The Mad Man’s War.”</I>",
