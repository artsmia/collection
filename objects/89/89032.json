  "text": "The wonder fabric of the 1960s was nylon knit; it was easy to wash, resisted wrinkling and therefore required little or no ironing and traveled easily. It was not beloved by all consumers, however, so the Ja-eL line sometimes used other fabrics.  Although not as easy to clean, wool jersey draped well and was easy to care for and therefore was used for some production.  \r\n\r\nCastanet was marketed in six different colorways, but was discontinued with the demise of Ja-el production.  Minaret and Firebird, renamed Ballet Ruse, were printed on a woven rather than a knit ground cloth and were included in the Larsen interiors line during the late 1960 and into the 70s.",
