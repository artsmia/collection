  "text": "Most kids aren’t naturally neat. With the brightly colored balls of their “Hang-It-All” organizer, Charles and Ray Eames tried to make tidiness fun, helping to usher in a new era of colorful children’s furniture and accessories. The design by the husband-and-wife team resembles the abstract sculpture of the period, as well as the structure of atoms, which influenced popular culture and design in the post-World War II (1939–45) era.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOnly a few thousand “Hang-It-Alls” were made before Tigrett Enterprises went out of business, but the Herman Miller Furniture Company reissued the product in the 1990s.",
