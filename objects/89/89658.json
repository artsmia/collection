  "text": "This bottle has two chambers in the form of stylized potatoes, a staple of the Andean diet for at least 8000 years. In Quechua, the language of the Inka, kawsay or \"food for all\" is the word for potato, referencing its essential function as a source of nourishment for the vast Inka Empire. Each chamber is topped with a spout; a bridge connects the two. When the bottle was tipped to force liquid back and forth between the chambers, an intentional whistling sound was produced.",
