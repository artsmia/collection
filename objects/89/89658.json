  "text": "This bottle has two chambers in the form of stylized potatoes, a staple of the Andean diet for at least 8000 years. In Quechua, the language of the Inka, <I>kawsay</I> or food for all is the word for potato, referencing its essential function as a source of nourishment for the vast Inka Empire. Each chamber is topped with a spout; a bridge connects the two. When the bottle was tipped to force liquid back and forth between the chambers, an intentional whistling sound was produced.",
