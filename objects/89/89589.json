  "text": "Artist commentary: We spent a lot of time waiting. Every other day we waited for the UN ration truck to deliver food. At night we waited for the water pump to open so we can fetch water for cooking and bathing. Some people waited for their names to appear on the list to come to America. Others are still waiting for Laos to get better so they can go back home. Some just simply wait because that’s all they know.",
