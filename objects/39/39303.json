  "text": "Wing Young Huie spent two years photographing Frogtown, a neighborhood in St. Paul, Minnesota. He was especially drawn to its increasingly diverse population of Asian, Black, and white residents. Huie developed a project that through photographs and interviews would address “the myriad realities that coexist in Frogtown, ” an area that became “like a second home” to him. Here he offers a glimpse of one of Frogtown’s barbershops, one of the many businesses that welcomed him during his time in the neighborhood.",
