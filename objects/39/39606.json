  "text": "Korean potters adopted various scrolling floral designs from imported Chinese ceramics, but the origins of such patterns can be traced to Central Asia, India, Persia, and as far away as Greece and Egypt. Goryeo celadons with scrolling patterns in iron oxide, such as this one, are prized for the exuberant, painterly quality of their brushwork.",
