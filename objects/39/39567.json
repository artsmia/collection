  "text": "Martin Royalton Kisch identified this drawing, long attributed to Antonie van Borssom, as a copy of one by Aert de Gelder in the British Museum (1860, 0616.129). De Gelder, Rembrandt’s final student and long-lived acolyte carried his master’s style forward into the 18th century. Royalton Kish dates the original drawing as 1670-1700. It is difficult to date the drawing offered here. Close copies have been made of Rembrandt and Rembrandt-school drawings ever since the 17th century, but the present one is on hand-made laid paper consistent with 17th and 18th century usage.",
