  "text": "People in straw raincoats and carrying umbrellas tread carefully along the steep incline as drizzle falls across Shōhei Bridge. Hiroshige represented the trajectory of the rain with thin, pale gray diagonal lines running across the print. The relatively light color and wider intervals between lines suggest that the rainfall is gentle.\r\nJapan experiences frequent rain during the summer, and the Japanese language has many words for rain. Late spring to early summer rain is called tsuyu (plum rain), samidare (fifth-month rain), or baku-u (wheat rain).",
