  "text": "From the mid-17th through the mid-19th centuries many women wore pairs of pockets tied to their waist under their skirts and petticoats. The pockets were accessible through slits left open in their outer clothing and were used to carry such things as keys, handkerchiefs or small purses. During the 18th century it was quite fashionable for the pockets to be embroidered, while the pockets of the 19th century were quite plain.\r\nThese particular pockets are quite rare as they were specifically embroidered for this purpose, whereas most decorated pieces that have survived seem to have been cut from worn out embroidery such as bedspreads.",
