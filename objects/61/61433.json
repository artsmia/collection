  "text": "Although lions are not native to China, the Japanese have long referred to them as karajishi, or Chinese lions, because the first lion images seen in Japan came from China in the 9th century. This print’s subject alludes to a well-known Chinese proverb about a lioness testing the strength and stamina of her cubs by pushing them off a cliff. She accepts only those able to climb back up the rocky precipice. In some versions, the lioness conducts this terrible test when the cubs are only three days old. The first line of the accompanying poem probably refers to cubs that survived into their fourth day.\r\n\r\nThe four-day-old Chinese lion although just a little cub,\r\nis as graceful as a peony flower.",
