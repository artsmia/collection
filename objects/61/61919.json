  "text": "Painted with two lush peony blooms in the center, this exceptional example of early Ming blue-and-white is notable for its bold design, softness of brushwork, and subtle, controlled shading. The work exhibits the saturated heaped and piled spots of intense, cobalt-blue found in the best Yongle era (1403-24) porcelains.\r\n<P>The central blossoms are encircled in the cavetto by an elaborate lotus scroll of eight blooms, and the flared flat-lipped rim with eight detached flower and fruit sprays including chrysanthemum, pomegranate, and camillias among others.\r\n<P>An identical dish was excavated from the early Yongle stratum at the Chung Hua Road site at the Ming Imperial Factory at Jingdezhen.",
