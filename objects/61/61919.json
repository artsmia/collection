  "text": "Painted with two lush peony blooms in the center, this exceptional example of early Ming blue-and-white is notable for its bold design, softness of brushwork, and subtle, controlled shading. The work exhibits the saturated \"heaped and piled\" spots of intense, cobalt-blue found in the best Yongle era (1403-24) porcelains.\r\nThe central blossoms are encircled in the cavetto by an elaborate lotus scroll of eight blooms, and the flared flat-lipped rim with eight detached flower and fruit sprays including chrysanthemum, pomegranate, and camillias among others.\r\nAn identical dish was excavated from the early Yongle stratum at the Chung Hua Road site at the Ming Imperial Factory at Jingdezhen.",
