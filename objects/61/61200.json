  "text": "Horikiri Iris Garden still exists in Tokyo. According to legend, a local farmer who was fond of irises planted part of his land with as many varieties as he could acquire. By the early 19th century, the area had been converted into a public garden. Located on the outskirts of Edo, it became popular among city residents as a destination for early summer excursions. Here, visitors are shown enjoying the garden at its peak.\r\nHiroshige exploited the vertical format by placing several tall, graceful irises in the foreground. He made the visitors small in scale so that seen through the irises they appear convincingly far away.",
