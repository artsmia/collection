  "text": "Although he began working with wood in the 1950s, Hogbin did not start turning wood until 1971, when he left his teaching position to become an independent craftsman. Author of one of the first and most influential texts on turned wood as sculpture, Wood Turning: The Purpose of the Object (1980), Hogbin was one of the first wood turning artists to deconstruct lathe-turned forms such as the chair shown in Gallery 275. \r\n\r\nConcentric bowl demonstrates Hogbin's playful and experimental approach to woodturning. The bowl takes its name from the concentric circles that the sliced apart sections of the turned bowl create when reassembled at an angle. The orange pigment on the interior of the bowl emphasizes the segmented nature of the vessel. Hogbin first used color to enliven his wood objects in the early 1980s and, along with Giles Gilson, was one of the first wood artists to do so.",
