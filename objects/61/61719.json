  "text": "Ceramic pillows were produced over several centuries throughout China, but the northern Cizhou kilns supplied a volume and variety greater than all others. In addition to the predominant black and white designs, were Cizhou pillows decorated with colorful lead-silicate glazes in a technique that first flourished in the eighth century during the Tang dynasty. Called <I>sancai</I> or three-color ware, this technique usually combined green and yellow glazes on a cream slip to produce a three color effect.\r\n\r\n<P>The d√©cor of this quadrangular pillow is clearly articulated with a finely carved white lotus blossom surrounded by large stylized green leaves against a black ground. On the bottom, is a rare twenty-three character brushed ink inscription dating the piece to the first year of the emperor Ming Zhang's reign in the twelfth month of year <I>gengwu.</I> This accords with 1190 CE of the Jin dynasty. The name Liu Zhongyi also appears along with a partially obscured honorific title. Self-dated ceramics are extremely rare and this inscription points to the importance such works held for the well-furnished tomb.",
