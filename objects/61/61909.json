  "text": "Hoyer  turns objects using green wood from the Arizona desert. In this untitled work from Hoyer's \"Gourd Series,\" the artist exploits the natural irregularities of wood, turning a vessel from a vertical section of a hollow log. Hoyer manipulates the wood section to achieve a vessel with two open sides. One side has a symmetrical, oblong opening with a natural bark edge, while the other side has two large, frail-looking openings. Hoyer describes these works as \"based on the vessel form, aged and weathered by time and the elements. Within is the sphere, the soul of the vessel, unchanged in the purity of the geometric form. As my body has aged with time, the search still continues within for the purity and perfection of that which is whole and does not change.\"",
