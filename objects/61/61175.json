  "text": "Snowflakes dot the dark blue sky above Kinryūzan temple. Hiroshige placed the viewer just outside the gate, under the massive hanging lantern. To give texture to the snow on white areas, the printer used a blank woodblock to emboss small spots across the temple structure and trees. The accumulation of snow has not stopped visitors from coming, many carrying umbrellas or wearing straw hats. The hanging lantern was presented as an offering by the roof artisans of the red and green entrance gate, a glimpse of which is seen at left.",
