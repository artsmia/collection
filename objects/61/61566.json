  "text": "The first commercially successful typewriter was invented in 1878; within 10 years it had become an indispensable fixture of business life. Fit for purpose, its overall appearance changed little until the middle of the 1900s and the appearance of the Super G, a collaboration between Smith Corona, amaker of typewriters in the United States and other office machines and Carrozzeria Ghia, the Italian firm famous for designing stylish and sporty cars for Volkswagen, Alfa Romeo, and Ford.  With its racing stripes, sleek lines, and bright colors, the Super G was more than a typewriter; it was an object of desire for the home.",
