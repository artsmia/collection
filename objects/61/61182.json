  "text": "In this autumn scene, a white and reddish fog cuts between Tsukiji Hongan-ji temple and the bay. In the middle ground, some fishermen throw nets into the water while others use rods in hopes of catching fish. Tsukiji Hongan-ji temple was destroyed by a storm in 1856 and rebuilt in 1860; Hiroshige based his depiction of the structure on his imagination and perhaps his memory.\r\nThe gradation in the sky from purple to white to red serves as a device to add color to the print and to abbreviate the sense of distance between the bay and temple.",
