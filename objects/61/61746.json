  "text": "This sumptuously illustrated manuscript featuring silver and gold script on black paper was produced around 1500 for the Karmapa sub-school of the Kagyupa order. The lineage of the Karmapas up to Chodrak Gyatso (1450-1506) appears on the 212th page of this complete 297 page manuscript suggesting that the volume was probably produced during his lifetime at Tsurpu, the main seat of the Karmapas. This version of the <I>Bhadrakalpika Sutra</I> or Sutra of the Auspicious Aeon <I>('phags pa bskal pa bzang po pa)</I>, opens with a magnificent first page in which the title of the text protected by a peacock feather is placed on a lotus and flanked to the left by an image of Sakyamuni Buddha with Amitayus on the right, each in his own shrine.\r\n\r\n<P>The distinctive angular calligraphy is illuminated by scrollwork in raised gold pigment. All of the following pages are illustrated, most on the verso with a pair of miniatures depicting small Buddha images, stupas, mahasiddhas or dharmapalas. With a total of nearly 600 paintings, this is one of the most lavishly illustrated examples of all surviving Tibetan manuscripts.\r\n\r\n<P>Ironically, while the number of illuminated manuscripts began to increase around 1500, the archaistic gold script known as <I>lan-tsha</I> in Tibet became increasingly mannered and difficult to read. Accordingly, some of the most elaborate manuscripts were more worshipped as the embodiment of wisdom than actually read. Commissioning them was always considered a pious act, however, and the book arts remained an important component of Tibetan culture.",
