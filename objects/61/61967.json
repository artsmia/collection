  "text": "As in much of Betty Scarpino's work, this piece is a visual and metaphorical contrast. Scarpino turns wood as a functional plate would be made, then bleaches and paints the grain to create a strong black and white design.  With its sliced form and its own pedestal, Scarpino's plate is \"stepping out of\" its functional role and into sculpture.",
