  "text": "The combination of a bonito with twigs of cherry suggests early summer, when cherry trees begin to fruit and the season’s first bonitos are caught. Both of the poems on this print refer to hatsu-gatsuo (first bonito), the first catch of the season. Traditionally, the Japanese place a high value on hatsu-mono (first foods), the earliest fruits, vegetables, or fish of a particular season. The “first bonito” was the most prized of all and commanded a high price. People anticipated this seasonal delicacy with much excitement, as described in the poems.\r\n\r\nLook at the color of the first bonitos! They are as blue as\r\nmorning glories.\r\nNo wonder they come along to market before the sun rises. \r\n\r\nToshinokado Haruki\r\n\r\nThe first bonito caught on the beach\r\nnear the place called Under Snow melts like snow in my mouth.\r\nHow tasty it is! \r\n\r\nToshiiori Machikado",
