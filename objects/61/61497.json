  "text": "The combination of a bonito with twigs of cherry suggests early summer, when cherry trees begin to fruit and the season’s first bonitos are caught. Both of the poems on this print refer to <I>hatsu-gatsuo</I> (first bonito), the first catch of the season. Traditionally, the Japanese place a high value on <I>hatsu-mono</I> (first foods), the earliest fruits, vegetables, or fish of a particular season. The “first bonito” was the most prized of all and commanded a high price. People anticipated this seasonal delicacy with much excitement, as described in the poems.\r\n\r\n<I>Look at the color of the first bonitos! They are as blue as\r\nmorning glories.\r\nNo wonder they come along to market before the sun rises. </I>\r\n\r\nToshinokado Haruki\r\n\r\n<I>The first bonito caught on the beach\r\nnear the place called Under Snow melts like snow in my mouth.\r\nHow tasty it is! </I>\r\n\r\nToshiiori Machikado",
