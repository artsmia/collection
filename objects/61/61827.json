  "text": "Highly futuristic, Verner Panton’s series of cone chairs resulted from a conscious effort to eliminate any preconceived notions of how a chair should look. Many designers in the 1950s and ’60s proposed alternatives to the traditional four-leg chair, and Panton’s “ice cream cone” solution became a hallmark of his chair designs. Panton also set himself apart from other Scandinavian designers by favoring steel wire and colorful plastics over wood.",
