  "text": "A series of works including <I>Square in Triangle, Tall Double Clem</I> came out of Lønning's desire to reuse the clementine crates she had stockpiled throughout the winter.  Lønning writes, The lure of recycling the crates and creating classic forms has sparked my imagination.  Though primarily a basketmaker, Lønning saw the potential to create geometric forms out of the thin plywood, a more rigid material than her usual rattan, by cutting and recombining the wood from the crates and tying it with waxed linen thread.  She subsequently began purchasing commericial plywood made of a variety of wood species, including the mahogany used for <I>Square in Triangle, Tall Double Clem</I>.  Like many of Lønning's baskets, the wood vessels are double-walled and are inspired by architecture Lønning has experienced on trips to Japan and England.",
