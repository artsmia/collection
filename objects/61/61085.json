  "text": "This print is from a series that resulted from a collaboration between the artists Hiroshige and Kunisada. Hiroshige supplied the landscape scenes, while Kunisada provided the large-scale figures. Here, Hiroshige's view is of Odawara, a town on the Tøkaidø roadway. Kunisada rendered a female traveler fresh from her bath, wearing a cotton yukata, an informal single-layer robe. She is talking to a girl who has come to sell souvenirs. Inexpensive and long-lasting indigo-dye had long been used as a colorant for simple farm clothing in Japan. In the late 19th century, however, indigo was used to create bold patterns such as the large chrysanthemums that adorn this woman's yukata.",
