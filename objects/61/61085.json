  "text": "This print is from a series that resulted from a collaboration between the artists Hiroshige and Kunisada. Hiroshige supplied the landscape scenes, while Kunisada provided the large-scale figures. Here, Hiroshige's view is of Odawara, a town on the Tøkaidø roadway. Kunisada rendered a female traveler fresh from her bath, wearing a cotton yukata, an informal single-layer robe. She is talking to a girl who has come to sell souvenirs.  \r\n\r\nInexpensive and long-lasting indigo-dye had long been used as a colorant for simple farm clothing in Japan. In the late 19th century, however, indigo was used to create bold patterns such as the large chrysanthemums that adorn this woman's yukata. \r\n",
