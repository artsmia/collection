  "text": "The station of Okitsu along the Tōkaidō Roadway is near Tago-no-ura, a site of great natural beauty. Here, Hiroshige shows the town and temple in the distance with fish nets hung to dry in the foreground. Kunisada illustrated a female traveler receiving a massage from a blind masseur. Taga-no-ura was the subject of a poem by Yamabe Akahito, an eighth century courtier who was later lauded as one of Japan's \"Thirty-six Immortal Poets.\" Here, the masseur may be reciting Akahito's poem for the enjoyment of the woman:\r\n\r\nWhen from Tago's coast's\r\nbarrier shadow I emerge,\r\nI am startled by\r\nMount Fuji's lofty peak\r\nClad in newly fallen snow.",
