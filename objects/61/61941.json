  "text": "Mark Lindquist learned woodworking and mechanics from his father Mel Lindquist, who was an acclaimed wood turner moving away from the functional tradition. Mark studied art, art history and photography at New England College in Henniker, New Hampshire and received a Master of Fine Arts from Florida State University. He made radical and lasting changes to the wood turning field in the 1970s and 1980s. Drawn to the creative exploration of flawed wood as revealed by the lathe, Lindquist moved on to create rough, chainsaw-carved sculptures that were the antithesis of the perfect turned bowl. Over the past two decades, he has developed sophisticated robotics to create his pieces. Old Indian Bowl #5 is an excellent example of his early experimentation, where the sculptor would use machines to create ancient-looking vessels.",
