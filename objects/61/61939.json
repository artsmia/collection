  "text": "Stoney Lamar, originally from Louisiana, received a B.S. in woodworking from Appalachian State University in Boone, North Carolina, and continues to work in the Asheville area.  Unlike fellow wood sculptor Robyn Horn, whose piece The Scream is shown in this gallery, Stoney Lamar continues to use the lathe to explore the possibilities of form and texture. He creates movement in his pieces by employing a \"multi-axis\" technique whereby he mounts the wood once, uses the lathe as a carving tool, then remounts the piece in a different position on a different axis and carves again, often repeating the process several times with the same piece.  Running Headlong Into Metal is a quirky self-portrait that shows his imaginative melding of wood and steel along with the artist's self-deprecating humor.",
