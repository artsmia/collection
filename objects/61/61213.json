  "text": "Jñmantsubo (100,00 tsubo or about 8 acres) was a large tract of land along the coast of Susaki, on the outskirts of Edo. In illustrating this rather desolate area from a \"bird's-eye\" view, Hiroshige cleverly depicted an actual bird-an eagle. The print with the darker background (right) is from a later edition, although the deterioration of the woodblocks-discernable through slight discrepancies in registration-is hardly noticeable.",
