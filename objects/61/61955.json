  "text": "While learning to wield a chainsaw from free-form furniture maker and sculptor J.B. Blunk, Mitchell studied pre-Columbian pottery, stone carving, metalwork, and textiles.  Muse #3 seems to echo that interest, but Mitchell's primary inspiration is always his relationship with wood.\r\n\r\n\"Within the graceful bulk of stately trees lies an exquisite palette of patterns and colors waiting to be revealed.  When I cut open one of those jewels of the forest I become a witness to how elemental forces have shaped the life of that tree.  I feel those same forces have somehow inspired my own growth and development as a sculptor.\"",
