  "inscription": "The story is about Ariwara-no Narihira and miyako-dori birds. One evening Narihira and his attendant came over by the Sumida River. It was winter; everthing looked desolate and depressing. The scenery made him miss the city (probably Kyoto) where he used to live and the friends he knew there quite a lot. Then he noticed some pretty white birds flying over the river. He asked the locals what kind of birds they are. He was told they are called \\\"miyako-dori\\\" (city-birds). He found it an interesting coincidence that city-birds flew to him when he was thinking of city.",
