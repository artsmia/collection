  "text": "Slentz, a sculpture professor at Santa Fe Community College, believes that the beauty in his work is derived from the purity and simplicity of form that is emphasized by showing the mark of the tool. He is inspired by the form and features of everyday items such as manhole covers and storm grates, as well as historic items such as shields and primitive tools. He derives a sense of rhythm and movement in the repetitive forms, patterns and textures of these objects, which moves him in a very contemplative, and spiritual way. In his work, he seeks to abstract these ideas in order to provoke the imagination of his viewers. In <I>Duality Doorway</I>, Slentz places the contemplative form of a doorway, suggestive of movement or transcendence, into a circular shape that has been burned and rough cut with a chain saw.",
