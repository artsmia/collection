  "text": "In Islamic Africa, the Qur’anic board is a powerful artifact connected with education and ritual. Its primary purpose is to help students learn Arabic grammar, the Qur’an, and the art of calligraphy. The first nine verses of the third sura (chapter) of the Qur’an are inscribed on one side of the board, while verses from sura 32 are featured on the other side. These boards were also used by Islamic healers, who wrote specific verses on them, washed off and collected the ink, and gave the liquid to supplicants to drink as holy medicine.",
