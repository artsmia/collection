  "text": "Earthenware vessels of the prehistoric Yayoi period are distinguished by their simple and elegant designs that emphasize the shape of the vessel rather than surface decoration. These simple vessels, with their boldly swelling bodies and flaring necks, were coil built but finished on the potter’s wheel, giving them graceful symmetry. The dry clay was then rubbed with a smooth tool before firing, resulting in a smooth, slightly polished surface.",
