  "text": "With the Pottery textile design, Lindberg brings together in a self-referential way the unity of vision of Swedish design in the era after world War II. Attenuated vase, goblet, and cup forms nestle together in repeated rows, punctuated by human figures contemplating and admiring the pottery lineup, as well as disembodied arms seeming to reach for the ceramics. The Pottery textile marked the beginning of Lindberg’s prolific career as a textile designer for the Stockholm department store Nordiska Kompaniet. With its graphically-strong, whimsical, colorful motifs that reveal the artist’s hand, Pottery captures the humor in postwar design—not surprisingly, Lindberg also illustrated children’s books.",
