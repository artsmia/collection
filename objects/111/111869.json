  "text": "Heinrich Kuehn was the most well-known Austrian pictorialist working around the turn of the twentieth century. He produced still lifes, landscapes, and, most frequently, figure studies of his own children, as depicted here. Comfortable in front of their father's camera, they were pliant in their poses, and, in this case, showed a gentle intimacy with one another. This image utilizes the soft-focus effects and low tonalities that were common to pictorialism. While the MIA owns fifteen photogravures by Kuehn, this will be the first gum-bichromate print by him.",
