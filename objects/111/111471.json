  "text": "Carved from a single piece of wood, its massive body supported by an elegant horse, this large drum was closely associated with male identity and authority. Played by men of high ritual standing, it resounded during male initiation ceremonies and the celebration of male ancestors. The horse wears a double necklace with what appear to be Islamic amulets, a possible reference to contact with Muslim traders, who introduced horses to this West African region.",
