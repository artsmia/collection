  "text": "Made of layer upon layer of narrow cloth panels, the Egungun costume entirely covers the dancer, who peers out through a knotted fabric in front. The most prominent color of these masks is red, associated with healing and salvation. The annual Egungun masquerade honors the Yoruba ancestors, and the masked dancer becomes the ancestor, spinning and twirling to send the colorful panels flying out in all directions, giving “breezes of blessings.”",
