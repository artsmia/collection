  "text": "Sartorius’s specialty is spoons that are more decorative than functional. The wood’s natural edge plays a strong role in this large spoon, what he calls a “diet spoon because no one would want to bring that jagged edge to their mouth.”\r\nSustainability also plays a large part in his work. He often takes advantage of other artists’ waste for his small spoons. Sartorius says, “This is the largest of several natural-edge spoons I have made, most being carved from amboyna burl. My source for this beautiful wood was the Portland, Oregon, wood turner Dan Kvitka. I would buy his waste wood after he had bandsawn his turning blank from a large amboyna burl cap.”",
