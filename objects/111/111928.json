  "text": "Jordan turned this lidded box, with its expressively pointed “corner” as the apex of a series of shallow texturing grooves, on an ornamental lathe. Jordan describes the history of the lathe on which this box was turned: “This little box was turned on an ornamental lathe made by J. Evans, probably in 1860. The lathe has been in the Jordan family for generations and some notable pieces have been made on it. In particular the wedding present made for Queen Elizabeth (the Queen Mother) presented by the Worshipful Company of Turners of London. This kind of lathe was made specifically for ivory turning.”",
