  "text": "This Somali wedding basket was given to the bride on her wedding day. It would become a place to store personal items, such as jewelry, but first it would be used for a playful wedding-day ritual. Filled with treats, the basket would be covered and tied shut with string. Male guests, including the groom, would then compete to open it within a certain amount of time. In the end, the groom was expected to winâ€”the tied basket being a metaphor for his wife.",
