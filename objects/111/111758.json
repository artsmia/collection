  "text": "Christoffel Jegher was the most accomplished woodblock cutter in the Netherlands in the 17th century. When Peter Paul Rubens decided to experiment with woodcuts in the 1630s, he, not surprisingly, chose to work with Jegher. Their collaboration led to the creation of nine spectacular woodcut prints–masterpieces that mark one of the highpoints of the woodcut medium. Monumental in scale and design, and majestic and masterful in execution, Hercules Triumphant over Discord exemplifies their collaborative achievement. In an unusual vertical format, the powerful figure of Hercules is shown violently clubbing the vanquished, writhing Hydra, who represents Discord or Envy. Jegher brilliantly exploits the bold, inky quality of the woodcut line to deepen the dynamic tension of the scene, describing the figure of Hercules with extraordinary force—his astounding musculature, taut flesh, veiny arms and ankles, knotty wooden club, and wild expression.",
