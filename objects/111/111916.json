  "text": "Flynn enjoyed adding visual interest to his vessels, and perfecting the double rim was a key to his success. This inner rim, combined with the deep black that highlights its carved surface patterns, provides an especially mysterious effect. Flynn came from a long line of joiners and woodworkers and opened his own woodturning studio in 1988 at the age of 19.",
