  "text": "Kota Ezawa’s <I>The History of Photography Remix</I> presents a personal, aesthetic, and critical interpretation of the medium and its history. Inspired by a class on photography at Stanford University, Ezawa decided to create his own unofficial historical survey in the old-fashioned format of the art-historical slide show. He chose forty photographs from various sources and, through a process combining hand-tracing and computer manipulation, translated them into minimal yet evocative versions of the originals. Ezawa’s remix includes images that are both idiosyncratic and familiar. Some, such as Matthew Brady’s <I>Harvest of Death</I> (1863) and Edward Ruscha’s <I>Parking Lot</I> (1967), are commonly referenced in general art-history surveys. Others are drawn from the popular press, such as the widely circulated photograph of kidnapped newspaper heiress Patty Hearst brandishing a machine gun. Ezawa’s selection suggests the influence of television, film, and photography in shaping collective knowledge and memory. But the last slide, a portrait of the artist himself, points to the subjective nature of history. In the end, Ezawa’s remix might signify a generational shift in which historical narratives have become a “wikireality” to which any one can contribute.",
