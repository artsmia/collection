As the first son of the Grand Dauphin, he was second in line to the throne, yet like his father, he would die of the measles before inheriting the crown. Likewise, Bourgnogne's first two sons died before succeeding to the throne, and it was only his third son, Louis, duc d'Anjou, who would outlive Louis XIV to become France's next king in 1715, Louis XV, at the age of five. Philippe d'Orleans, the duc of Chartres (no. 4), a nephew of Louis XIV, would serve as young Louis XV's Regent, governing France from 1715 to 1723.",
