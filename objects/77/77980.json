  "text": "Portrait of the strong boy Shirataki Saijirō from the town Fukaya along the Nakasendō highway. He is captured at age 14, 5 shaku 8 sun tall (ca. 69 in. / 176 cm) and 23 kanme (ca. 190 lb / 86 kg) weight. His career as a sumo wrestler in Edo was very brief and he only appeared in one tournament in the 11th lunar month 1813 where he lost all bouts. This near-pristine print must have been produced shortly thereafter.",
