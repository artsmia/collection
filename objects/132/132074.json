  "text": "Used by members of an initiatory association some eighty years ago, this Yanda figure shows traces of ritual libations on its surface. It has been adorned with a brass ring around the waist, a gift of its owner to show their gratitude for its efficacy. People resorted to Yanda figures to ensure a successful hunt or harvest, to protect themselves against disease or witchcraft, and to promote health and, above all, fertility. The protruding navel refers to this concern about offspring, and the sculptor beautifully organized the highly stylized body around this central feature.",
