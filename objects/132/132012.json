  "text": "Johanna Metzner studied in Weimar, Germany, and is thought to have lived in nearby Erfurt. After printing Garden Bouquet, she went back in with a brush and added hand coloring to the blues and purples, and decorated the background with slashes of tan.\r\n\r\nBecause woodcuts didn’t require a printing press, people could make them at home. They simply needed a knife, a block of wood or linoleum, inks, and a wooden spoon to rub along the back of the paper to transfer color from the inked block.",
