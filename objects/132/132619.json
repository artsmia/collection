  "text": "In the series Remembrance, Maki explored the line between legibility and illegibility. The forms are reminiscent of Japanese cursive script (kuzushiji), which often features connected, simplified characters derived from Chinese characters (kanji). Maki retained the distinct strokes and fluid lines common in Japanese and Chinese writing, but he combined them nonsensically, creating a language that appears legible but is not. In the three prints shown here, Maki used paper embedded with thin strips of fiber, which appear through the dark, printed areas",
