  "text": "The surfaces of Idoma currency blades are characteristically scratched and ribbed, as is the case here. Usually the currency has a single triangular shape on top and ends in a sharp point on the bottom. Here, a second triangle has been joined on the side, while the point, which ends in a snake’s head, has been twisted around itself to form a circle. Without knowing the intentions of those who made or used it, we are left to ask: are these additions mere embellishments, or do they indicate noneconomic uses of this iron?",
