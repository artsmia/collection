  "text": "Published in London just after World War I (1914–18), this print was so popular that Hall Thorpe later made a smaller, cheaper version for broad distribution. He learned woodcutting as a newspaper illustrator in Sydney, Australia, in the 1890s, when articles were still illustrated with wood engravings. That job would have taught him to translate scenes into patterns of light and dark, a skill apparent in his trees.",
