  "text": "Accents of color punctuate a mass of symbols clustered together in ordered chaos. Lines crisscross and merge from one symbol to another, creating the effect of solidity. While Maki was known primarily for his cursive-like writing forms (as evident in works in Gallery 237), he also played with basic geometric shapes, some of which could be construed as pictographs.\r\nIn his later works, Maki often spotlighted single characters. Nonetheless, he would retain an interest in filling the entire sheet of paper, replacing the mass of symbols with the scratched surface of cement.",
