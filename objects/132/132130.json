  "text": "Perhaps because the Avalon Ballroom’s “Sin Dance” concert was canceled, its poster from Wes Wilson is one that collectors especially covet. It has all the essential elements of psychedelic poster art—vibrating colors, text that must be studied to be read, and a composition arranged around a central figure. Wilson appropriated the image of the nude woman from an 1893 oil painting titled Die Suende (The Sin) by the German artist Franz von Stuck (1863-1928) and used the snake’s body as a frame for the promotional text, adding extra coiling to create space for the three-band line-up. Stuck’s painting was also used as source material for two later Family Dog promotions by Stanley Mouse and Alton Kelley, demonstrating how Family Dog repeatedly used imagery that would associate their productions with an aura of forbidden desire.",
