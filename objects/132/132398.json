  "text": "Though it has the shape of a throwing knife (seen nearby), this blade was never intended as a weapon. Too unwieldy and too fragile for combat, it served both as a scepter and a token of currency. Throughout Africa, iron objects were used as a means of exchange, which by definition often symbolized political authority.",
