  "text": "Imanishi Masaya works in the traditional art of sometsuke—white porcelain decorated with underglaze cobalt blue. Born in Nara, Japan, to renowned potter Imanishi Hiroshi (a student of Living National Treasure Tomimoto Kenkichi), Masaya trained with the celebrated master of sometsuke and Living National Treasure Kondo Yūzō (1902–1985). Imanishi’s works often feature natural motifs, some drawn from traditional sometsuke pottery created in Japan in the 1600s and 1700s, and others wholly novel.",
