  "text": "This mysterious print shows elements of Symbolism, a movement that arrived in Switzerland around 1890. Symbolist imagery could flow from an artist’s inner moods or dreams, or—as might be the case here—texts. Such imagery could also contain a dose of eroticism. According to Ovid’s Metamorphoses, the Roman god Mercury killed the watchman Argus, who had a hundred eyes. The goddess Juno then honored Argus by putting his eyes on the peacock’s tail. Perhaps the figure, outlined in pale blue and highlighted in white, feels the gaze of those hundred eyes.",
