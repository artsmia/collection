  "text": "A scowling figure made of metal with multiple limbs and faces stands with his arms raised and teeth bared. His faces, all similarly glaring at the viewer, are stacked above him as though part of an elaborate headdress. His body is decorated with flames, skulls, and heads, and long feathered wings stretch out behind him. His wrists are adorned with jeweled bracelets. A second, much smaller figure clings to his chest. The figure’s face is not visible, but one leg is wrapped around his waist. The main figure is standing on two human figures, who are laying on a lotus-shaped platform.",
