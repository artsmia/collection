  "art_champions_text": "Conservation cost: $1,735\r\nThis fascinating sculpture depicts the deity Hayagriva, a wrathful manifestation of the God of Compassion in Tibetan Buddhism. The figure strides atop splayed bodies while embracing his consort Naraitmya. Together, they represent the union of compassion and wisdom, as their physical ecstasy becomes one with the great bliss of enlightenment.\r\nThough richly detailed and full of forceful energy, this sculpture is structurally unstable and requires conservation before it can be safely displayed. Conservation may also enable important discoveries. A rolled piece of paper tucked inside the sculpture likely contains a Buddhist creed—its safe removal could allow it to be translated for research and display, adding to our knowledge of this sculpture and the people who venerated it. \r\nContact the Chinese, South and Southeast Asian Art Department at CSSAA@artsmia.org or (612) 870-3220 to Champion this artwork.",

  "text": "In Tibetan Buddhism, Hayagriva is worshiped as a wrathful emanation of Avalokiteshvara, the Bodhisattva of Compassion. Here, the yidam (personal meditational deity) is identified by the two horse (haya) heads rearing from his flaming hair. This finely cast sculpture features Hayagriva striding atop prostrate bodies and in yamyum (sexual embrace, or “father-mother” pose) with his consort Naraitmya. Their union represents the non-dualistic enjoining of compassion and wisdom, and their physical ecstasy is one with the great bliss (paramasukha) of enlightenment.",
