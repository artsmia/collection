  "text": "Emil Pottner broke a few rules with this print. He shifted his color blocks so that they were slightly out of register, even though he had little squares in the margin to aid in proper alignment. The shift resulted in a lively sense of movement, a nonstop peeping, pecking, and waddling. \r\n\r\nBirds were a lifelong subject for Pottner, and he saw all kinds outside his door in Petzow, Germany, a spot along the Havel River near Berlin. In 1938 the Nazis forced Pottner, who was Jewish, from his home. He died after being deported to the Treblinka death camp in 1942.",
