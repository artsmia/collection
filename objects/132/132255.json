  "text": "Long tubular structures, like tentacles,\r\nLarger than life,\r\nSpeak of what is required for the African\r\nTo emerge victorious\r\nNo matter how many rounds it takes.\r\n\r\nIt starts with long strands of multicolored Czech glass beads, wrapped around\r\nhand stitched appendages crafted from bundled fabric, bits of soil, plant life,\r\nrum, bone, or even saliva.\r\n\r\nThe artist says, “There is a prayer inside each of these forms, a prayer, coins, or\r\nother things that are symbolic.”\r\n\r\nThus, the work delves into the collective unconscious, encodes and remembers\r\nAfrican cultural memory, and offers it as an invitation to healing.\r\n\r\nMoving us outside of time\r\nConnecting us through strands of DNA,\r\nQuite literally, to the Ancestors—their knowledge-spirituality\r\nTheir stature, their power.",
