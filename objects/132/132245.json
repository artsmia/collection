  "text": "David Rathman’s ink and watercolor drawing features a series of five black-and-white vignettes of the historic 1974 boxing match between undefeated world heavyweight champion George Foreman and challenger and former heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali. Held in Kinshasa, Zaire (now Congo), the fight, commonly known as the “Rumble in the Jungle, ” caused an international sensation with an estimated one billion viewers worldwide watching the live televised broadcast. Though the two boxers were closely matched, Ali won by a knockout in the eighth round. Only two of the five scenes in Rathman’s drawing depict actual action in the ring, while two others show the fighters at rest, and one highlights the raucous crowd of spectators. Together the five vignettes convey the drama and excitement of this iconic battle between two of boxing’s titans.",
