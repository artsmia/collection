  "text": "Maija Peeples-Bright came of age in the 1960s, when she joined Robert Arneson, Roy DeForest, William Wiley, and other prominent artists of the nascent Funk Art movement that originated at the University of California-Davis, where she had received her advanced training in art.  Beast Haystacks (1968) is characteristic of her work from the period in which she creates elaborate fantasy worlds populated by a menagerie of real and imaginary animals. Though her work typically features vivid color, this black-and-white line etching nonetheless conveys the dynamic energy, playfulness, and dream-like qualities for which Peeples-Bright is best known.",
