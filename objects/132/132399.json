  "text": "This ritual wand was used by a rainmaker, who either planted it in the ground or placed it in a clay vessel to influence the weather. The zigzag-shaped elements represent the flash of lightning and also refer to the sudden movements of slithering snakes, thought to forecast the coming of rain. In the past, the Mumuye peoples of Nigeria used sinuous rods of forged iron as currency. A dozen such irons were bundled together to create this wand.",
