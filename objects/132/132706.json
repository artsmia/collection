  "text": "Born to a family of artists in Kyoto, Dōmoto Hisao was primarily trained as a nihonga (Japanese-style painting) artist in his youth. When he moved to France in 1955, it became increasingly more difficult for him to continue using Japanese pigments as the dominant medium for his artworks, and he switched to oil painting. While in Paris he soon became associated with Art Informel, a movement led by critic and dealer Michel Tapié (1909-1987). Dōmoto’s work took on an Abstractionist flair and Tapié lavished praise on Domoto’s works that the importance of space was at the heart of the artist’s success at marrying Eastern and Western influences.   \r\n",
