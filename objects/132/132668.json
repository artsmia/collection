  "text": "Imanishi Masaya works in the traditional art of sometsuke—white porcelain decorated with underglaze cobalt blue. Born in Nara, Japan to renowned potter Imanishi Hiroshi (a student of Living National Treasure and fellow Nara resident Tomimoto Kenkichi), Masaya trained with the celebrated master of sometsuke and Living National Treasure Kondo Yūzō (1902–1985). His works often feature natural motifs, some drawn from traditional sometsuke pottery created in Japan in the 1600s and 1700s, and others wholly novel.",
