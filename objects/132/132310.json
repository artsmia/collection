  "text": "The fruit of the gourd, one of Africa’s earliest cultivated plants, has long been employed for purposes ranging from the obvious to the ingenious. The hollowed-out shells of gourds are used for storage or for serving food and drink. Gourds may also be used to make head coverings for babies, musical instruments, smoking pipes, or ritual regalia. This gourd was used as a container for liquids. Its exterior is embellished by pyro-engraving, which involves burning lines into the surface with a heated blade. At one point in its life cycle, the shell was cracked. An indigenous repair with plant fiber shows the value it had for its users.",
