  "text": "Robert Fried’s “Sky Web” concert poster repurposes a widely published image of an experimental hang glider flown by German aviation pioneer Otto Lilienthal (1848-1896), whose bird-like glider designs of the 1890s were important precursors to mechanical flight. In this surreal, dream-like landscape, the daredevil aviator crosses a brilliant yellow sun set high in an orange sky. He is enveloped by a radiating web of curved lines that stretch outward to convey a sense of infinite dimensional space and the plasticity of time, qualities that Fried experienced while using the hallucinogenic drug LSD. Nearly indecipherable orange text is emblazoned across the rolling blue-green hills bearing the names of the performers, the concert dates, and the venue details.",
