  "text": "Frank Stella’s Pergusa Three, was the result of a close collaboration with master printer Kenneth Tyler (born 1931), founder of the renowned American print workshop Tyler Graphics. Produced in 1983, this editioned work is part of a series of 16 large-scale, mixed media prints called “Circuits,” which were inspired by Stella’s longstanding interest in auto racing. Each print in the series is named for an international race track that Stella had visited in the 1970s. Pergusa Three references the Autodromo di Pergusa, an automobile and motorcycle circuit that encircles Pergusa Lake in Sicily, Italy. For this print, Stella created a complex amalgam of geometric forms, brilliant color, contrasting tones, and textured surfaces, whose exuberant and rhythmic dynamic was intended to mirror the excitement and spectacle of auto racing itself.",
