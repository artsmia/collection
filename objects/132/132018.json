  "text": "Even without seeing this person’s face, Minnesotans understand how it feels to trudge across a limitless expanse of white. The figure’s hunched form is weighed down just like the snow-covered branches. The diagonal footprints, the wintry weather effects, and the succinct details all show the influence of Japanese prints, which Hedwig Jarke could have seen in Germany by 1900. Her printmaking teacher, Emil Orlik (1870–1932), was among the few Europeans who visited Japan to learn the secrets of its woodblock artists firsthand.",
