  "text": "Anda Klancic’s practice traverses fashion design, fiber sculpture, machine-made lace, and photography. She has transformed the medium of machine-embroidered lace by pushing the technique into the realm of three-dimensional sculpture. Machine-embroidered lace typically involves a temporary water-soluble base fabric that, once dissolved, leaves behind a flat, flexible piece of lace. Klancic’s technical innovations give body and shape to her creations. Em-braced by Nature is equally evocative of a brittle, decaying leaf and a stiff, figure-hugging corset.",
