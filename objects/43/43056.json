  "text": "A native of Kansas, John Steuart Curry was closed associated with Regionalism, a realist modern art movement popular in America from the 1920s through the 1950s. In this lithograph, Curry portrays John Brown, an intriguing historical figure who devoted his life to the opposition of slavery, in particular the effort to block the extension of slavery into the Kansas Territory in the 1850s. Based on a scene from Curry’s mural in the Kansas State Capitol, Brown is shown as a heroic, larger-than-life figure standing amid a stark prairie landscape beset by a tornado, a foreboding harbinger of conflict. A young slave, with an expression of hope and awe, looks on. The abolitionist’s outstretched arms and wild-eyed countenance underscore the uncompromising zeal of his opposition to human bondage.",
