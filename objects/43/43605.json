  "text": "A leading symbolist painter and printmaker of the late 1800s, Max Klinger demonstrated his mastery of Romantic landscape in images such as this dreamlike scene of a centaur chased through tall grass by three naked horsemen. Pursued Centaur is from a portfolio of 12 prints exploring themes of desire, death, and fantasy. The imagined life of centaurs (half-horse, half-human creatures from Greek mythology) was a frequent subject for Klinger. He used centaurs as metaphors evoking the mysteries of modern life, especially the intersection of fantasy and reality. The Surrealists of the early 1900s often cited Klinger as a forerunner of their own explorations of the modern imagination.",
