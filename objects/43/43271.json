  "text": "Howard Cook’s stylized rendering of the southern end of New York’s Manhattan Island emphasizes the city’s magnificent formal beauty.  Home to the city’s financial district, the area is shown from the vantage point of the borough of Brooklyn, looking northwest over the East River. The dense curtain of edifices is anchored by the Woolworth Building, an iconic, early skyscraper that towers above its neighbors. Then the tallest building in the world, its status would be eclipsed with the opening of the 102-story Empire State Building in 1931.",
