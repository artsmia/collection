  "text": "Joseph Pennell evokes complex reactions from connoisseurs of etchings, for he was both a fervent anti-Semite and a master of his craft.  He was largely self taught, but acknowledged that James McNeill Whistler was the greatest etcher of them all… [he] is and always will be my master. The atmospheric tone and choice of subject of this print owe much to Whistler's influence.",
