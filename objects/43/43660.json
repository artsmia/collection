  "text": "Skijoring is a recreational and competitive winter sport in which a person on skis is pulled by a horse, dog, or motor vehicle such as a snowmobile or ATV. Though its origin is unknown, the sport is most popular in Scandinavia and mountainous areas of central Europe. In equestrian skijoring, a single horse and rider tow a person on skis, using a long rope, similar to waterskiing.\r\n\r\nLill Tschudi trained in printmaking at London’s modernist Grosvenor School. In this ingeniously designed linocut, she captured the speed and spirit of skijoring by skillfully weaving line, form, and pattern within the compressed space of a circle.",
