  "text": "Book ownership was a point of pride for patrician families in Germany, as we know from bookplate commissions. This strange coat of arms belonged to Johannes Guilhelmus Kress von Kressenstein of Nuremberg. Each element is symbolic, from the crowns' peacock feathers (immortality) to the olive leaf wreath (harmony). The small crest with a blank ring nestled in the acanthus leaves at right is the arms of Kress's wife, Susanna Kolerin. The little escutcheons in the corners may belong to Kress relatives.",
