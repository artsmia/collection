  "text": "Rufino Tamayo was a leading 20th-century Latin American artist during the 1940s, working with Stanley Hayter at the celebrated print workshop Atelier 17, located at the time in New York City. He pursued traditional subjects in his art, typically avoiding the political content found in the work of many of his fellow Mexican artists. He produced this austere nocturnal landscape using the intaglio process of mixografia, a printing technique he helped invent. It was developed to capture textures and surface details more commonly seen in painting, collage, or bas-relief. The labor intensive process requires a high-pressure printing press to simultaneously emboss thick handmade paper and transfer one or more colors.",
