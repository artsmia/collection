  "text": "Rufino Tamayo was a leading 20th-century Latin American paintner and printmaker who was active both in Mexico and the United States. During the 1940s, he worked with Stanley Hayter at the celebrated print workshop Atelier 17, then located in New York City. He pursued traditional subjects in his art, typically avoiding the leftist political content found in the work of many of his fellow Mexican artists. He produced this austere nocturnal landscape using the intaglio process of mixografia, a three-dimensional printing technique he helped invent. It was developed to capture textures and surface details more commonly seen in painting, collage, or bas-relief. The labor-intensive process requires a high-pressure printing press to simultaneously emboss thick handmade paper and transfer one or more colors.",
