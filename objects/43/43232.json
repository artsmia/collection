  "text": "Paul Sandby’s print could easily be confused for a drawing. The artist, one of the first to use the term “aquatint, ” published his first series of aquatint etchings in 1775. They are based on a series of landscape watercolors Sandby did in Wales, with the aquatint imitating the artist’s celebrated subtle wash transitions. Here he even mimics the watercolor mounts used for old master drawings, adding a tinted aquatint frame around the image.",
