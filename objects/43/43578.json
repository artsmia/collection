  "text": "Brooklyn-based artist Lorna Simpson is best known for her photographic works that address issues ranging from racial and sexual identity, to ideas of the body, to interpersonal communication and relationships. She draws on personal experiences, politics, and African American culture and history to develop her imagery.  Using metaphor, suggestion, and storytelling, she presents her subjects obliquely, often pairing images of isolated or fragmentary objects or the human figure together with words or phrases that evoke emotion and memory.",
