  "text": "Brooklyn-based artist Lorna Simpson is best known for her photographic works that address issues ranging from racial and sexual identity, to ideas of the body, to interpersonal communication and relationships. Her works are inspired from various sources, including personal experience, the current political climate, and African-American culture and history. She presents her subjects indirectly through metaphor, suggestion, and personal biography.  She often pairs isolated details of the human figure or objects with fragments of text to evoke emotional responses. Simpson's works typically engage the viewer's own experience as a means of interpreting her images and use of language.",
