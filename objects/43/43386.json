  "text": "Given society's fear of women-particularly acute in the anxiety-ridden years before the millennium-it was but a small leap to the label of witch. In 1496, Nuremberg saw a second printing of Malleus Maleficarum (The Witches' Hammer), a handbook for detecting witches. It said women's insatiable desires made them throw in with the devil. This 1497 print hints at conspiratorial mischief as four powerful nudes loom above a skull and bone, while a demon lurches at left. The \"O.G.H.\" on the globe may stand for O Gott hüte (O God protect).",
