  "text": "Francis Seymour Haden had an uneven relationship with his young brother-in-law James McNeill Whistler.  When Haden etched this view of the river Thames in London-a subject then associated with Whistler-the two were on good terms.  Each was recognized for the excellence of his art, and they seemed supportive of each other's successes.  In time, however, their relationship grew tainted with rivalry and petty jealousies centered on artistic recognition.  In 1867 there was a final break; Haden accused Whistler of immorality, and Whistler threw Haden through the glass window of a Paris restaurant.",
