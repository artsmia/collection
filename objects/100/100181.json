  "text": "Although Mark Hewitt grew up in Stoke-on-Trent, England, as the son and grandson of directors of the venerable Spode pottery, he turned away from industrial ceramics and toward the mingei, or folk art, ceramic traditions promoted in Britain in the in the 1920s by Japanese potter Shoji Hamada.  Bernard Leach and his apprentices, including Warren MacKenzie and Michael Cardew, were all major proponents of the mingei pottery tradition.  Drawn to the mingei principles of the beautiful everyday object made by hand, Hewitt apprenticed to Cardew in Cornwall, England, in the 1970s.  \r\n\r\nHewitt settled near Chapel Hill, North Carolina in 1983 and has, like MacKenzie, steadfastly held to the functional tradition, utilizing rich local clays. He has also become a master of the big pot.  <I>Leaping Lizards</I> displays his extreme control of form combined with the serendipity of the salt-glaze technique he favors.  The incised lizard designs show the important influence African ceramics have also had on his work.",
