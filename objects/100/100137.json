  "text": "In the desert region of Rajasthan, rural and urban women wore essentially the same costume comprising an odhani (veil), kanchli (blouse) and gaghra (skirt). Differences in social rank were emphasized by differences in fabric and decoration. Nothing signaled high status more than the lavish display of gold and silver.   \r\n\r\nThis woman's outfit from a noble Rajasthani family makes use of fine cotton muslin decorated with gota, a gilded silver ribbon. Such fabric was a staple of north Indian royal dress for both men and women. Here, the veil is particularly notable. When draped over head and shoulders, the exuberantly fringed borders became a dazzling halo for the royal face.",
