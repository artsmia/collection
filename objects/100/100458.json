  "text": "Grinager made this photographic study for Boys Bathing onsite along the banks of the Mississippi River, down by Bohemian Flats (between the current 10th Avenue and Washington Avenue bridges). A stamp on the verso reveals that the image was processed by a photo studio on Nicollet Avenue, just down the street from Grinagerâ€™s painting studio. Undoubtedly, some of the boys who are featured in this photograph eventually appeared in the final Boys Bathing composition.",
