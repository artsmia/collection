  "text": "This cotton ikat fabric is from an unused stockpile of similar <I>telia</I> cloth - so-called because the traditional dyeing process involved treating the threads with sesame oil (<I>tel</I>).  Produced in the southeast Indian coastal town of Chirala, <I>telia</I> cloth found a ready market in Hyderabad, the area's main trade center.  The fabric, often decorated with white embroidery, made an attractive head covering for women.  Men wore it plain as a waist wrap.",
