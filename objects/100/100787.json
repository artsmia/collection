  "text": "Brassaï’s photograph of the famous Spanish artist Pablo Picasso, places Picasso in a foreboding shadow of a stove. The photograph also implies a relationship between Brassaï and Picasso in his comfort in sitting for the camera, as his expression seems relaxed. Picasso’s eyes look away from the camera, as if in conversation, and he might be gesturing with his hand.",
