  "text": "The modern glass surface of the Equitable Building in St. Louis, Missouri, reflects a view of the Old St. Louis Courthouse (opened in 1864). This photograph was one of hundreds taken by photographers throughout the United States documenting county courthouses as part of a project funded by Joseph E. Seagram’s and Sons Inc., marking the bicentennial of the United States. Clift’s approach to photographing the courthouse physically contextualizes it within the St. Louis landscape.",
