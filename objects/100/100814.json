  "text": "This book, from a two-volume set, depicts annual events and ceremonial scenes in Edo's licensed pleasure quarter, known as the Yoshiwara. The <I>niwaka</I> festival depicted here was one of the most extravagant of these occasions. <I>Niwaka</I>, meaning spontaneous, originally referred to impromptu comedy skits. The festival consisted of costumed processions, a parade of floats, and the <I>niwaka</I> skits. This scene shows a <I>shishi-mai</I>, a lion dance in which performers carry a large, fantastic lion-like mask.  Traditionally lion dances in the more stately Nō theater were performed as an act of exorcism, but in the Yoshiwara's <I>niwaka</I> festival the religious significance was downplayed in favor of the lighthearted merriment and spectacle of women dressed in fanciful costumes.",
