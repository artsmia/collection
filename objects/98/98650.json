  "text": "Carole Hetzel had a sustained interest in shape long before she began adding steel cable to her colorful hand-dyed baskets. But with the addition of metal her experiments in form became more daring. \r\n\r\nAccording to Hetzel, “Baskets tell a story. To appreciate a basket is like interacting with a painting, a novel, music, or any of the arts. Not only does a basket have a purpose and message, it also has a sense of history.” Hetzel lives in Florida and North Carolina.",
