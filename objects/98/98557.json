  "text": "In the mid 1970s French weaving mills began producing fabrics that were almost ten feet in width.  Jack was particularly excited by this development as he saw a great advantage for its use in window treatments. The fabric could be railroaded and an entire window could be covered with a single piece of cloth. These design possibilities were quickly adopted by the Larsen Design Studio, resulting in a number of new pattern introductions. <P>\r\n<I>Seascape</I> became a signature piece for the company after it was used in a dramatic style shot that received wide exposure. The design was printed on two different ground cloths. <I>Seascape on Broadside</I> was a linen and cotton fabric created for draperies, but Jack’s use of it in his Long Island home, Roundhouse, as wall covering showed it had a variety of uses. <I>Seascape Sheer</I> was a devoré (acid burn-out) print on a polyester and cotton fabric.",
