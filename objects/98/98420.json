  "text": "Although Kakurezaki Ryūichi was not originally from the Bizen area, he apprenticed with Isezaki Jun (born 1936), the fifth Bizen potter designated a Living National Treasure. Kakurezaki has forged a reputation for his innovative, sculptural designs that make use of traditional Bizen clay and firing techniques. Here, a roughly carved flower vase with three legs reflects his avant-garde style.",
