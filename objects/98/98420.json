  "text": "Kakurezaki Ryu_ichi apprenticed with the Bizen potter, Isezaki Jun (born 1936)--recently designated Living National Treasure--even though Kakurezaki himself was not originally from the Bizen area. Nevertheless, he has forged a reputation for his innovative, sculptural designs that make use of traditional Bizen clay and firing techniques. Here, a roughly carved flower vase with three legs reflects his avant-garde style.",
