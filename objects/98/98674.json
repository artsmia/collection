  "text": "The German-born Kloppman, who has for a number of years maintained studio and gallery space in northeast Minneapolis, is another artist who, like Ruth Duckworth, has mastered the porcelain medium for vessels as well as sculptural pieces. \r\n\r\nThis is somewhat of an uncharacteristic piece for Kloppman, whose work is generally known for its geometric and symmetrical qualities. The generous bowl, with its slightly undulating edge, reveals a celadon high-glaze interior beyond the matte white porcelain exterior.",
