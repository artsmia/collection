  "text": "The Western world strongly associates beauty with good fortune. This connection is not taken for granted in South Asia. The region's folklore holds a deep-seated fear that beauty and happiness may attract the attention of envious evil spirits. Symbolic defacement serves as a protective charm.  A black mark is drawn on a child's forehead; a dark spot is embroidered on a woman's wedding veil.",
