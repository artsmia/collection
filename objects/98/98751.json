  "text": "Artist and educator Marion Hunt Doig lends her contemporary perspective to the button blanket, a tradition that dates back to the early 1800s and the first contact between European fur traders and tribes on the Northwest Coast. First Nations artists obtained navy wool blankets through trade, adding red cloth and abalone shells to create family crests. Button blankets are worn at potlatches, gift-giving feasts that celebrate social milestones and chiefly status.",
