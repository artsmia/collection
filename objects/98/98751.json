  "text": "Button blankets combine wool cloth with glittering buttons made from abalone shells, a display of family crest designs in Northwest Coast communities. The blankets are worn on several occasions to show the strength and power of individual chiefs and lineages, most notably during potlatches, grand social events centered on abundance—of food, dance, and regalia. This particular blanket was made by Mary Hunt Doig, a leader in her community. She spent her life teaching about the traditions, ceremonial objects, and clothing that define Northwest Coast cultures.",
