  "text": "Sonia Delaunay-Terk, often collaborated with her husband Robert Delaunay. Geometric Abstraction uses the concept of simultanéisme, but instead of using lines, as seen in the fabric Ulysee, Delaunay-Terk dominated this textile with geometric shapes and colors which seem to infuse the piece with energetic movement. Here, the stronger contrasts of red, yellow, blue, and green dominate the diagonals of the panel, relieved by areas of gray and white squares, giving the illusion that this pattern could continue without end. An abstract yet still functional piece, Geometric Abstraction is similar to various designs Delaunay-Terk developed in the 1920s for avant-garde clothing.",
