  "text": "This <I>sobrehuipil's</I> horizontal bands of burgundy and gold are hallmarks of <I>huipiles</I> from San Pedro Sacatepéquez. Symbolic of longevity, the distinctive pattern is associated with the sacred <I>ceiba</I> tree, the <I>axis mundi</I> that connects the upper, middle and underworlds. \r\n\r\nThe typical ceremonial sobrehuipil from San Pedro Sacatepéquez was fabricated in two panels, hand-embroidered down the center, and left open at the sides. This huipil is unusual in that it retains none of those characteristics.  Even more unusual is the inclusion of a non-matching third panel, seen at right.  The reason for its inclusion is unclear, but perhaps the owner lovingly pieced together a new garment to salvage a worn but sentimental huipil. She then creatively adorned her new huipil with imported lace and ribbon.  \r\n",
