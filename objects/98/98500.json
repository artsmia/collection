  "text": "In general, Asante cloths are given names based on the pattern of warp stripes that comprise the ground cloth. Because this piece has a solid color for the background, the cloth would likely be named after the predominant design element, which in this case is <I>nkyimkyim</I>, or zigzag pattern. This design symbolizes the idea that life is not a straight line, but is rather a crooked path that requires qualities of prudence, vigilance and balance to navigate. \r\n\r\nThis is an example of <I>adweneasa</I> (fullness of design) in which every inch of cloth is covered with weft patterns. <I>Adweneasa cloths</I> are considered to be the most prestigious of kente cloths and are attempted by only the most skilled weavers. The high quality of the weaving, the richness of ornamentation, and the use of a double-weave, weft-face technique indicates that this cloth was created for a person of considerable wealth and status.",
