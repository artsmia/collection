While on his way to Damascus to imprison Christians and transport them to Jerusalem, he was blinded and knocked from his horse by a blazing light from heaven and heard the voice of Jesus speaking to him. When he regained his sight three days later, Saul changed his name to Paul and became a missionary, ardently preaching that Jesus was truly the Messiah and the son of God.",
