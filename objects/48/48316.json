  "text": "When James McNeill Whistler (1834-1903) revived lithography in England in the 1890s, Charles Shannon had found his medium. His finest prints are portraits and figure studies-often rendered wistfully in grays, greens and reddish browns. In England Shannon worked among a rarified group of artists concerned with beauty and a romantic ideal, as reflected in the poetic The Swimmer. Many of his lithographs appeared in The Dial, a periodical Shannon published with his lifelong friend and collaborator, Charles Ricketts (1866-1931). In 1929 Shannon fell and hit his head while hanging a picture and was an invalid for the rest of his life.",
