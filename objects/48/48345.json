  "text": "Bathsheba was bathing one hot day when King David spotted her from his balcony. Powerless against her beauty, he bowed to temptation and lay with her (2 Samuel 11:4). She was blamed for not refusing David and for unleashing the powers of sin: Bathsheba became pregnant, David had her husband murdered, and the baby died as God's punishment. Here the small, dark openings in the architecture resemble so many eyes spellbound, like David, by Bathsheba's nakedness.",
