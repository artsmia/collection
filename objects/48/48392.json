  "text": "Coupled with the 16th-century fear of women was the fear of appearing the fool-whether in love, marriage, or social conduct. Here two fools sit in a ramshackle love garden with their ass's ears (indicating lack of reason) and their respective and quite explicit attributes. The buzzing flies connote love-making. A female fool was most unusual, perhaps an implication that women are susceptible to love's temptations, too.",
