  "text": "Mezzotint enabled eighteenth-century printmakers to make a fine living reproducing oil paintings by other artists. The technique allowed for striking gradations of shading and texture, all wrapped in a cloak of flattering softness. Portraits topped the list of popular mezzotint genres, with subjects ranging from actresses to people with deformities. Mezzotinters particularly clamored to copy paintings by Sir Joshua Reynolds, and the savvy Reynolds was evidently happy to let them. Here Valentine Green copied a 1773 self-portrait by the painter, who seemingly cast himself as a doctor of civil laws. This rich, velvety impression exemplifies the strength of the vast group of mezzotints in the Herschel V. Jones Collection.",
