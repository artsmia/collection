  "text": "This rare club has a horned figure carved into the top, possibly representing Maymaygwayshi, water spirits that live on riverbanks. Though usually harmless, the Maymaygwayshi can be mischievous—they might blow your canoe away from shore if you don’t show them proper respect. The other figure is an Underwater Panther, another type of supernatural being. The ball club was an important weapon. Men often cultivated trees near a riverbank, establishing a “crook” between the roots and the trunk of young saplings that would eventually become a burl and could be carved into the curved shape seen here.",
