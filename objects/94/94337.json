  "text": "There are six major divisions among the Indé (Apache) peoples.  Of them, the Jicarilla and Western Apache are most known for their baskets.  The Western Apache construct coils made from cottonwood that are stitched with willow and devil's claw.  Like their O'odham (Papago/Pima) neighbors, most Western Apache baskets were made for Euro-American customers by the turn of the century.  Their two primary forms are shallow bowls and vase-shaped baskets.  Simple baskets with modest designs were characteristic of the years between 1860 and 1890, but designs became progressively more complex and dynamic until 1940.  The black rim of devil's claw is a common feature on Western Apache baskets. Designs on bowls radiate from the center, and in between the radiating spokes, Western Apache basket makers are known to add figures of dogs, deer or humans.",
