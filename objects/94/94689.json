  "text": "Pieced quilts, such as this, require fabric components that are uniform in shape and size. Variations can distort the overall design. To ensure standardization, quilters often use templates to cut fabric pieces accurately. In the late 1800s, templates were cut from sheets of tin or paper. Today, they are often made from plastic.\r\n\r\nThe LeMoyne Star pattern was, and still is, widely used throughout much of the United States. LeMoyne stars have eight points composed of diamond-shaped pieces of fabric. By alternating red and blue fabric, the quilter made these stars look like pinwheels in motion.",
