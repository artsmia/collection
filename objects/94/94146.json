  "text": "In this <I>huipil</I>, the red from the silk yarn has bled onto the white cotton fabric.  Although it was common knowledge that silk yarns were not color-fast, the weaver's decision to use the brightly-colored yarn was a deliberate artistic choice. The run-off from the dye did not ruin her garment; instead, it showcased the artist's ability to purchase expensive, imported silk. This prestige blouse would be worn to a <I>cofradía</I> ceremony, further solidifying her high status as a woman of honor and responsibility. The cofradía is a community-based religious group, responsible for ceremonies as well as the care of their local Catholic church.\r\n\r\nA careful inspection of the delicate embroidery reveals a large double-headed eagle.  Stylistically inspired by the heraldic eagle of the Hapsburg royal family of Spain, the motif also represents the continued prevalence of pre-Conquest cosmology and imagery. The eagle's ability to turn its head to look both forward and backward is a manifestation of the Mayan concept of duality.",
