  "text": "Few textiles from the Moche culture have survived Northern Peru’s damp climate intact, but expressive ceramics give us clues into the textile tradition. This jar depicts an elite couple dining on seafood. Moche artists represented people of high status wearing luxurious patterned garments through detailed painted designs, while commoners wore plain clothing. This couple’s rank is also indicated by their head coverings and face paint. Vessels like this were too elaborate for daily use and likely reserved for ceremonial occasions and for inclusion in burials.",
