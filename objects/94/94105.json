  "text": "Hand built in the form of a shou (longevity) character with a curved handle and long s-formed spout, this unusually exuberant, seemingly modern wine vessel was made over three hundred years ago. Character-form wine pots were made in three shapes: shou (longevity), fu (happiness), and lu (emolument) during the Kang-hsi reign (1662-1772). The porcelain is enameled on the bisquit with a diaper design in yellow-green and black. The handle and spout simulate wrapped bamboo.",
