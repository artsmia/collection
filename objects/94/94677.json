  "text": "Images of Yei, or Holy People, were created for a sand painting that was used within a ceremonial context. The portrayal of similar images can be found on this rug, which would have been exclusively created for the market. Yei rugs were, and continue to be, highly desirable by collectors because they are exclusively a Southwestern pattern. Although it would have been disrespectful to copy the images from a holy sandpainting, its images were an inspiration for designs like these.",
