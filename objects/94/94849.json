  "text": "Traditionally, northern Plains women made beaded buckskin amulets like these to contain their child's umbilicus and to maintain the sacred connection between mother and child. When the child is young, the amulet is often attached to their cradle or used as a toy. When the child becomes an adult, the mother or child keeps the item occasionally wears it for good luck and protection. When an amulet is traded or sold, the umbilicus is usually removed.",
