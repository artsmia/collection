  "text": "The rose is a common motif used for appliquéd and pieced quilts, with as many as thirty rose-related block patterns appearing in historical quilt sources. The Whig Rose pattern was very popular in the mid-nineteenth century, and was originally called the  Democratic Rose, reflecting it's association with two early American political parties, the Whigs and the Democrats, each claiming the pattern as their own. \r\nThis quilt is unusual for its bright yellow ground, which makes a striking contrast to the red and green color scheme. The use of two distinct variations of the block pattern contributes to its visual interest and attests to its creator's inventiveness.",
