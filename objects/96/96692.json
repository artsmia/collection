  "text": "Presumably an American or English freemason placed an order for this punch bowl and related mug decorated with the Western symbols of Masonic brotherhood, including the square, compass, anchor and All Seeing Eye.  The images may have been copied from a John Cole design in <I>Illustrations in Masonry</I>, published in  1801.  \r\n\r\nClub meetings during the 18th century often included the consumption of great quantities of punch.  In addition to sharing the beverage, drinking from a shared bowl and making group toasts added to the communal experience.",
