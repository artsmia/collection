  "text": "It is particularly fitting to find scenes of social amusements on punch bowls, as mixing and drinking punch could serve as an evening's entertainment.  This massive bowl features a ladies' supper party, gentlemen playing the card game jin, and an entertainer with hawks and mythical beasts.  On the interior, courtiers frolic amongst deities and clouds.\r\n\r\nThe same artists who painted fanciful scenes on porcelain also painted Chinese Export wallpaper, a notable example of which is featured in the MacFarlane Memorial Room on the museum's third floor.",
