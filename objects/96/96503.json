  "text": "This chair was used by brothers and sisters in the Shaker community of Enfield, CT (1793-c.1918).  Similar to chairs from other Shaker communities, like Canterbury, New Hampshire and Harvard, Massachusetts, this object is almost entirely comprised of lathe-turned posts and stretchers and has noticeably graduated rear slats.  The slight slant to the legs allows one to lean back in the chair, supported by rear tilts or ball-and-socket feet at the bottoms of the rear stiles, a distinctively Shaker feature.",
