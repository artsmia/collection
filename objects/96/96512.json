  "text": "The term for early Chinese Export porcelain is <I>kraak</I>, a derivation of the Dutch word <I>carrack</I>, the type of Portuguese ship that dominated trade with China in the 16th century.\r\n\r\nThis <I>kraak</I> bowl and the smaller one beneath were formed by pressing clay over a mold to create the appearance of panels.  The pieces were painted with borders to deliniate the panels and images inspired by nature in cobalt-blue underglaze decoration. \r\n\r\n<I>Kraak</I> wares were Europe's first introduction to Chinese porcelain, and proved tremendously popular and influential.  Factories in Delft and elsewhere in Europe imitated their blue-and-white decoration on pottery.",
