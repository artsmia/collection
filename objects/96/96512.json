  "text": "The term for early Chinese Export porcelain is kraak, a derivation of the Dutch word carrack, the type of Portuguese ship that dominated trade with China in the 16th century.\r\n\r\nThis kraak bowl and the smaller one beneath were formed by pressing clay over a mold to create the appearance of panels.  The pieces were painted with borders to deliniate the panels and images inspired by nature in cobalt-blue underglaze decoration. \r\n\r\nKraak wares were Europe's first introduction to Chinese porcelain, and proved tremendously popular and influential.  Factories in Delft and elsewhere in Europe imitated their blue-and-white decoration on pottery.",
