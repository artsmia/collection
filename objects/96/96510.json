  "text": "This rare, imperial bowl is embellished inside and out with auspicious decoration in brilliant underglaze cobalt blue. The exterior is painted with three large carp and a perch among nine other fish and aquatic plants. Fish are an emblem of wealth and abundance because of the similarity in the pronunciation yu meaning fish and another character pronounced yu meaning abundance. The carp is also a symbol of perseverance, a scholarly virtue. The interior of the vessel is decorated with cloud and crane motifs in the bottom and around the rim. These are standard Daoist emblems for long life.",
