  "description": "Listed below are the eight parts of this portfolio. Apart from the print on the cover, Roethel called the images heliogravures, but they are here described as photomechanical reproductions since they do not appear to have the etched character of heliogravures. The titles are given in English, German (as Roethel uses for his entry headings), and French (when assigned titles in the Xylographies portfolio). The original blocks were all made in 1907. 2003.180a: grey paper folder cover with Roethel 70.
