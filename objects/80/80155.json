  "description": "A little egret is bent over as if to protect itself from a heavy downpour, his pure white form silhouetted against a jet-black sky. The feathers are rendered in gauffrage. This print is perhaps the least naturalistic of all Koson's designs. The stylised, somewhat abstract, form of the egret lends it an almost Western feel: as with the previous example, it is one of Koson's most sought after prints. According to the Toledo catalogue, this print is from an edition of 300 issued in 1928. (Newland 2010)",
