  "text": "Anselm Kiefer's monumental artist’s book is a mocking denunciation of Germany's ill-conceived efforts to invade England during World War II (1939-45). This German military action, code named “Operation Sea Lion,” called for a massive fleet of naval forces in a coordinated crossing of the English Channel to overwhelm and defeat British defenses. Deemed unfeasible by the German High Command, the plan was ultimately abandoned by Adolf Hitler. Kiefer’s bathtub wargame reenactments of “Operation Sea Lion” belittle Hitler’s avowed dream of “a thousand year Reich.” The blackened and roughly textured surfaces of the hand-painted pages evoke the immense destruction and degradation of warfare.",
