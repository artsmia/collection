  "text": "Although Poésies Antillaises was published eighteen years after Matisse’s death, its overall design and illustrations had been rigorously planned by the artist. In fact, Matisse began the project in 1945. Matisse’s illustrations were comprised of a series of head and bust images of his then current models.",
