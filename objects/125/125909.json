  "text": "Muslims strongly believe in the healing powers of the Qur’an. Although reading and writing is the main purpose for Qur’anic boards, in some parts of Islamic Africa they are also used by Muslim healers, who write specific verses on them, wash off the writings, and collect the diluted ink. The liquid is given to the sick to drink as holy medicine. This board, furthermore, has numerical “mystic squares” of 4 by 4 on either side that increase its potency. Such mathematical grids, based on the belief in divine relations between numbers and events, are sometimes put to healing purposes.",
