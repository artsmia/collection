  "text": "Originally published in 1965, Kikuji Kawada’s experimental photography book Chizu is renowned for its uncompromising memorialization of the bombing and destruction of Hiroshima, Japan, by U.S. forces during World War II (1939–1945). Marking the 20th anniversary of this horrific wartime event, the book presents a graphic visual compendium of places and objects annihilated by the heat and blast from an atomic bomb, ranging from the stained walls of what is now the Hiroshima Peace Memorial to the mutilated bodies of Japanese citizens to a trampled Japanese flag. Kawada’s photo book commemorates the more than 135, 000 Japanese who were killed and injured during the bombing, while serving as a powerful documentation of recovery and transformation in postwar Japan. The present volume is a limited-edition facsimile of the original publication that precisely retains the book’s scale and innovative design and layout.",
