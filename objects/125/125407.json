  "text": "Originally trained as an architect, the Spanish artist Eduardo Chillida is best known for his abstract geometric sculptures composed of dense wood or metal. His choice of materials frequently informed his investigations of conceptual questions and metaphysical concerns. As a printmaker, Chillida’s concern for scale, material, and spatial relations is evident in the abstract illustrations he made for Le Chemin des devins, suivi de Ménerbes (The Way of the Soothsayers, after Ménerbes). Chillida’s bold monochromatic etchings aptly complement the poems written by prominent French poet André Frénaud, whose work has been described as evoking a sense of quest, “which gives it its labyrinth patterns, underground tensions and fractured, invented forms.” This publication was Chillida’s first illustrated book.",
