  "text": "Across the twelve panels of this pair of folding screens, a wide channel cuts through wavelike, emerald-green mountains brought to life through an abundance of expensive mineral and metallic pigments—malachite, azurite, gold. In the lengthy inscription—written in Chinese and brushed in distinctive ancient script—Irie Shikai cites the enigmatic opening lines of Chapter 28 (“Returning to Simplicity”) of the Dao De Ching, the ancient Chinese text, as the inspiration for this magical composition: \r\n \r\nKnow manhood, maintain womanhood, become a ravine under heaven. As a ravine under heaven,  from virtue never part,  return again to infancy.  \r\n \r\nIrie Shikai first studied painting with well-known local artists in his native Fukuoka before becoming involved briefly with an ultra-right-wing nationalist movement in midlife. During this time, he became familiar with that movement’s influential leader, Tōyama Mitsuru, and the likeminded coal barons from Fukuoka who supported Tōyama financially (the kind of wealthy patrons who might have commissioned a deluxe painting like this pair of screens). Shikai eventually drifted away from right-wing politics and devoted himself again to painting, finding inspiration particularly in the works of the earlier Japanese literati painter Tanomura Chikuden (1777–1835).",
