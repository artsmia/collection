  "text": "Widely regarded as a leading figure in the field of Bizen ceramics, Kakurezaki Ryuichi’s work is beloved also for its departures from tradition. Such is the case with this massive platter with spinous projections and oozing lustrous palladium glaze. Kakurezaki graduated from the Osaka University of the Arts and apprenticed with the Living National Treasure ceramic artist Isezaki Jun before establishing his own kiln in 1985.  His solo shows have been held in Tokyo and the United States. A major retrospective of Kakurezaki’s work was held at the Musée Tomo in Tokyo in 2014.",
