  "text": "Frederick Howard Collins was a British author and indexer (creating indexes for books) best known for his authoritative punctuation and abbreviation guide for aiding writers, editors, printers, proofreaders, and transcribers. First published in 1905 as Author & Printer, Collins’s celebrated manual was intended to codify the best typographical practices of the day. British designer and typographer John Grice acknowledged Collins’s important contributions to the art of fine printing by adapting passages from Collins’s book (1933 edition) for this elegant, limited-edition punctuation guide featuring hand-set letterpress and decorative printer’s ornaments in black and red ink on handmade cream paper.",
