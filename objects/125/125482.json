  "text": "Tristan Tzara wrote Parler seul, or Speaking Alone, at a psychiatric hospital in Lozère, France, in the summer of 1945. He wasn’t sick as much as weary: World War II had forced the Jewish poet into hiding, his wife wanted a separation, and his avant-garde colleagues had moved on. Tzara’s love of experimental wordplay was intact in this work, however, and that spirit is paralleled visually in Joan Miró’s playful, disjointed illustrations. He used circles, stars, stick figures, and fat brushstrokes to illuminate the 24 poems in the book—72 lithographs in all. The text takes a sympathetic view of mental disorders and the hospital’s women patients, and Tzara appears to have dedicated some of these poems to these women.",
