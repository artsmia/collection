  "text": "Mario Avati was born in Monaco and active in Paris. He devoted himself almost exclusively to the art of mezzotint, helping to keep alive this technique, which had gone out of fashion in the early twentieth century. The active patterning of this nocturnal cityscape creates spatial ambiguity. It borrows from Cubism, an art form that presents the viewer with multiple points of view simultaneously.",
