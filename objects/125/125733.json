  "text": "Issued in a variable edition of 20, this lithograph is part of a large group of abstract works Moses produced during the 1970s that feature layered diagonal grids of parallel and intersecting bands of color along with strips of collaged masking tape designed to enliven the surfaces and materiality of these abstractions. Working intuitively, Moses balances gesture and precision to create a geometric abstraction that is at once familiar and challenging in its pictorial complexity. His explorations of the woven pattern reflects his penchant for using “pre-designed” elements in his work, exploring pictorial ideas incrementally and sequentially within the parameters of a given abstract form or geometric element.  As part of his practice, Moses uses his own existing artworks as the basis for constructing new work and for expanding his understanding of these pictorial explorations.",
