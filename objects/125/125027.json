  "text": "Marylyn Dintenfass’ Oculus RODEN is a sensory experience. The painting provides a visceral and visual experience through its use of color, textures, and gestural marks. Dintenfass forces your eye to dart across the canvas – pushing you away and pulling you towards the canvas simultaneously. In a formal sense, the painting is about perspective, how color and gesture can make the canvas vibrate, and how revealing and concealing can impact our senses.",
