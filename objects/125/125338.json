  "text": "Painter, sculptor, and experimental musician Shinro Ohtake devised his own form of archiving  in 1977, when he began gluing objects from his life and popular culture into scrapbooks. His love of nostalgia and music came together in X+Y=LOVE, an ode to ten Japanese pop songs he grew up with. Some present lovesickness to the extreme. The song “I Want You, ” for example, talks of slicing open a loved one’s breast with a scalpel. Ohtake’s etchings can be equally raw, as in the eyeball and internal organs accompanying this song. The artist’s brittle, sometimes fragmented etchings contrast with the figures on the cover, who look like a cheery couple out of a 1950s magazine ad.",
