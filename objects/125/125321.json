  "text": "Federico García Lorca was an influential and beloved Spanish modernist poet and playwright, known for his lyrical ballads and evocative poetry. First published in Madrid in 1928, just eight years before he was assassinated, Romance sonámbulo celebrates what Lorca perceived to be the passion and intensity of the Romani people and their culture. Lorca would have known Romani people well from his upbringing in the culturally heterogeneous city of Granada, in southern Spain. Personified by the color green, the dream-like, enigmatic ballad reflects Lorca’s deep love of his country and its diverse heritage, while embracing the power of the imagination. Lorca called Romance sonámbulo, which is part of a collection of poems about Romani culture, “one of the most mysterious in the book.” The present volume is a sumptuous, one-of-a-kind collaborative adaptation of Lorca’s poem featuring a series of original oil and charcoal figure drawings by the American painter Manuel Neri and calligraphic text by Thomas Ingmire.",
