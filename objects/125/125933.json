  "text": "This three-way, telescopic desk lamp was one of Araki’s first product designs. The lamp was manufactured by the Nanbu Industrial Company (Nanbu Kōgyō), which went on to sell well more than twenty million units. Although Araki personally turned his attention to designing high-end housewares and painting in later years, the studios he established in the 1960s continued to design electronics for a variety of companies, including Radio Shack and YORX.",
