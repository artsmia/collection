  "text": "Emily Arthur’s art communicates themes of exodus, environmental degradation, and a world of beauty and decay. It also presents issues of Native American migration, displacement, and resiliency. In this print, birds and flowers in warm early morning light evoke a place alive with possibilities, beauty, and creation, while in the cool blue below, rats and dead flowers represent the cycle of decay necessary for the life above.",
