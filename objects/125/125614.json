  "text": "Sue Coe traveled the United States in 1989 with her sister, visiting slaughterhouses and factory farms. She talked her way into facilities and made drawings of the sights she witnessed there. Coe interviewed workers and documented the procedures they used for killing animals and processing their bodies. The resulting series of drawings is alarming and heart-wrenching. Egg Machines depicts a scene Coe saw throughout the country: seemingly endless indoor pens of chickens, restricting their movement as they laid egg after egg until they died. Coe has tirelessly drawn attention to human and animal rights issues in her work.",
