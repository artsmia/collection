  "text": "Famed as a sculptor of female nudes, Gaston Lachaise is credited with imparting new power to the female form. From 1912 to 1921, he worked in New York as an assistant to the sculptor and St. Paul native Paul Manship (1886–1966). Apart from his portrait busts, most of Lachaise’s works can be likened to prehistoric fertility goddesses, as in this symphony of turns, cascades, and loops.",
