  "text": "Ikenga, or “place of strength,” is the Nigerian Igbo name for this type of figure. A personal altar, it is a source of power, aggression, and achievement for the man who owns it. In Igbo society individual success and upward mobility are highly desirable. Before any major undertaking, like enrolling at a university, making an economic deal, or participating in an election, the owner of an ikenga would address it with prayers and offerings of food and kola nuts. Here, the stylized figure stands on a stool to make it taller and give it extra authority. Its head is adorned with long horns, a reference to a ram’s force and stubbornness.",
