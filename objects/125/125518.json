  "text": "Arion Press’s 1984 edition of Temple of Flora features twenty-eight large-scale, black-and-white drypoints and engravings by the noted American painter and printmaker Jim Dine, which were designed to complement a series of poems and botanical notes selected by the book’s editors. This limited-edition book was inspired by the original “Temple of Flora, ” published in 1807 by the English physician and botanist Dr. Robert John Thornton (1765¬–1837). Thornton had paired oversized color plates of flowers, set in dramatic landscapes, with inspirational poetry and notes on flower lore and legend. For his exuberant floral illustrations, Dine used a number of unconventional cutting tools such as electric drills and grinders to achieve linear variation and subtle shifts in tone, ranging from soft grays to deep blacks.",
