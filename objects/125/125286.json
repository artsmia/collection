  "text": "French artist Mario Avati loved the contrast of black and white, especially when arrayed in patterns. But here he plays with our expectation that a zebra will be black and white. This image is a good example of the shifting meaning of art in new contexts. A Frenchman might not see this image in the same way as an American schoolchild, who might associate it with that classic riddle, “What’s black and white and read all over?” Here the answer is not “A newspaper!” Rather, “A sunburned zebra!”\r\n\r\nMia has another example of this subject printed on white paper.",
