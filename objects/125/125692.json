  "text": "Beninese artist Georges Adéagbo produced this irreverent artist’s book as a parallel presentation of The Story of the Lion, an elaborate installation he displayed at the 1999 Venice Biennale, a global contemporary art exposition, where he was awarded the Prize of Honor. Like the installation, the book juxtaposes images and texts from Africa with those from European countries that had once been involved in the colonization of Africa or other forms of foreign adventurism as a way to reinterpret historical accounts. The history presented in Adéagbo’s book is constantly shifting, plural, nonhierarchical, and subversive.",
