  "text": "Tim Lowly explores the most intimate and profound experiences of being alive. Here he has depicted his father and mother and a moment of life transition. His father is on his deathbed and his mother is alone, immersed in nature after the event. Although Lowly based the images on photographs he took at separate times he felt they made sense together and spoke to the myriad feelings he and his family were experiencing in the wake of his father’s death.\r\n\r\nAt 25 was a collaborative work commemorating Lowly’s daughter Temma’s 25th birthday. She has been the subject of his work since birth and he has explored his relationship to her as caregiver and father. Temma was born with severe physical disabilities and the experience has been challenging and powerful for Lowly and his wife. He considers Temma a creative collaborator in his work and invited friends to contribute to this icon to her life.",
