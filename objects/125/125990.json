  "text": "A self-taught artist, Huppler developed a quirky approach to painting and drawing that captivated his better-known contemporaries, which included Paul Cadmus and Andy Warhol. He was inspired to start making visual art as an accompaniment to his creative writing. Eventually his drawings and little paintings on paper took over and Huppler had a successful career as an artist. He made thousands of drawings and paintings on paper in his lifetime and was a prolific and extraordinarily detailed correspondent. His letters to artists and writers, friends and family provide an intimate and hilarious narrative of the mid-twentieth century art world.",
