  "text": "This photograph shows a girl without shoes standing at her doorstep in a poor Southside Chicago neighborhood. Enrolled in the social documentary photography course taught by Aaron Siskind during his senior year at the Institute of Design in Chicago, Yasuhiro Ishimoto captured a moment when the wind slightly blew her skirt, remembering his influential teacher Harry Callahan’s advice of the importance of a photographer’s “willingness simply to let things happen.”",
