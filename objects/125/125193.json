  "text": "Birch Bark Object VIII is an example of Kosonen’s open-weave baskets, essentially a loosely-woven object made of thick strips of Finnish birch bark. From the bottom it appears almost spherical. Kosonen, as a modern wood artist, brings the traditional crafts of Finland—here basketmaking, which is an important tradition that has for centuries produced a crucial household object—together with the contemporary wood art tradition that moves away from the functional object.",
