  "text": "OmniSanti (All Saints) was initially drafted during a trip to the Republic of Georgia, where Clemens-Tobias Lange visited churches dedicated to various saints. The book consists of nine spreads, each focused on a different saint. Intrigued by the sight of people praying in front of smoke-patterned walls, Lange replicated the smoke markings by using a photo-engraving process to produce opaque black and gray marks on the page. According to the artist, OmniSanti is “a book in memory of the ancestors, a book of hope.”",
