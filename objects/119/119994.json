  "text": "Though this image of a tree may initially appear to be a photograph, it is only based on one. Sandra Allen has stripped her subject of color, context, and completeness. Through such reduction, she transforms the tree into an isolated totemic sculptural presence. She leaves us to wonder at all the forces that allowed this tree to grow, to lose its limbs, and to renew itself each year. As we look closer, we see that her hand has shaped all the features that we see, that this powerful physical presence is wrought from countless abstract marks of very soft graphite smeared on the rough surface of a thick sheet of paper.",
