  "text": "1915 marks the birth of the shin hanga movement, spurred on by the publisher Watanabe Shōzaburō (1885–1962). During the spring of that year, Watanabe had seen an exhibition of watercolors by the Austrian Friedrich (Fritz) Capelari (1884-1950). Capelari had produced somewhat subtle, romanticized images of scenic views and local people during his time in China, Java, and Japan. Watanabe surmised that Capelari would be a collaborator in creating a new type of print that would feature the new character of Japan without being too avant-garde. And as Watanabe sought to market images to foreigners in Japan, he reasoned that Capelari would be the ideal artist. Together, they produced a total of twelve designs in 1915 featuring landscapes and beautiful women; this presumably being the first.",
