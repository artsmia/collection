  "text": "Conceptual and performance artist Stan Shellabarger walks as a mode of action-driven expression. Using modest materials and spatially-constrained courses, he creates one-of-a-kind “walking books” that are part performance art and part drawing. For Shellabarger, walking functions both as the method and the content of his work. The hours-long duration of his mark-making activity and the repetitive and rhythmic nature of his movements resemble spiritual and secular forms of meditation, a ritualized exercise that directs awareness inward. As a result, his work is rich with metaphorical connotations, evoking ideas such as temporality, human consciousness, and the cyclical nature of life.\r\n\r\nShellabarger created this unique work by walking a labyrinthine path on two large sheets of rolled paper that he placed side-by-side on the marble floor of Mia's Fountain Court. Wearing graphite-impregnated pads on his shoes, he repeatedly paced his pre-determined routes, marking and abrading the surfaces of the sheets of paper through the recurrent action of his footsteps interacting with the inherent characteristics and imperfections of the century-old marble tile surface. As the product of his body in motion, the residual marks and tracks left on the paper are a tangible record of a single walking performance.",
