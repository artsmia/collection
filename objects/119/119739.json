  "text": "The last sheet depicts a group of figures on a smaller scale with a similar compositional balance as the first sheet. Even though almost everyone is completely nude, the scene is partially innocent depicting men and women of all ages in a public bath house. A young woman at the far left is enjoying a massage, and returning the favor. At the right is a young man who is aroused by the view and to his side is a fully-clothed older man- most likely the proprietor of the house. There were mixed public bath houses until they were banned during the Kansei Reforms (1787-93).",
