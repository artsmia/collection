  "text": "Joel Shapiro is one of the preeminent sculptors of our time and this particular work is one of his most powerfully expressive. Cast in bronze from five rectangular blocks, it captures the feeling of the human body resting on its side. The minimalist qualities of Shapiro’s work reference a vast history of artists working with simple geometric shapes and interpretations of the human form, making this sculpture an excellent complement to our existing collection.",
