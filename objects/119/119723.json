  "text": "A prostitute relaxes with a devoted customer surrounded by gorgeous robes and furnishings. At left is a black and gold lacquer cabinet and portable tobacco set; at right is a panel from screen and sugoroku table. The customer has lavish praise: Your skin is whiter than the reflection of the rising sun on snow, and soft and smooth like white habutae silk. To touch it is indescribable. She encourages him: Oh yes, go deeper into me, and strongly. Hold me tightly. Ooh, ooh, uh, uh.",
