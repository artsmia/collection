  "text": "The painting probably depicts the actor Nakamura Ganjirō II as Manno in the kabuki play Ise ondo koi no netaba (The Ise Dances and Love's Dull Blade). Manno, the chief maid of the brothel Aburaya, is an evil woman. She will be killed by Fukuoka Mitsugi who is the hero of the play. Ganjirō II performed this role in August 1954 at the Kabuki Theater. Apart from this unique painting, Shunsen also created a print of the same subject that was published by Watanabe Shōzaburō.",
