  "text": "A prostitute and her lover frantically make love. He grasps her upper thigh as she braces herself with her foot on a lacquer cabinet beside a folding screen at left. She is relieved to finally be in the arms of her mabu (non-paying lover): Out of all the many men I've slept with, I promised myself deeply to you, and I sneak out to meet you- but when we part my feelings grow even stronger. He reassures her: Endure the hard times and the suffering, and at the end we will be man and wife. Just look forward to that day.",
