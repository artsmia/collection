  "text": "Helena Hernmarck is a contemporary artist and weaver best known for her innovative tapestries, many of which have been site-specific commissions for corporate or public buildings. She designed these tapestries as site-specific artworks for the lobby and atrium of Pitney Bowes’s building in Stamford, Connecticut. There, they were two monumental 40-foot-long tapestries – twice the size of her previous large-scale works. For their installation at the MIA, Hernmarck worked with conservators to reconfigure them as four 20-foot-long tapestries.  \r\n\r\nDeparting from her usual method of using photography for her tapestry designs, Hernmarck began this project with two of her own watercolor paintings. Her intention was that when hung, the tapestries would evoke the impression of wet paint dripping down the building’s expansive walls.",
