  "text": "Originally, banners were used on battlefields for troop identification, but in the Edo period (1603–1868) they were used for more civic purposes. Banners became a central element of the display for Boy's Day on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month. The special day was meant to inspire boys to be disciplined, brave, and honorable, and artists who created banners frequently chose subjects supporting that message. This unique hand-painted banner illustrates Shōki, the powerful demon queller who originated in China, where he became popular in folklore during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong (712–756).",
