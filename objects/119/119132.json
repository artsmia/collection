  "text": "Originally, banners were used on battlefields for troop identification but in the Edo period they developed into ornamental use. Banners became a central element of the display for Boy's Day on the fifth day of the fifth month and were meant to inspire boys to be disciplined, brave and honorable. Artists painted motifs that held symbolic meaning (e.g., carp for determined effort; helmets and armor for martial skill). This banner illustrates Shōki, the powerful demon queller.",
