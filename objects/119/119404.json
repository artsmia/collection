The outstanding English sculptor Flaxman, who also made designs for neo-classical and Renaissance revival silver, in fact, carefully adapted Gothic elements - such as the openwork foliage and the four cast frogs at the nodi - and integrated them into a system of proportions, which is deeply informed by classical and Renaissance architecture and art.",
