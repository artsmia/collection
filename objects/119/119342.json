  "text": "Sherri Smith is a weaver and fiber artist who achieved early critical success after participating in the groundbreaking 1969 exhibition “Wall Hangings” at the Museum of Modern Art in New York – now widely regarded as having established the field of fiber as an art form. “Silver Lining” emerged from a series of formal experiments using sandwiched layers of waffle woven textiles to create three-dimensional objects. Her choice of waffle weave is noteworthy for an artwork because it is often used for industrial textiles or domestic objects like towels and thermal clothing. Although the finished piece can be laid flat and rolled into a bundle, when hung according to specifications gravity tugs at various points to create deep folds and dramatic, cavernous openings. The result is a large-scale, three-dimensional hanging that has an architectural presence.",
