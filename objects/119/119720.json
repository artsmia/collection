  "text": "The lovers lock eyes, he holds a folding fan and she holds folded tissues (onkotogami). At left is a lantern decorated with flowers and at right is a cabinet with books and scrolls. They are comfortable enough with each other to banter while making love. She discusses a jojuri (chanting) lyric which contrasts with her own apparent confidence: “’Embarrassed, the hand clasped underneath the pillow' is a good lyric. He quibbles: This isn't the sort of place to quote jojuri. We're in the middle of a big commotion here. The poem on the fan reads: In the mid-air A little cuckoo crosses, calling- Heralding the end of spring And the poem on the lantern reads: Whoever you are Let me show you The lantern on the eave.",
