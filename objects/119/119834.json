  "text": "At least since they decorated the caves of southern France some 17,000 years ago, artists have enjoyed using red pigments. Drawn from a live model, Domenic Cretara’s study is an exercise in observation. Showing only the woman’s head, neck, and the suggestion of one shoulder, the study exemplifies his skill and sensitivity. Cretara carefully indicated the subtle variations of light and shadow that describe the textures of the model’s head, face, and hair, while deftly capturing the essence of her introspective expression and elegant bearing.",
