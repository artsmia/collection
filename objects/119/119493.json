  "text": "Harri Koskinen’s mission for the HK series of furniture was to create chairs and tables that were not just compact and affordable but well-proportioned and comfortable, too. To minimize production costs, Koskinen limited the number of parts and materials, using a lightweight, graceful birch plywood and veneer suitable for both personal and public settings. The HK 002 lounge chair, following these rational yet elegant principles, is aesthetically attractive, functional, and sturdy enough to hand on to the next generation.",
