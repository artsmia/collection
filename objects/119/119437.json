  "text": "\"Thumbs up (we must be living right)\" was completed by the artist over the course of two years. Drawn directly on paper with pen without the use of an under drawing, this piece epitomizes the busy, clustered scenes that are characteristic of DuCett’s style. The viewer is playfully invited to lean-in and look more closely at the tiny vignettes and small occurrences unfolding within the large and disorderly space of the picture frame. Like an archive or a treasure map, objects, icons, and cultural ephemera are superimposed on the infrastructure of a chaotic cityscape. Sheltering numerous small and mischievously placed symbols and images – including the Minneapolis skyline – \"Thumbs up (we must be living right)\" triggers personal associations and memories in viewers whether they’ve lived in Minneapolis or not.",
