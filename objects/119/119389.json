  "text": "A member of the Denesuline (Dene)/Salteaux people, Alex Janvier says that he “asks permission from the canvas” before beginning his work. Seeking permission from objects, animals, people, and environments before engaging with them is a touchstone of the Dene philosophy, honoring relationships and affirming reciprocal respect between people and those they interact with. The bold lines, shapes, and colors in this image may seem quickly made, but they are deliberate and carefully placed. Turntable Bird reflects Janvier’s deep and ongoing knowledge of landscape and geography. His work also echoes traditional beadwork featuring blossoming flowers.",
