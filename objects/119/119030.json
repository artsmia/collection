  "text": "How wild and ferocious do you have to look? Depends what you’re trying to accomplish. This mask, encrusted with teeth, fur, human hair, and countless protuberances resembling horns or tusks, was used in ceremonies performed to command authority, administer justice, and detect wrongdoers. The little bells added an aural element to the powerful appearance of the mask itself.",
