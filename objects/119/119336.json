  "text": "The Miao are one of China’s largest ethnic minority groups, scattered among several provinces, but mostly living in Guizhou/Yunnan plateau. They are famous for their embroidery skills and indigo dyeing techniques. Styles of Miao costume are diverse among the culture’s various sub-groups. A popular saying states “If you meet one hundred Miaos, you will see one hundred costumes.” \r\n\r\nAprons of this type make use of a kind of “silkworm paper” made by allowing silkworms to accumulate their output of threads on a flat surface, rather than winding it in the form of a cocoon. The resulting silk threads are used for the multi-colored fringe.",
