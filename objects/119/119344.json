  "text": "The Dutch artist Egbert Van Drielst was a noted landscape painter and draftsman. In this skillful black chalk and gray wash drawing, he captures with meticulous precision the gnarled, twisting branches and trunks of the ancient trees in this forest near Haarlem, and the fragmented sunlight that splinters through the trees’ lush canopies on a clear summer day. In the background, a warm, brightly lit patch of grass beckons the viewer into the drawing.",
