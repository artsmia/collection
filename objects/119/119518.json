  "text": "A ceramic figure is seated in a meditative pose—eyes closed, legs crossed, the right over the left and hands resting on the lap with palms up, the right hand resting on the left with thumbs meeting. The figure is bare chested, wearing shorts, and bald. The figure’s form is slender with silver mist-like beads of overglaze covering its body.",
