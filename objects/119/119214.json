  "text": "Considered one of the world’s great masters of contemporary sculpture, Tony Cragg has taken a highly inventive approach to materials and form since he first appeared on the scene in the late 1970s. Pulse represents both his formal and technical brilliance. Made from kerto, a wood supplement commonly used in housing construction, the sculpture complements the museum’s strong collection of decorative, industrial, and craft-based works. Cragg’s sculpture transforms this new type of construction material beyond its initial intentions into an outstanding work of art.",
