  "text": "Georgia O’Keeffe, one of the most admired American Modernist painters of the 1900s, drew inspiration from the landscape of the American Southwest. Among her favorite places to paint was a site she called “the Black Place,” in the Bisti Badlands in Navajo country, a barren stretch of weathered hills that O’Keeffe said looked like “a mile of elephants” from a distance.",
