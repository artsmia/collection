  "text": "Japanese philosophy asserts that there are five elements: earth, wind, water, fire, and void. Elements II evokes water and void. It is an example of Matsushima’s body jewelry that evolved into a wall installation because the artist eliminated from the design the feature that would make it wearable. She spent six months producing this wavy work of hemp cloth lacquered in the kanshitsu technique; metal wire on the underside strengthens the construction.",
