  "text": "This minimalist tile—a spoon rising from its surface—is one of many explorations of impressions in Kivivirta’s mostly two-dimensional tile work. It is a notable example of how her tiles provide interest and variety for interiors, following in the artistic tile traditions of the Netherlands in the 1600s to 1700s and Britain in the 1800s.",
