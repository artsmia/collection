  "text": "For this monumental work, Nakaigawa Yuki imagines the coming together of a group of cells, which will soon divide again, a momentary occurrence referenced in the title. Nakaigawa built each cell using the coil technique before adding texture to their surfaces with her fingers and small tools, covering them in numerous layers of slip (liquid clay), and then firing them. The ten pieces are connected by bolts hidden from view. Nakaigawa has said that her fascination with nature began when she collected stones and displayed them in her room as a child. Her artistic practice remains rooted in observation of nature and attempts to recreate the shapes, forms, and energies she discovers there. Many of her large-scale works have involved this kind of assemblage of smaller forms that appear on the verge of collapse or separation.",
