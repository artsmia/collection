  "text": "Little Red Book #123 is a collection of Polaroids of members of Andy Warhol’s life and social circle. Some are known celebrities, others part of New York’s active art and club scene in the 1970s.  Warhol produced more than forty thousand Polaroids between 1970 and 1987. A small number of these images were organized by Warhol himself into more than one hundred Red Books. The twenty images here document the life and world of an artist in a way that challenges the notions of the carefully framed and lit portraits expected by the photography tradition.",
