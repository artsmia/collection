  "text": "Hunting Caribou from Kayaks exemplifies Luke Anguhadluq’s ability to capture Inuit ways of understanding and depicting their world. This particular drawing is the rendering of a caribou hunt as they migrated seasonally, even crossing large waters. Four tents that depict the Inuit campsite are shown near where the hunters deploy their kayaks. At the age of 73 and no longer able to hunt, Luke Anguhadluq moved to Baker Lake, in Nunavet Territory, Canada, and began drawing the physical and cultural landscapes of his community. Anguhadluq focused on the daily and ceremonial life of the Inuit, full of culturally important details from his years observing and participating.",
