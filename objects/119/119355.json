  "text": "This rug, with its bold design in black and green, has a strikingly modernist feel to it. It represents the innovative approach of contemporary women weavers in Morocco. Since the 1970s, a new style developed in both rural areas and small urban centers: so-called “rag rugs” made in part of recycled fabric—often remnants of used clothes.",
