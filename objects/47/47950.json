Philip holds a staff in the form of a cross in accordance with the tradition that he preached while crucified upside down. \r\n\r\nVan Meckenem often made prints based on designs by other artists. This engraving follows now-lost drawings by Hans Holbein, the elder, and recalls decorations on the exterior of altarpieces, where the paintings are made to look like sculptures.",
