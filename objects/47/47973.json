  "text": "The horror of John the Baptist's murder is heightened by Israhel van Meckenem's novel inversion. Only when we look past the seemingly benign courtly festivities do we detect the evil machinations of Salome and her mother, Herodias. At upper left, Salome receives the Baptist's head on a platter, and at upper right she presents it to her mother. In legend, Herodias proceeds to pierce the Baptist's tongue as shown here, further revenge for his harsh words.",
