  "text": "To make Christ's persecution real and present, pictures began to show the resurrected figure dead yet alive--standing, eyes usually open, and displaying the wounds of the Crucifixion. Beholders were meant to understand that Christ's Passion was ongoing, forever requiring their ardent devotion. This Man of Sorrows is timeless yet palpable, a figure who is at once divine and convincingly human. ",
