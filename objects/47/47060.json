  "text": "The foliage in this mock coat of arms shows Albrecht Dürer's brilliant handling of pure ornament. Scholar Charles W. Talbot cited this print as evidence that history probably lost its greatest goldsmith when Dürer became an artist instead of a goldsmith like his father. This level of ornamental abandon was rarely, if ever, repeated in Dürer's oeuvre.",
