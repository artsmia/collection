The prints are large in format and depict incredibly elaborate and deep spaces, often with complicated views into adjoining rooms. In this scene, Judas kisses Christ to identify him to the soldiers and servants of the high priests. At the left, Saint Peter cuts off the ear of Malchus in an attempt to save Christ.",
