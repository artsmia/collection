  "text": "Dormeyer’s “Silver Chef” stand mixer of 1954 retailed for $52.50-the equivalent of almost $500 today. It featured 10 speeds and came with two push release beaters, two mixing bowls and juicing and meat grinding attachments. After use, the mixer could be buffed “into shiny brightness in a jiffy” and the stainless steel bowls effortlessly wiped clean, important considerations for a countertop appliance.",
