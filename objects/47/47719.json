  "text": "Legend has it that an executive in the teens was heard to say about an early electric mixer, \"I don't care what you call it, all I know, it's the best kitchen aid I've ever had.\" The name stuck. The first five-quart countertop Kitchen Aid mixers we're expensive: $189.50, or about $2,000 in 2002 dollars. Weighing in at 65 pounds, they weren't convenient either. But that all changed in 1936 when pioneering industrial designer Egmont Ahrens trimmed the mixer down and reduced the price to $55. The Kitchen Aid may have been the first, but the widespread acceptance of the electric standing mixer actually belongs to a more populist-priced appliance, the Sunbeam Mix Master, and later, the gleaming \"Silver-Chef\" of the late 1950s.",
