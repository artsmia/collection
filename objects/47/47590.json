  "text": "Charles-Emile Jacque has been termed the \"Raphael of Pigs,\" a name he probably would not have minded. His nearly 500 prints are filled with images of swine and poultry. He was among the group of French artists drawn to the bucolic village of Barbizon, outside Paris. In The Mill, one of the relatively few Jacque prints devoid of farm animals, the artist shows his fascination with atmospheric effects. By leaving a film of ink on the plate before printing, he was able to enhance the feel of his velvety drypoint lines. He liked small plates like the one used to make this print because he could carry them with him as he walked the land and make etchings from nature.",
