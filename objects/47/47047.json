  "text": "This tiny engraving treats a theme related to the large woodcut, Knight on Horseback and the Lansquenet (see 2016.108.2) that Albrect Dürer made about the same time. Here a gallant young messenger brandishes his whip to speed along a country road. His fashionable, tailored clothes tell us he is well paid for his services, and the fluttering plume in his fur cap tells us he hopes the girls will notice.",
