  "text": "Saint Ottilia was the daughter of a duke of Alsace in the 7th century. Because she was born blind, her father planned to have her murdered. However, her mother placed her in a Benedictine monastery, near Besançon, where the infant was baptized and miraculously regained her vision. She later became the abbess of a convent near Strassburg which she founded.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of her malicious father, she prayed so hard for the redemption of his soul that he was released from Purgatory. In this composition, Ottilia kneels and prays while an angel helps her father to arise from his tomb. She is the patron saint of opticians and is invoked for the deliverance of souls.",
