  "text": "During the 1450s van Meckenem's generally stiff technique became freer, and he began achieving greater pictorial effects in his delicately modeled figures within regular silhouettes.  Through his collaboration with the painter Hans Holbein the Elder (1460/65-1534), van Meckenem's work acquired a certain monumentality, and his engravings after Holbein represent the earliest example in Germany of an engraver reproducing a painter's drawings.",
