  "text": "Hieronymus Baumgärtner is known to some as the man Katharina von Bora fancied before marrying reformer Martin Luther. A diplomat, humanist, and bibliophile, Baumgärtner belonged to the patriciate of Nuremberg, Germany. His bookplate includes his coat of arms, but why a clock, hourglass, and skull—the usual symbols of death? It’s possible he wanted to negate any pridefulness associated with his social standing and large library.",
