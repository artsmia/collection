  "text": "Olive Craster, an heiress from a distinguished family, and husband George embarked on an expensive and extensive period of travel across France and Italy shortly after their marriage, throughout which Olive kept meticulous notes of her purchases, including clothes and other fashionable accessories. As a testament to female expression and experience in the eighteenth century, Dance’s portrait is a rare, almost singular survival. Mia’s collection is also weak in British 18th century portraiture, and this picture is a very welcome enhancement.",
