  "text": "This painting depicts two young ladies, one sitting with a book in her hand and the other standing behind her, pointing to a line in the book. Their accessories and luxurious clothing suggest that they are high-status women from the imperial court or other upper level of society. The painting is drawn in a realistic manner, and the artist’s skill can be seen in the delicate rendering of the textile design, hair ornaments, and fluid lines of the drapery. As a result, it provides valuable information about elite women’s fashion and accessories, providing a document of sorts of the material culture of the time.",
