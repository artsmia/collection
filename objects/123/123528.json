  "text": "Among the Dogon peoples of Mali, the birth of twins is a special event. Twins receive specific names, they are completely shaved when presented for the first time to relatives and neighbors, and a small house shrine is made for the father to perform rituals. This twin shrine consists of a clay basis with two small depressions for the offerings. The male and female wooden sculptures represent the twins and are empowered by pieces of bent iron in the shape of the handle of a hoe. Once a year, during communal ceremonies, the twin shrine is brought out of the house for offerings of millet paste and chicken blood.",
