  "text": "Societies in northeastern Nigeria make vessels to represent, embody, and contain spirit forces. Sacred ceramics are used in ancestor worship, healing the sick, protecting hunters, identifying thieves, and more generally for ensuring agricultural success and community well-being. This elegant pot represents the spirit Ngum-Ngumi, a culture hero who led the Ga’anda peoples in their migration from the east and continues to protect them. The vessel is delicately humanized, with arms, breasts, a navel, and designs of body scarification.",
