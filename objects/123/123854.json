  "text": "In this pair of screens, Kyōgen actors perform two comic plays. The left screen depicts a scene from Fuku no kami (“God of Good Luck”) during which the god, shown in red at the left, descends to earth for a night of frolicking at New Year's. The right screen portrays a scene from the skit Suehirogari (“The Fan of Felicity”), in which the young country bumpkin and servant Tarō-kaja, shown at the left, holds the umbrella he has been tricked into buying instead of the fan his master requested. The four men in a row provide the musical accompaniment of drums.",
