  "text": "Jesse, Dover Burial Park, Dover, Ohio, 2012 is a powerful image of an aged World War II veteran. This is a compelling history lesson in a single frame. It is a stark reminder of time’s passage and a disappearing generation of Americans who went to war to fight against fascism and tyranny in Europe during WWII. This photograph strengthens the Mia’s holdings of works by Alec Soth, as well as our collection of documentary photographs. As a Minnesota-based artist and an internationally renowned photographer, Soth is a rare talent whose photographs the Mia has sought to collect in-depth.",
