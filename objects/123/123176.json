  "text": "Wang Qinyun, a renowned woman poet and painter of the late 18th century, painted\r\nfifteen scenes of children at play in garden settings in this album. The children’s activities include riding on bamboo horses, playing gambling games, performing acrobatics, exercising archery, performing ritualistic parades, playing grass games, bird fighting, playing board games, skipping robe, staging scenes of the success in civil service examination, fishing, enjoying antiquities, fighting, attending school, and building a snowman. These paintings reveal a firm grasp of minute details in the depictions of the children, and even the garden scenes are exceptionally depicted. The colophons accompanying each painting were written by contemporary or later writers, poets and calligraphers. They provide valuable additional information not found in the painting proper.",
