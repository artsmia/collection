  "description": "Romanesque relief-carved stone Calvary group showing Christ on the cross between standing figures of the Virgin Mary on the left and St. John the Evangelist on the right; Christ appears with a perizonium around his waist, his legs buckling to the left and his head raised but with heavy eyelids; Mary's hair is covered by a simple veil which encloses her left elbow and is held in her right hand, looking down, with her left hand raised to her face; Mary's mantle clings to her legs in a series of \"damp fold\" drapery swirls, and ruffles over her pointed shoes; John holds a book in the crook of his left arm, and with his right hand (fingers now missing) gestures up towards the body of Christ; John's bare feet protrude from under a long garment with a crinkled neckline; just visible above the surviving section of the patibulum of the cross are two small, rounded shapes that most likely formed the tips of a wing, presumably of an angel; five metal pins at top of lower portion for secure installation of heads of John and Mary and torso and head of Christ",

  "text": "Jesus is seen dead on the cross while his mother, Mary, and his favorite disciple, the Evangelist Saint John, mourn below. This large-scale work embodies the characteristics of Romanesque sculpture in the Medieval period, with its massive and heavy stylized bodies, calligraphic depiction of hair, and linear, energetic approach to rendering the folds of the fabric. This somber group was made around 1180 for a church in northern Spain or southern France, probably along the Catholic pilgrimage route to Santiago de Compostela, in Spain. Installed above a doorway or on a decorative column, it likely stirred the hearts of thousands of religious travelers. To acquire a highly important work of Medieval art has long been identified as a primary objective in Miaâ€™s Collections Development Plan. This work also helps build up our collection of Spanish sculptures.",
