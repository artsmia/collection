  "text": "This tapestry panel and its companion, 91.136.7 Telephone, from Lunning Farm triptych, are small in size and depict everyday subjects: a telephone and a chair. They once belonged to a series of three “woven snapshots” inspired by elements in the rural New York home of the Lunning family. The Lunnings were owners of the Georg Jensen store in New York City, which sold high-end modern Scandinavian designs. The artist Helena Hernmarck, a tapestry weaver of Swedish origin who resides in Connecticut, was a close friend of the Lunnings. By the time she made these panels in the 1970s, Hernmarck had established herself as an artist-weaver who created monumental tapestries for corporate offices. The series was an exceptional project both for its miniature size and personal resonance.",
