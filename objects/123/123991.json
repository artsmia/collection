  "text": "Arnaldo Pomodoro is a prominent Italian sculptor, printmaker, and set designer best known for his inventive interpretations of basic geometric forms such as the column, sphere, disc, cube, and pyramid. As in this lithograph of 1970 featuring multiple views of a severed column, Pomodoro depicts his architectonic motifs as if in stages of ruin and regeneration. His themes are meant to evoke the passage of time, linking the ancient past with the modern present. The subject of this print was derived from Pomodoro’s monumental stainless steel sculpture Colonna Intera Recisa (1969), which also features a severed column motif. Like many of his works, the depiction possesses a discordant tension that Pomodoro called “a unity composed of incompleteness.” He perceives his work in terms of a visual/written language that explores the human condition.",
