Her right arm is outstretched, and she holds a wad of white paper in her hand, preparing to catch a spider that dangles from a single web strand. Katsukawa Shunshō exerted a significant influence on the development of ukiyo-e prints and paintings in the later 18th century and beyond; he also founded the Katsukawa school of artists that dominated the field of actor prints in particular up until the 1790s.",
