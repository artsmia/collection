  "text": "A beautiful, elegantly dressed woman stands with her back to a red\r\nlacquered lantern. Her right arm is stretched out and she holds a wad of\r\nwhite paper in her hand, preparing to catch a spider that dangles from a\r\nsingle web strand. Katsukawa Shunsho- exerted a significant influence\r\non the development of ukiyo-e prints and paintings in the later 18th\r\ncentury and beyond: he also founded the Katsukawa school of artists\r\nthat dominated the field of actor prints in particular up until the 1790s.\r\nShunsho- was a prolific painter, and over one hundred paintings are\r\nknown to have survived. Here, he masterfully accentuates this calm\r\nscene by decorating only the bottom section of the woman’s robe and\r\nshowing only the white tips of her left fingers and toes.\r\nThe artist’s red kao- mark that follows his signature is in a style\r\nregistered as C1 and is similar to that found on an egoyomi (calendar\r\nprint) dating from 1783.",
