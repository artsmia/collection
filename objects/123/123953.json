  "text": "In Tom Hammick’s unique woodcut Tank, a solitary figure observed from behind stands before an industrial storage tank beneath a star-filled night sky. The print’s limited palette and simplified formal arrangement typify Hammick’s minimalist approach, one in which the dreamlike landscape serves as the setting for a metaphorical consideration of the human condition. The lone figure is a symbolic stand-in for human experience. We observe from a distance while the man peers at the night landscape, as if in silent dialogue with his surroundings. Like a poem or a piece of music, Hammick’s abstracted landscape possesses a deep emotional resonance that is at once familiar and mysterious",
