  "text": "What might dark matter look like'  This is the question that artist and master printmaking Keith Taylor takes up in his portfolio of twenty black and white photogravures titled Dark Matter.  Specifically, he investigates a hypothetical and invisible form of matter that many scientists believe makes up the majority of the mass in the universe.\r\n\r\nTo come to terms with dark matter, Taylor photographs shadows inside the CDMS II \r\n[Cryomatic Dark Matter Search] lab in Soudan, MN and the forest around the site where dark matter is studied.  Combining his printing and photographic artistry to produce evocative shadowy images, Taylor imagines what this mysterious dark matter might look like if it were visible",
