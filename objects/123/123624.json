  "text": "One of Tim Harding’s long-term clients, Marvel Larson Norton, commissioned this coat. She requested a snake motif because Harding frequently used layered, vibrant iridescent silks, and these reminded her of snake skins. The shape of the coat takes its cues from traditional Japanese kimono, a persistent form in Harding’s wearable works of art.",
