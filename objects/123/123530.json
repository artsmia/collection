  "text": "Inspired by Pop Art and her Santa Clara pottery tradition, Susan Folwell creates sculptural works of clay that seem to both defy gravity and our expectations of Native American art. A part of a renowned family of Santa Clara potters, Folwell’s ceramics serve as the canvas for her painting. In Pop Art fashion, Folwell incorporates images and ideas from popular culture out of context from theirusual places, creating a sense of irony, whimsy and providing incisive commentary.",
