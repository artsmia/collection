  "text": "A noted American Pop artist, Nicholas Krushenick had by the early 1960s perfected his mature style of abstraction characterized by thick black outlines enclosing shapes of flat, brilliant color in a non-perspectival space. As seen in this print of 1970-71, he maintained the formal language of pure abstraction while employing an illustrative pictorial style marked by stark figure-ground contrasts that suggest the cartoon-like imagery associated with comic books and early Pop art. It was this melding of abstraction and the Pop aesthetic that first earned Krushenick attention from critics and curators. Krushenick attributed the cut-out collages of Matisse as a major influence on his mature style.",
