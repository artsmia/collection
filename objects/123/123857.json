  "text": "This screen belongs to a set of four equally sized screens dedicated to the four seasons. The fallen ginkgo leaves refer to winter. The large pile of leaves—painted in various mineral and metallic pigments, including gold paint and gold leaf—serves as the focus of the composition, but look more closely and you will find ladybugs, lizards, and other small critters moving among the leaves. According to Kanbe, the depiction of nature and living creatures with their small life dramas refers to the hardships of modern life. The unique appearance of Kanbe’s paintings derives from the artist’s layering technique. The bottom layer usually is painted on hemp paper, while the middle and top layers consist of ultrathin Japanese paper called tengujōshi. Thus the leaves actually overlap one another, just as they do in nature.",
