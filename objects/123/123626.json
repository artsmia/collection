  "text": "Artist Tim Harding works primarily with textiles, which he modifies through a unique method of reverse appliqué – a process of layering several pieces of cloth, then stitching, cutting, and fraying or otherwise “distressing” the fabric. In this vest, Harding has cut through multiple sections of layered cloth entirely, resulting in a lace-like structure with large openings. Harding regards his creative process as one that is fundamentally destructive, and designed to challenge our tendencies to treat textiles as fragile, precious.",
