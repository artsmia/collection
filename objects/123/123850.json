  "text": "This pair depicts the Daoist immortals, Gama Sennin (Chin. Liu Hai) and Tekkai Sennin (Chin. Li Tieguai). The two were often paired in Japanese and Chinese art because of their corresponding supernatural powers. Depicted on the left is Gama Sennin, known literally as the ‘toad hermit,’ a character based on the historical civil servant and alchemist Liu Hai of 10th-century China. Various accounts associate Gama with a large, three-legged toad by which he can be identified. Tekkai Sennin was thought to be capable of leaving his body, captured here as he is exhaling his spirit from his mouth. Like Gama Sennin, he is associated with medicine, and is traditionally represented with a gourd that signifies his ability to transcend the body and to offer healing.",
