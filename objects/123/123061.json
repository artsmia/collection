  "text": "Untitled #181 is one of several works in Simen Johan’s series Until the Kingdom Come. Each photograph in the series documents a different animal in its natural habitat. Despite the realistic nature of these photos, the animals and backgrounds are composites of multiple images taken in various places and then carefully stitched together to produce one ideal, manufactured image.",
