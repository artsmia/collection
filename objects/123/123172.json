  "text": "Wang Qinyun, a renowned woman poet and painter of the late 18th century, painted 15 scenes of children at play in garden settings in this album. Children at play—and especially young boys, as seen here—was a common theme in Chinese art for centuries. These scenes expressed a social desire at the time for families to have talented, educated children who would grow up to support their families. These joyous scenes of childhood also express a sense of peace and harmony and the wonders of childhood innocence.",
