  "text": "Though made of cotton, this one-of-a-kind coat was sturdy enough to keep its owner warm though the Minnesota winter. Multiple layers of cloth have been frayed, poked through, and gathered. The result is reminiscent of smocking—an embroidery technique that was traditionally used in the United States and Europe to gather sections of fabric before the invention of elastic—but on a much larger scale.",
