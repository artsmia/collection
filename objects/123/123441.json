  "text": "Anteaters are found in Central and South America, where they lick up lots and lots of ants. Ray French engraved this image while he was a student at the University of Iowa. Through the years, French’s interests would lead him to explore figural abstraction and hard-edge geometric abstraction, but when he made this he was a mid-20th-century modernist applying his freedom of execution to an offbeat, yet traditional subject.",
