  "text": "Death has been a subject of fascination for artists since the Middle Ages—its universality and omnipresence, its frightful nature, and its inevitable, and often unforeseen arrival for all. Here Nicolas Eekman treats the subject in seven haunting images, cramming his woodcuts with chilling imagery. Each depicts a terrifying bird or winged creature who has chosen a new victim to torment—men and women, oblivious and mindful, young and old—no one is spared.",
