  "text": "Celebrated for his depictions of monkeys, Mori Sosen also excelled at capturing the character of other animals. This painting shows a group of three raccoon dogs (tanuki). The naturalistic posing, one scratching itself, seemingly listening, one directly staring at the viewer and the third open-mouthed with its tongue extended, illuminates Sosen’s personal observations of these wild animals. This may be an interpretation of the Chinese proverb typically illustrating monkeys gesturing “Hear no evil, see no evil, and speak no evil.”",
