  "text": "Arne Jacobsen’s Ant chair is an insect-inspired take on molded plywood furniture. The one-piece plywood form is bent below its “waist” (or, in insect terms, between thorax and abdomen), allowing for flexibility and better comfort in a simple, lightweight, stackable chair with a pleasing organic form. This three-legged version was the first iteration of the Ant—though it was perfectly stable, it was upgraded to four legs in the second version.",
