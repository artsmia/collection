  "text": "This coverlet was made in Bergen County, New Jersey in 1837 for Sarah Durie, probably in celebration of her marriage. It incorporates imagery that was common among Bergen County coverlets. Coverlets consisted of two integrated layers of cloth and were very complicated to weave. Their production was stimulated by evolving loom technology – including the Jacquard loom, now regarded as a precursor to the modern computer – and the immigration of skilled weavers from Western Europe. Though coverlets were common through much of the Eastern and Midwestern US, immigrant weavers brought their design preferences with them and pockets of regionally-distinct styles soon developed.",
