  "text": "Contemporary Navajo artist D.Y. Begay created Blessing of Rain to celebrate 2015’s summer of abundant rains and vegetation in Navajo country. Using plants and natural wools from her community of Tselani within the Navajo Nation, Begay creates distinctive textiles that reveal the cultural and natural landscapes in which she lives. Her most recent work combines superior technique with her signature horizontal undulating waves of color. More than ten shades of green and light mustard hues appear from the natural dyes of hollyhocks, coreopsis, Navajo tea, and chamisa.",
