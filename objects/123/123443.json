  "text": "Shen Zongjing, a scholar-official painter of the early 1700s, preferred painting mountains and streams in monochrome, a manner favored by the literati artists. His works were considered to express lofty thought through his powerful brush strokes. This type of landscape painting is known as chenghuai weidao or “purifying one’s mind to savor Dao. Here, the term Dao refers to the essence of the phenomena embodied in nature, or more specifically, mountains. Such paintings always portray one or several seated gentlemen, gazing into the distant mountains and water falls, with the mountains seeming to gaze back at them. It is through such communion between human and nature that an awakening, a purge, a sublime transcendence of mortal bounds is sensed.",
