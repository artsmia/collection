  "text": "Shen Zongjing, a scholar-official painter of the early 1700s, preferred painting mountains and streams in monochrome, a manner favored by other scholar-artists. His works were considered to express lofty thought through his powerful brushstrokes. This type of landscape painting is known as chenghuai weidao, or “purifying one’s mind to savor Dao.” Here, the term “Dao” refers to the essence of the phenomena embodied in nature, or, more specifically, mountains. Such paintings always portray one or several seated gentlemen gazing into the distant mountains and waterfalls. It is through such communion between human and nature that an awakening, a purge, a sublime transcendence of mortal bounds is sensed.",
