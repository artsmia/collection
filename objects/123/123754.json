  "text": "German-born Katje Oxman retains childhood memories of a country deeply scarred by war. Her art presents a hermetic world of more serene reverie embodied by natural objects, prints, and postcards of art laid out on the vibrant background of a geometric oriental rug. She produces her luscious images through a painstaking process involving four precisely etched and aquatinted copper plates inked with semi-transparent colors printed in perfect registration.",
