  "text": "Hannelore Baron was an internationally recognized German modern artist acclaimed for her highly evocative mixed-media work in collage and assemblage. Born in 1926 to Jewish parents, she and her family endured significant hardships in the 1930s under Germany’s oppressive Nazi regime. Along with her family, she immigrated to America in 1941. Her work is a reaction to her humanistic concerns which, while they have their origins in the hardships endured as an adolescent in Germany in the 1930’s, dealt with current issues. The collages are paper and frayed cloth with drawing, at times containing her printed images, stitching, creasing and tearing. Her assemblages often incorporated her collages, found objects, wood, paint, strings, and the like.",
