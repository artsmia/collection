  "text": "The contrast of textile techniques from all over the world is a recurrent theme in Minnesota-based artist Tim Harding’s creations. The silhouette of this coat is reminiscent of traditional Japanese kimono. But the raised pile elements—developed through Harding’s unique method of reverse appliqué, which involves layering, then cutting and fraying the fabric—are evocative of luxurious Italian velvets.",
