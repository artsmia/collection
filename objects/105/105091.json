  "text": "One column of monks heads out to collect alms, while another returns. Are these two different groups, or the same one at different times? The figures, all depicted in a simplified manner, wear the typical begging outfit of a dark-colored kimono, white leg protectors, and straw hat; the first and last ones hold walking sticks. They would have also worn straw sandals. This subject of processing begging monks was first painted by the Zen monk Nantenbō (1839-1925). He executed multiple variations of the painting, as did his students like Deiryū, a version of which is seen here.",
