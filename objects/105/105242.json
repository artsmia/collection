  "text": "Hsu Lin, calligrapher, painter, poet and songwriter was born in Nanjing into the landed gentry class. He was a natural and precocious talent, highly popular, unconventional, physically attractive, a true hedonist, and friend of the Zhengde Emperor (1426-1435). On the occasion of his seventieth birthday over a hundred song girls came to the party. The festive occasions appropriate to Hsu Lin's idiosyncratic writing of Tu Fu's (712-770) famous drinking song poem shown here is easily imagined. Under the influence of wine the text was energetically scripted for an elite, well educated, audience as a type of extemporaneous performance art.  It was a form of cultural activity that barely exists today. Hsu's poem is written in a bold, large format <I>ts'ao-shu</I> (grass script) using a dry stubby brush. The poem The Eight Immortals of the Wine Cup is based on the Eight Sages, an actual Tang dynasty wine-drinking coterie comprised of a prince, a monk, high officials, and well-known poets.  \r\n \r\nSome of the verse about the wine immortals reads as follows:\r\n\r\n<P><I>Prince Ju-yang must have three quarts before he appears in court, <P>and if he encounters a vintner's cart he begins to salivate, <P>wishing he could be re-enfeoffed in the Province of the Wine-Stream!\r\n\r\n<P>Li-Po writes a hundred poems for every quart he drinks;\r\n<P>Then goes to sleep right in the wine shops in Ch'ang'an!\r\n<P>If the Emperor summons him; he refuses to get into the boat proclaiming, I, your subject, am actually an Immortal of Wine.\r\n\r\n<P>Chang Hsu drinks just three cups and demonstrates why he's called the Sage of Cursive Script;\r\n<P>He casts off his cap, exposing his pate right in front of the princes.\r\n<P>He twirls his brush, drops it to the paper, producing cloud and mist!\r\n\r\n<P>Chiao Sui requires five quarts before he perks up to bring forth noble discourse and heroic debate, amazing all the guests at the party.</I>",
