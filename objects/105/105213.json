  "text": "Norman Ives was an important painter, printmaker, designer, publisher, and teacher who taught at the Yale University School of Art in the 1950s and 60s. Ives was a member of the first graphic design class at Yale, studying under the pioneering German-born artist Josef Albers. \r\n\r\nIves developed a style of painting and graphic design that relied heavily on the use of typography and fragmenting letterforms as compositional elements within abstract images. In this, he was strongly influenced by the  use of photomontage in commercial art.",
