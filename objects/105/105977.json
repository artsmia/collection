  "text": "Upon walking into this White Castle restaurant, Thomas Arndt noticed two things: the light falling on a man’s back and torso and the reflection in the mirror of a cigarette  vending machine. Arndt quickly composed the image, knowing it was a fleeting moment. Through the windows at right and left, there are glimpses of the corner of Fourth Street and Central Avenue SE in Minneapolis.  Today, the White Castle and the Washburn-McReavy Funeral Home are no longer there. Arndt’s photograph, however, depicts a moment in the city’s everyday life.",
