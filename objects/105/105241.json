  "text": "In the third century CE, during a time of social and political upheaval, a group of literati men withdrew into nature, opting for a life of drinking wine and engaging in music, poetry, and scholarly discussions. Known as the “Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove, ” these men represent the desire to pursue individual expression and freedom rather than serve a corrupt government.\r\n\r\nSu Renshan’s paintings are known for their sparse calligraphic brushwork and simple compositions that defied academic painting traditions. Here, he interpreted the Seven Sages with nearly cartoonish brevity. He omitted the bamboo grove entirely to focus on the figures themselves.",
