Boerner, Paris and New York; sold to Dayton]; Ruth and Bruce Dayton, Wayzata, Minn.; given to MIA, 2008.\r\n\r\nNote from Armin Kunz: Our Denis proof set comes  from Petiet, and we do not know where he acquired it. The Petiet collection is much older than the Josefowitz collection. We know that all the handwritten annotations must have been done by Denis and were intended for Clot, the printer. It is likely that the printer held onto these proofs and kept them (rather than giving them back to the artist).\r\n\r\nBut this is not certain, as there are no stamps or documents that prove this contention.",
