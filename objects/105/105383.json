  "text": "A millennia old art form, Plains Indian drawings appear on rocks, hides, muslin, cloth, and paper. Drawings can depict a variety of subjects, including great accomplishments of individual men, important historical events, and ceremonial and daily life on the Plains. Cheyenne artist William Cohoe made this sketchbook--illustrating his life before and during captivity--while a prisoner of war at Ft. Marion, Florida between 1875 and 1878. Offering a glimpse into the artists' world, these drawings provide rich information about Cheyenne perspectives and aesthetic sensibilities.",
