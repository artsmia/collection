  "text": "Traditionally, embroidered dresses are an essential part of a young Bedouin woman's marriage trousseau. Before puberty she creates at least seven embroidered dresses, one for each day of the week of her wedding, which is punctuated by a series of rituals and ceremonies. On the third day, the bride dons a white dress elaborately embroidered with a multitude of motifs in auspicious colors.\r\n\r\nBedouin wedding dresses function as a public display of a woman's merit in her ability as an embroiderer and the wealth she brings to the marriage. Today fashion, trade, and individual choice have transformed this tradition. The embellishments on this particular dress suggest that it was made for commercial exchange.",
