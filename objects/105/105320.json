  "text": "Water molecules are composed of one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms. The electrons that bind the molecule together create a \"V\" shape, two hydrogen atoms at the top and the oxygen at the bottom. This also creates a polarized or magnetic charge in the molecule, positive on top and negative on the bottom. When molecules fall to earth they allign and stick together along their polar axies, solidifying as they freeze.Changes in temperature and humidity and collisions with other snowflakes change the exact pattern of each flake as it is built, but because of the molecules matching \"V\" shapes and magnetic properties they align themselves in six sided symmetry. The repeated process of individual molecules attaching together in a patterned yet somewhat random style illustrates the basic principles of fractal geometry.",
