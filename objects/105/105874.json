  "text": "This pouch depicts an image of the Underwater Panther, an important spiritual force among many tribes in the Great Lakes/Woodlands region. The Underwater Panther lives in lakes, streams, and rivers; whirlpools are created when it moves its long tail. To the right and left of this label are two bandolier bags. Some bags feature designs that pay respect to the Underwater Panther. Along each side of the central panel on the bandolier bags is a vertical beaded design element, blue on the bag to the left, and blue/green on the bag to the right. This vertical design symbolizes the whirlpools made by the Underwater Panther.",
