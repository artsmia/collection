  "text": "Many Meskwaki and other Great Lakes artistic creations stem from a belief in “Manitous, ” supernatural beings who help anyone who appropriately seeks their services. This pouch depicts one kind of Manitou: an Underwater Panther. An important spiritual force, these powerful and potentially dangerous beings could disrupt the waters with their long and sometimes jagged tails, pulling people beneath the surface. The points on the head are horns, not ears.",
