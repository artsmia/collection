  "text": "A weathervane such as this was made by placing sheet metal (often copper or zinc) over a hand-carved wooden form and hammering it down to take on the curves of the wooden shape. In the 1800s, A. L. Jewell & Company was one of the earliest manufacturers to capitalize on the popularity of weathervanes in the United States. The Jumping Horse form was made in small numbers, for only about three years. The horse jumping through a hoop is the rarest.",
