  "text": "Located throughout the Plains and Upper Midwest and into Canada, the Potawatomi have an artistic tradition similar to that of the Anishinabe, and both tribes made bandolier bags.  According to traditional stories, the Potawatomi are related to the Anishinabe.  This object is a classic example of a Potawatomi bandolier bag.  Characteristics of the style are symmetrical straps, a large loom-beaded central panel, and repeat patterning.  This bandolier bag was probably made by the band of the Potawatomi located in Michigan.",
