  "text": "Seymour Haden had a successful medical career, but he is better known for his avocation—etching. He and his younger brother-in-law James McNeill were leaders in the British Etching Revival, which saw a resurgence in the use of etching as a creative medium. Haden wrote of the vivacity of the etched line, and even in this small landscape, one sees variety in his touch, from the vibrating strokes in the architecture to the fine slashes that define the sky. On the tavern is a sign for the West London Rowing Club, which was active until 1887. The scene is at Mortlake, a London suburb on the Thames River and a major venues for regattas.",
