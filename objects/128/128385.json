  "text": "Merging aspects of photography and sculpture, Christiane Feser cuts, folds, and manipulates two-dimensional photographs of constellations into unique relief-like works that bring material and image into perfect balance. In this example from the series Partitionen (Partitions), Feser deftly explores questions of perception, spatial illusion, and the generation of meaning. At once playful and conceptually challenging, Feser’s construction demands close inspection and quiet observation to fully appreciate its latent visual and perceptual potential.",
