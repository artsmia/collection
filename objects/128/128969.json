  "text": "Minnesota-based artist Mary Giles was known for “baskets” that assumed sculptural, closed forms. Copper Passage is a superb example of Giles’s “boulder” sculptures. She started making these in 1999 after having work done on her Stillwater, Minnesota, home, which rested on a cluster of boulders. When workers excavated the large rocks, one of them broke in half. Giles was captivated by the split rock, and how the color of its “skin” contrasted with its core.",
