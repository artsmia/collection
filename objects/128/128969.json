  "text": "Three large-scale forms are arranged in the shape of a split boulder – each form standing between 12 and 20 inches tall. The rounded external backs of each form are covered in fine wires, giving off a cool, matte iron and textured appearance. The inner walls of each form, facing one another, are covered in hammered copper fragments that look reminiscent of tree bark.",
