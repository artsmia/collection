  "text": "Created by Anishinaabe and Inuit fiber artists, this collection showcases the creativity and skill of Native women artists who transform indigenous materials gathered from their homelands into works of art. The technical mastery and ingenuity of these artist appears in the ability to utilize porcupine quills, birchbark, and locally-harvested plant materials to create intricately adorned and finely woven baskets. For more than two centuries, Native women created a market for birchbark containers and baskets to sustain their families during a time of major cultural shifts and external pressures.",
