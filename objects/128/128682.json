  "text": "This is truly a global production. The turban snail, which is native to the Indo-Pacific Ocean, was probably harvested by local fishermen. Craftsmen in Goa or Gujarat polished the shell and decorated it with clusters of rare stones framed by gilt lacquer. It was then exported to Europe as a luxury ware, where a German or Flemish goldsmith embellished it with silver-gilt elements—snails and claws for the shell’s feet, lizards and acanthus leaves contouring the projecting turban, and a rim for the vessel with a Latin inscription. It quotes the Gospel of Matthew with the words Peter spoke to Jesus, “Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee.”",
