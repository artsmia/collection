  "text": "This work by the Sri Lankan photographer Lionel Wendt, who was originally trained in music and law in the United Kingdom in the 1920’s, displays his interest in and experimentation with portraiture, theater, and photography. Untitled (Male Torso with Statue) is a toned and dark gelatin silver print in which a well-lit white marble sculpture of the ancient Greek god Apollo is juxtaposed with a Sri Lankan man’s torso, posed in a similarly theatrical manner. The work speaks to the artist’s interest in classical art and homoeroticism as well as his familiarity with soft-focused pictorial photography and experimental works that draw influences from Surrealism, an art movement in which the subconscious mind and dream analysis have essential roles.",
