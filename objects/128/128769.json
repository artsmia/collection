  "text": "Death is a timeless subject. Made in 1614, this momemto mori (reminder that you must die) is a copy of one made by another German artist, Barthel Beham, about 85 years earlier. The inscription, “Mors Omnia Aequa” (death equalizes all), is reflected in the stack of skulls, whose previous owners have become indistinguishable. The image of the dead infant accompanied by an hourglass also reminds us that our fate may come much sooner than we expect.",
