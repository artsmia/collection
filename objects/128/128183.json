  "text": "Originally trained as an architect, Tolon’s paintings at first appear as purely abstract, but with time, the eye discovers familiar urban landscapes in the rhythmic painted streaks. Her images start to emerge when she begins the process of removal, scraping with a sharp razor blade at thick layers of black oil pigment to unveil scenes that seem extant, as if they have been waiting to be excavated. Though pure geometric abstractions, her paintings evoke landscapes, urban scenes, sprawling constructions, horizons distorted by a kaleidoscope.",
