  "text": "Pátzcuaro, a town located in the Mexican state of Michoacán, was settled more than 200 years before the arrival of the Spanish. When John Taylor Arms visited the town, the area had recently become a tourist mecca under the patronage of native son, Lázaro Cárdenas, Mexico’s president from 1934 to 1940. Even within the tiny confines of this miniature etching, the artist managed to evoke the town’s rich cultural past and beautiful terrain.",
