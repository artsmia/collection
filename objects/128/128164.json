  "text": "Sir William Russell Flint was among the most prominent British Artists of the 1900s. He made his reputation with watercolors that were reproduced as illustrations in books of classic poetry and literature. The red chalk profile view of a squatting woman wearing nothing but sandals is identified as Olivia. This is probably a study for a scene from Virgil's Aeneid. Lavinia was the last wife of Aeneas.",
