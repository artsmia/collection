  "text": "Wadsworth Jarrell created this eye-dazzling portrait of renowned civil rights activist and writer Angela Davis as a testament to her leadership in the fight for racial, gender, and economic justice. Jarrell depicted Davis wearing a “revolutionary” suit that his wife Jae Jarrell designed in 1969 for AfriCOBRA, a Chicago-based artist collective that celebrated black culture. Featuring the group’s signature intense color, Davis’s outfit is covered in her own words as well as Black Power slogans reflecting the ongoing struggle of black people in America. As she speaks, her voice becomes a radiating burst of words and color that mirrors the passion and power of her activism.",
