  "text": "Portrait of a Girl is among Joan Brown’s most startling and engaging self-portraits, a memory picture, allegorical and mysterious. It was painted based on two photographs of Brown as a child. The Chinese dragon screen that looms behind her is based on a black-and-white illustration in a book Brown owned. She took liberties with both her image and the screen, reimagining them and presenting them together to establish a tension between the two elements that provokes the viewer to muse on the relationship between Brown as a little girl and the menacing dragon. Brown was a virtuoso painter who moved fluidly from abstraction in the late 1950s through bold and playful large-scale self portraits in the 1970s and 1980s. She tirelessly brought forth aspects of her persona and personal life in painting both imaginatively and in images drawn from actual events.",
