  "text": "Cloud cover and lake work together in this painting to suggest the misty atmosphere of a Fall day following a passing storm. Alexander Wyant favored these atmospheric scenes and made them in such a way as to allow the viewer to feel what it must have been like to experience this moment in the Adirondack Mountains. Wyant often painted in this location – Lake Placid in New York – and favored autumn for its range of colors and dramatic changes in the landscape. Whiteface Mountain emerges in the distance through the slowly moving clouds.",
