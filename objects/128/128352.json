  "text": "Dudley Huppler was born in Muscoda, Wisconsin, a spot about halfway between Madison and La Crosse. Precocious as an artist and educated in English literature, he used his talents to propel himself into the highest ranks of art-world glitterati. A year after making the present drawing, a reminder of Huppler’s rural beginnings and of his sexuality (he was gay), he left for New York, where he eventually found himself exchanging works with and influencing the American Pop artist Andy Warhol. His use of stippling—lots of dots—gave him a highly individual style among his contemporaries.",
