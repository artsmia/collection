  "text": "Yoshikawa Kanpō, best known as a designer of woodblock prints, was also a lifelong collector of historical artifacts related to Japanese customs. During his lifetime he amassed a collection of some 30,000 objects. Kanpō’s vast knowledge of ancient customs and costume was put to use in the present painting, which depicts an ancient Japanese custom known as kazashi, a Shintō ritual whereby a person’s head or headdress is adorned with flowers and/or leaves. In this picture, a woman at center pins a small bouquet of five cherry blossoms to the hat of the man at left. A younger attendant stands to her right and holds a second small bouquet of the same flowers. All three figures wear costume of the Nara-period (710–794) imperial court.",
