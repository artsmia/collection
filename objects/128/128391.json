  "text": "The woman shown here, Renoir, stands before a mirror, poised, cool, self-assured, and stylish. She was a friend of the artist, Marcia Marcus, and part of an inclusive community of artists, actors, writers, musicians and activists. Renoir’s clothing and hairstyle was daring and modern in 1968, the year she posed for Marcus, but feel current today despite that distance.",
