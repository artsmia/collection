  "text": "Paul Jouve was a famous animal painter and illustrator, celebrated particularly for his depictions of animals from Africa. He was fascinated by the creatures he studied around Paris—in the zoo at the Jardin de Plantes the animal markets, and slaughterhouses. Less well known are the drawings he produced for political publications early in his career, which this drawing may relate to. It represents a “clochard,” the French word for vagabond or tramp, but in France refers more specifically to the homeless often romanticized in literature who lived along the quays of Paris and slept under bridges. Jouve represents this class type without any pretense, seeking, instead, to capture in the subject’s hardened features and solemn expression the difficult existence of some of the less fortunate in the city of lights.",
