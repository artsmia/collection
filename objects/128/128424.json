  "text": "Sultan's landscape paintings, almost all of which he refers to as \"events,\" are about disasters. They warn of the toxic poison floating in the haze of our ignorance of what creates chaos and breakdown in postindustrial civilization.\r\n\r\nThis work specifically references the 1986 Sandoz chemical spill at the Sandoz agrochemical storehouse in Basel-Landschaft, Switzerland. This major environmental disaster was caused by a fire and its subsequent extinguishing released toxic agrochemicals into the air and resulted in tons of pollutants entering the Rhine river, turning it red. The cause of the blaze was never established.",
