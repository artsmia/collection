  "text": "Yang Yongliang is known for creating digitally manipulated photo collages that when viewed from a distance, mirror the tranquility and contemplative nature of traditional landscapes. This print appears to be a traditional scroll in its expansive length that depicts both water and mountainous scenes. Yet when viewed up close, it becomes apparent that the work is composed of disparate contemporary photographs of Shanghai, particularly its skyscrapers and construction sites. Throughout the print, skyscrapers make up scraggy mountain peaks and electrical towers create dense forests. In manipulating traditional landscapes, Yang Yongliang emphasizes the changing relationships between humans and the natural world.",
