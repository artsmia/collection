  "text": "Stokesay Castle is a fortified manor house in Shropshire, in the west of England. Laurence of Ludlow, an extremely rich wool merchant built it in the late 1200s. By the 1800s, the castle had fallen into neglect, but it was saved by an earl, who bankrupted himself in the process. Today, it is a tourist attraction and is considered one of England’s most faithfully preserved medieval building complexes.\r\n\r\nThe etched lines of this image are so fine that one might need a magnifier to distinguish them.",
