  "text": "A contemporary of Vincent van Gogh (1853–1890) and Piet Mondrian (1872–1944), Jan Toorop was one of the leading artists in the Netherlands in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Toorop was born in Java, the son of a Dutch-Indonesian father and English-Chinese mother. He moved to the Netherlands in 1872, at the age of 14, and trained as an artist in Delft, Amsterdam, and Brussels. He was active as a draftsman, painter, printmaker, and designer of posters, book illustration and decorative arts. This is one of a pair of portraits in Mia's collection depicting husband and wife Fritz and Nina Meyer-Fierz. They were executed by Toorop in Zürich in 1909. The Meyer-Fierzes were major art collectors, whose celebrated holdings of modern art included works by van Gogh, Cezanne, Gauguin, Hodler, Mondrian, and Toorop. Karl Friedrich Meyer, aka Fritz (1847–1917), was a wealthy Swiss merchant, whose family owned a tobacco farm in Sumatra, then part of the Dutch Indies. He married Nina Fierz (1860–1925) of England in 1884, and the couple hyphenated their surname. While Toorop depicted Nina as a forceful figure, with an intense, unremitting gaze, he portrays Fritz as a quiet, more contemplative individual, shown in three-quarters view, with a far-off look.",
