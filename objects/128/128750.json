  "text": "At first glance, this print may seem like an abstract rectangle of gray, but closer inspection reveals a careful study of light and form. The dense cluster of blossoms rests in a cylindrical glass vase, partially filled with water. The artist heightens the brightness of the vase by setting it off with a cast shadow, while the flowers seem to illuminate the wall around them.",
