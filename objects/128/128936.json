  "text": "In this lush river landscape, a pair of shepherds tend their flock of sheep as Apollo, the sun god, ushers in a new day on his chariot. He is surrounded by frolicking female\r\nfigures, who represent the Hours, and led by Aurora, the goddess of dawn. She appears\r\nseated below some floating putti, guiding the horses toward the distant horizon.\r\n\r\nThe Bolognese painter Giovanni Francesco Grimaldi arrived in Rome around 1626 and\r\nremained there most of his career. A landscape specialist, he worked in fresco and oil\r\npainting and often incorporated ancient buildings into his idyllic worlds. As the late art\r\nhistorian Norman Canedy observed, the overgrown remnant of a Corinthian temple\r\nfaçade depicted here at right “can be identified as the Temple of Castor and Pollux, the\r\nheroic twins who after miraculously saving Rome appeared to the Romans at a fountain\r\nin the Forum. With the living waters still flowing as yet another new day is breaking, this\r\nruined Roman shrine complex gives venerable voice to historical Time.”",
