  "text": "Sara Cwynar began <i>Three Hands</i> with a series of found photographs that reference a multinational business transaction from the 1970s. Seeking the meaning behind the hand gestures and the cultural as well as financial exchange being documented, she mapped out a dizzying assortment of found images and objects, spanning world history. The result is a flattening of both space and time in an encyclopedic attempt to unpack a moment that is utterly irretrievable.",
