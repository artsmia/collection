  "text": "German artist and photographer Joachim Schulz explores the intersections between past and present, traditional and experimental, and realism and abstraction. In this archival pigment print, part of the series “Blumenstilleben” (Floral Still Lifes), Schulz uses photography and inkjet printing technology to dissolve and rearrange the visual information within an image of a 300-year-old Flemish still life painting. To achieve his surprising effects, Schulz intentionally causes the inkjet printing nozzles to malfunction, flooding the paper with blended pools of colored ink. His choice of non-absorbent paper also prevents the ink from drying quickly, similar to the characteristics of oil painting. Schulz repeats his unconventional process nine times. The procedure conceals the photographic source of his image and connects two painterly techniques, one traditional, one mechanical.",
