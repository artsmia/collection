  "text": "Many artists have made miniature prints, but this one pushes the envelope. On a surface about the size of a high school class ring, John Taylor Arms depicts the Nativity, with Mary adoring the baby Jesus, who lies in the manger. The Latin inscription may be translated as “Glory to God in the highest, and peace on earth to men of good will.\" According to the biblical account of Luke, this was the message of the angels to the shepherds.",
