  "text": "Andrea Bowers’s work focuses on the nexus between art and activism across a broad range of issues, including workers' rights, sexuality, discrimination, and immigration.\r\n\r\nThe figure of the Bugler Girl represented the National Union of Women’s Suffrage Societies, whose struggle for women’s voting rights in the United Kingdom was known as the Suffragette Movement (1897–1918). While the movement was primarily concerned with the voting rights of white women, here Bowers reimagines the Bugler Girl as a woman of color, transforming the call to action to embrace all women.",
