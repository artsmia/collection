  "text": "Maria Laszkiewicz was an innovator in bringing the practices of tapestry and sculpture into dialogue. She and the other weavers who worked in her Warsaw atelier in the 1950s and 1960s also experimented with nontraditional weaving materials, particularly wood and sisal, a fiber derived from rope. In Mask, the woven ground is composed of a traditional Gobelin weave, which situates the work in the French tapestry tradition. But the frequent incorporation of vertical slits, which accentuate the geometric color patterning, is reminiscent of Precolumbian tapestries. This design choice, in combination with the central carved wooden mask which gestures to African art, reveals Laszkiewicz’s interest in non-European textile and sculpture traditions.",
