  "text": "Maria Laszkiewicz was an innovator in bringing the practices of tapestry and sculpture into\r\ndialogue. She and the other weavers who worked in her Warsaw atelier in the 1950s and\r\n1960s also experimented with nontraditional weaving materials, particularly wood and sisal,\r\na fiber derived from rope.\r\nIn Mask, the woven ground is composed of a traditional Gobelin weave, which situates the\r\nwork in the French tapestry tradition. But the frequent incorporation of vertical slits, which\r\naccentuate the geometric color patterning, is reminiscent of Precolumbian tapestries. This\r\ndesign choice, in combination with the central carved wooden mask which gestures to\r\nAfrican art, reveals Laszkiewicz’s interest in non-European textile and sculpture traditions.",
