  "text": "The use of prayer beads spans the globe and is common to various religious traditions, such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Christianity, and Islam. Most prayer beads serve the same basic function: to help worshipers count prayers, chants, or other ritual recitations.\r\n\r\nA Muslim string usually has 99 beads, plus two different beads separating each group of 33, and a single, elongated bead or set of beads at the end, known as the leader. The number 99 (or three times 33) is significant, because the beads help Muslims count when reciting God’s 99 names, a practice that increases a believer’s faith and imparts spiritual benefits. On reaching the final bead, the worshiper says “Allah,” in lieu of the hundredth name that is unknown to humankind.",
