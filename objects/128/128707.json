  "text": "Melvin Edwards is a pioneer in the history of contemporary African American art and sculpture. His work reflects his lifelong engagement with issues of race, labor, violence, and the African diaspora. Working primarily in welded steel and found materials, Edwards is perhaps best known for his Lynch Fragments, an ongoing series of small-scale assemblages born out of the social and political turmoil of the civil rights movement. This example is an homage to Makina Kameya, a stone carver in Zimbabwe. In 1987, Edwards met Kameya during a trip to that country, and he purchased a small sculpture from the older artist. Kameya died before Edwards returned to Zimbabwe the following year, prompting him to create this work in his memory.",
