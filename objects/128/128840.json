  "text": "Dominick Di Meo often moves back and forth between painting, drawing and relief sculpture, and he sometimes mixes all of these methods. This large painting shows his talent for the magical transformation of everyday objects. He made this playful landscape by laying down objects and stencils to form the ground and then sprayed paint around their edges. The result is a combination of shapes embedded in the land that can be identified easily (such as tools and utensils) and some that remain mysterious. Di Meo topped it with three successive phases of the moon that appear like masked faces, watching over the land. Throughout his career Di Meo has returned frequently to nocturnal settings and the suggestion of things buried beneath the earth.",
