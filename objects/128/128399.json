  "text": "If Allen Seaby’s cuckoo has a slight feel of a scientific specimen, that’s because it was modeled after a painting he did for The British Bird Book (1910–13), a survey of bird behavior. He depicted his subject making its “cuckoo” sound, which, as the text explains, is “uttered with the bill closed, or almost so.”",
