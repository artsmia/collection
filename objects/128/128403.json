  "text": "Gruyères Castle was printed from linoleum, a soft material that lends itself to the repetitive curves and fluid lines we see here. Its nonabsorbent surface is well suited to oils, which can be layered to form crisp new colors. In this Swiss scene, the dark part of the mountain is actually green layered over royal blue.\r\n\r\nInvented in 1860s Britain as a floor covering, linoleum consists mostly of linseed oil, cork dust, and rosin. It is easier to cut than wood, and cheaper. Artists began using it in the 1910s after an Austrian professor introduced it to children’s art classes.",
