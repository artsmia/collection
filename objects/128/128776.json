  "text": "This pair of court scenes appears to depict Nur Jahan and Jahagir, rulers of the Moghul Empire, 1611-1627. The elaborate gold decoration in the images suggest the might and wealth of their court. That wife and husband are shown as equals is what sets this royal couple apart from others. Jahagir became emperor in 1605, when the great empire encompassed most of modern day northern India and Pakistan. Unfortunately, he was indecisive, feckless, and addicted to opium. Yet, he found a strong hand in his 20th and final wife, Nur Jahan, a widow brimming with intelligence and charisma. She quickly established her place as favorite consort and took over as the true power behind the throne.",
