  "text": "By combining austere forms with the distinctive fluidity of the ballpoint pen, Il Lee melds Eastern and Western cultural aesthetics into abstractions that are contemporary, yet rooted in tradition. His expressive strokes—characterized by rhythmic, physically demanding arm gestures—leave behind a record of intersecting orbits, undulating lines, and frenetic swirls. When viewed as a whole, these discrete movements are transformed into objects with a monumental presence; mysterious forms that suggest elements of nature, their auras imposing and serene, eliciting awe and inviting meditation.",
