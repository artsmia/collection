  "text": "Roy De Forest loved dogs and he had a disarming sense of humor. He loved nature and being in the landscape, and he loved puns and wordplay. All of this is evident in a raucous, vibrant scene in which geography shifts scale abruptly in several places, moving from a “bird’s-eye view” one moment, to a close up look in another. De Forest developed a personal style that was unlike anyone else’s – kinetically colorful and full of lively details. And always, dogs!",
