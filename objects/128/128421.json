  "text": "Kim Jones began making war drawings when still a child. These richly detailed, map-like drawings remain one of the mainstays of his creative practice. In this extraordinary example, Jones produces a hybrid artwork—part found object, part drawing. Using a vintage U.S. naval jacket as a starting point, he incorporates various wooden sticks and layers of plaster that serve as a surface for his imaginary battle drawings. A veteran of the Vietnam War (1955–75), Jones emphasizes the game-like structure of warfare, but one in which winners and losers are often difficult to determine.",
