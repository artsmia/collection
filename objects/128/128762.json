  "text": "Gerald Purdy specializes in witty, sometimes bizarre images. This miniature forces us to come close and pay attention, only to find that we are witnessing something extraordinary and appalling: a man is falling from the cornice of a building. On closer inspection, we see that the door is open to the small penthouse enclosing the stairs to the roof. The casual nature of the artist’s treatment of the drama adds to the twist of its dark humor.",
