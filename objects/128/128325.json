  "text": "Francisco Dosamantes was a leading Mexican graphic artist, educator, and founding member of the Taller de Gráfica Popular (TGP), a historically important print collective that produced pamphlets, illustrations, and editioned prints in support of progressive social and political ideals. Dosamantes designed this now-iconic poster to announce the TGP’s first exhibition, which took place in 1939 at the National University of Mexico and featured twenty lithographs. The poster’s dramatic, surrealist-influenced “all-seeing eye” design is exceptional among TGP publications and stands as an important example of modernist Latin American graphic design.",
