  "text": "In Overlay, Hopi artist Les Namingha exhibits his mastery in ceramics and in painting.\r\nNamingha, great-grandson of Nampeyo (1859/60–1942), the renowned Hopi potter, credits his innovate approach to his aunt, Dextra Quotskuyva, who always encouraged him to make pottery in traditional form but with new designs. Namingha was inspired by a work of similar shape made by Nampeyo more than 100 years earlier. Like that pot, his symmetrical vessel has a pristinely smooth surface painted with finely detailed patterns in brilliant colors.",
