  "text": "David Johnson aspired to present views of nature he had witnessed with great clarity and a quality of light that makes them appear to glow. He worked through the styles and approaches of other artists who gave him lessons in his youth before finding his own voice. It is evident here in the sense of calm and sensitivity to atmosphere that brought him admiration from the public and critics.",
