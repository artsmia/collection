  "text": "The work Christian, 2013, from the artist’s latest series portrays day laborers hired off the street, a visible but often politically underrepresented group. The work retains the figurative distortions of Sonsini’s earlier career, but offers a more empathetic approach to portraiture. The subjects are often taken out of their usual environments and placed on abstract backgrounds alongside props that relate to their cultural identity and migratory existence.",
