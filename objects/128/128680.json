  "text": "The French painter and draftsman Lucien Ott is best known for his landscapes and cityscapes. From 1901 until the outbreak of World War I, he exhibited his work regularly at the Salon des Indépendents. He particularly favored views along the Seine, with an interest in capturing in the realist tradition the daily rhythms of life on the river and quays. Here he depicts a group of barges and houseboats at the foot of a suspension bridge. It might be the small town of Triel-sur-Seine, 40 kilometers northwest of Paris, which opened public hot baths (“Bains Chauds”) in 1908 on a river barge, a rare thing in the countryside in this period.",
