  "text": "Gilles Peress' s photographs of Bosnia expose  the psychological impact of the Bosnian War. Images depicting the traumas and rigors of life endured by soldiers, refugees and civilians on a daily basis. Peress confronts European history and the reemergence of nationalism, asking people to consider their role in these cycles of history.\r\n\r\n\"These photographs show a nation invaded, a nation at war. Refugees are on the road, drifting through the rain, moving through camps and hospitals, an endless calvary of images flashing by in a blur: exhaustion, too many images, too much horror. The witnesses become indifferent. My point is that we, in the comfort of our lives, must question our role in the history of Bosnia, which is also our history.\"\r\n\r\n- Gilles Peress",
