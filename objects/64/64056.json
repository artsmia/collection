  "text": "Located in southwest Kyñshñ, the southern most of the Japan's four main islands, Bønoura Beach faces the East China Sea. Towering rock formations, named double sword stones, are a popular destination among visitors to the area. In the foreground, Hiroshige depicts a small boat approaching the rocks with two tourists on board. Seated beneath a parasol, they gazed admiringly up at the fantastic sight. Although Hiroshige exaggerated the rocks a bit, he well represented the scenic beauty of the area.",
