  "text": "Sea Chamber is a monumental turned sculpture that comments on what Mississippi calls \"the enigmatic qualities of Time.\"  She sees the plywood of which this piece is made as a representation of history, with each layer representing generations and events of the past.  When she created Sea Chamber, whose form is inspired by seashells, Mississippi was thinking about the ecologial connections between humans and the depths of the oceans.  Mississippi often creates works, both turned and carved, from plywood.  For her, it represents \"an association between the melding of machine and Nature, in that plywood has been manipulated technologically, and yet it still shows its natural wood characteristics.\"",
