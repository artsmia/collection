  "text": "Located on the east coast of the Bøsø Peninsula in Kazusa Province, or today's Chiba Prefecture, Yasashi-ga-ura Beach is better known as Kujñkurihama, \"Ninety-nine League Long Beach.\" As the nickname suggests, the beach is very long and even now a popular swimming and surfing destination for residents of Tokyo. In Hiroshige's time, it was famous for sardines, long an important part of the Japanese diet. Hiroshige depicted the locals drawing a long-haul seine, the traditional method of sardine fishing in the area. By using a bird-eye view, Hiroshige ably depicts the long stretch of gently curving sandy beach.",
