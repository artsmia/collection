  "text": "Located at the tip of the Noto Peninsula that extends northward into the Japan Sea from the coast of Ishikawa Prefecture in the central Japan, Takinoura Beach has long been known for its wondrous view of a series of overhanging cliffs and high rocks. The caves were formed by powerful ocean waves. Hiroshige's depiction shows the rocky and dark interiors of the caves, while the upper surface of the peninsula is bathed in sunshine and covered in lush vegetation. Cherry trees are in full bloom suggesting that spring has finally come to the northern province.",
