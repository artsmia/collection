  "text": "This image of the 17th century dinner party suggests that group napkins were once quite common.  From Mongolia to Turkey, groups of honored guests were provided on special occasions with a single elaborate napkin.  In urban areas the form seems to have disappeared by the end of the 18th century and this piece is a rare example.",
