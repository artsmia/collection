  "text": "In contrast with the Hiroshige's quiet landscapes, his pupil, Hiroshige II created this dynamic rendering of \"homing geese\" in his series Eight Views of the Sumida River. \"Shirahige\" in the title refers to the shrine, which is hidden within a grove of trees.  Hiroshige II may have chosen this location because there was a wide-open floodplain between the shrine and the river. With no buildings to obscure the spectacular view, people could enjoy seeing the grassy floodplain, the Sumida River, and even the opposite bank. In fact, the small roofed buildings built on the edge of the elevated ground are observation platforms where people could relax while taking in the scenery. Hiroshige II enlivens the scene by picturing a flock of geese as they make their descent into the fields. ",
