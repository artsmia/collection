  "text": "French mills have manufactured machine-woven imitations of handwoven tapestries on jacquard looms for more than a hundred years. The weight and durability of jacquard weaves make the cloth ideal for upholstery. But by the mid-20th century, these fabrics had lost their appeal and were no longer considered suitable for production by America’s leading contemporary textile design company. \r\nOne French textile family, the Leclercqs, were therefore surprised when Jack Larsen selected a traditional floral sample from the Leclercq’s production mill for the Larsen line. Summergarden was so successful that the company developed further color variations of the pattern over the next twenty years.",
