  "text": "Spice Garden, the company’s first printed fabric, appealed to the contemporary aesthetic of the 1950s. The unusual use of color combined with a pattern of randomly scattered flowers, which were then unified by a subtle printed texture overlay. A popular pattern for twenty years, Spice Garden was printed on a number of different types of ground fabric, including lightweight linen, cotton, cotton and silk, and velvet.",
