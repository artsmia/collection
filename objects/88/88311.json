  "text": "Many designers have worked with the company throughout its history. Only one, Lori Weitzner, collaborated with the studio on three consecutive collections. Solace, introduced as part of the Simply Grand collection, was created as an upholstery fabric. The pattern was popular during the 1990s and used in a number of unexpected ways, from wall covering for a ballroom in Asia (requiring 300 yards) to fashion wear. This sample is the largest in the collection; five-inch swatches represent the other colorways.",
