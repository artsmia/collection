  "text": "Sometimes the possibilities of a particular technique inspired design ideas.  The subtle spontaneity that batik wax-resist processes offered had intrigued the Larsen team but posed a challenge to consistent production. In the mid-1960s, the company purchased equipment originally used to create sarongs that Dorothy Lamour wore in her movie roles. Win Anderson modified the machine so it accepted yard-long design repeats and accommodated 54-inch-wide velvet.  \r\n\r\nThe resist-dye process involves printing cloth with a wax pattern that acts as a block to color absorption when the fabric is put into a dye bath. Total dye saturation enables designers to achieve nuances not possible with printed patterns. 50-yard bolts were produced in this way, but the process was extremely laborious and only a few designs using this technique were introduced into the company's offerings.",
