  "text": "Jack is famous in the textile world for his ability to see the aesthetic potential of textile technology.  In the 1970s Jack traveled to England where he noticed some chairs with a rather undistinguished faux needlepoint upholstery.  Noting the unusual, almost tapestry-like surface, he realized that it had the potential to capture the essence of some types of Middle Eastern and Central Asian flat woven textiles.  <I>Turkoman</I> was introduced as part of the Premises-Kelim collection.  Presented in a number of different color ways, from traditional deep reds and blues of kilims, to the fashionable pale hues of dhurries the textile received considerable attention and became a particularly distinctive fabric in the Larsen collection.",
