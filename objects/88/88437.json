  "text": "French mills have manufactured machine-woven imitations of handwoven tapestries on jacquard looms for more than a hundred years. The weight and durability of jacquard weaves make the cloth ideal for upholstery. But by the mid-20th century, these fabrics had lost their appeal and were no longer considered suitable for production by America’s leading contemporary textile design company. <P>\r\nOne French textile family, the Leclercqs, were therefore surprised when Jack Larsen selected a traditional floral sample from the Leclercq’s production mill for the Larsen line. <I>Summergarden</I> was so successful that the company developed further color variations of the pattern over the next twenty years.",
