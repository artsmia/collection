  "text": "The tulip has been a favorite flower of gardeners and textile designers for centuries. In the 17th century the Dutch mania for this Turkish hill flower made it a very desirable bloom in European gardens. Jack Larsen often uses masses of a single type of flower to create a particular effect and this year he planted 20,000 bulbs at LongHouse.\r\nGardens take time to mature and this is often true of textile designs. As can be seen on the border of this panel of Tuplimania, the fabric was screenprinted in 1972. The design wasn't actually copyrighted until 1978, however, and wasn't available in the company's showrooms until 1981.",
