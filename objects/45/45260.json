  "text": "Early in his career Pierre Bonnard made Woman with an Umbrella for the literary and art journal La Revue blanche.  The model was Marthe de Méligny, a timid florist's assistant whom the artist met late in 1893 and who soon became his muse. Contemporaries described her as having \"a skipping step on heels as high and thin as a bird's feet.\"  Here Bonnard successfully captures Marthe's delicate figure and distinctive posture while effectively presenting a modern Parisian woman.",
