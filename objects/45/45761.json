  "text": "A prodigious and innovative printmaker, Degas was a keen observer of daily life in Paris, especially the working world of milliners and laundresses. In this mixed intaglio print, he presents a sympathetic portrayal of two women ironing clothes in what appears to be a basement laundry, while a third woman rests with head in hand. Echoing his own social concerns for the often miserable lives of the working poor, Degas repeatedly explored the subject of laundresses and other workers in his paintings, drawings, and prints.",
