  "text": "Protective deities are represented in visually and symbolically complex artworks, such as this scroll painting. Within a fantastic landscape of deities and spirits, Pehar valiantly gallops, holding a vajra (lightning bolt representing enlightenment) and a skull cup (representing the conquest of ignorance) in his quest to protect the Buddhist faith. The black background symbolizes hate, which, through wisdom and compassion, is transformed into luminous deities of enlightened bliss.",
