  "text": "For this writing box, the renowned lacquer artist Yōyūsai was inspired by a poem that occurs in the 9th century Tales of Ise, attributed to the courtier Ariwara Narihira (depicted on the cover of the box).  When the protagonist of the story (possibly Narihira himself) comes upon a marsh of blossoming irises, he composes a poem beginning each line with a syllable from the Japanese word for iris (<I>kakitsubata</I>):\r\n<P><I>Karogoromo\t\tI have a beloved wife\r\n<P>Kitsutsu narenishi\t\tFamiliar as the skirt\r\n<P>Tsuma shi areba\t\tOf a well-worn robe\r\n<P>Harubaru kinuru\t\tAnd so, this distant journeying\r\n<P>Tabi o shi zo omou.\t\tFills my heart with grief.</I>",
