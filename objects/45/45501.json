  "text": "Armand Séguin was a Post-Impressionist French painter best remembered for his involvement in the Pont-Aven School beginning in 1891. In 1892, he worked there with Pierre-Auguste Renoir. The following year, he studied with Paul Gauguin. His Parisian themes in the 1880s were very much influenced by the posters and caricatures of Toulouse-Lautrec, while his 1890s paintings of life in Brittany, on the Atlantic coast, are closer to the art of Emile Bernard and Gauguin, whose influence is most evident in the execution and color scheme of this painting. Séguin suffered an early death from tuberculosis, and his paintings are rare in American collections.",
