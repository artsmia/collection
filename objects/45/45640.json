  "text": "This magnificent bronze helmet is an exceptional example of Corinthian personal armor. It is skillfully beaten from a single sheet of bronze. Developed in the early 600's BCE, the \"Corinthian style\" helmet had no ear holes, but had a cap-shaped crown, solid nose guard, and flared cheek pieces. For display and further protection, a horsehair crest would have been attached to the top of the crown ridge. Small holes pierced along this ridge would have been used to secure the missing crest. Away from combat, the helmet could be pushed up to rest above the face. A typical set of Greek armor from this period also included a bronze breastplate and metal shin guards called greaves. The pure abstract form, simple curvilinear eyebrows, and restrained floral d√©cor make this an especially beautiful, utilitarian object.",
