  "text": "Anhui and Shexian, in particular, had been the center of the ink-making industry since Tang times (618-906). The son of a prosperous Anhui merchant, Cheng Dayue immersed himself in the design and production of ink cakes from an early age. This lacquer presentation box to hold an ink container is a very rare example signed by the artist. Decorated on the exterior with a boating scene, this circular box would have originally held a round commemorative ink cake. Inside the cover and on the base are three gold lacquer seals of the workshop of Cheng Junfang, a well-known art name of Cheng Dayue. They read, \"Made under the supervision of Junfang from Yanzhen in old She (Huizhou).\"",
