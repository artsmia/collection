  "text": "This painting relates to Buddhist ideas of reclusion in nature. In the foreground is a river, and along the path that moves upward into the mountains is a Buddhist monastery situated in the valley. The poem inscribed at the top reads:\r\n\r\n<i>Monk’s mat, fragrant lamp, and tea\r\nI came to visit a temple with great joy\r\nAlthough we are in the earthly realm, there is no noise\r\nThe shifting scenery shows the passage of time\r\nThe fragrant southern winds quickly reach the northern snow\r\nThe spring suddenly approaches the winter plum blossoms\r\nI return home late while composing a poem about the glow of the sunset\r\nThe smoke that shrouds the old tree grove disperses the crows</i>",
