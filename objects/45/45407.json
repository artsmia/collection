  "text": "Born near Yangzhou into an artisan family, Cai Jia's early training was as a silversmith, but he was friendly with several leading artistic and cultured figures and he gradually evolved into a skilled painter, poet, and calligrapher. He saw himself as part of the Qing orthodox lineage and was strongly influenced by Wang Hui (1632-1717), Wang Shimin (1592-1680), and others of this important group.\r\nCai often painted with color in a controlled manner and precise brushwork that generally reflected the conservative orthodox tradition. He was also, however, a lyrical poetic painter of romantic images as this large, ink landscape demonstrates. When Cai breaks from the orthodox formulas of ink drawing followed by color application as he does \r\nWhile the painting is an original concept of the artist, his inscription is found on an earlier painting by the famous Wu school artist, Wen Zhengming (1470-1559). The odd alignment of the inscription is seen in one of the few other landscapes by Cai Jia done in this style.",
