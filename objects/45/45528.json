  "text": "This detailed ink cake is decorated on one side with a landscape painting in low relief and a poem after the writer Wen Zhengming (1470–1559). The opposite side is carved with cavorting dragons and a poetic inscription by the Qianlong emperor (r. 1736–95) on the reverse.\r\n\r\nThe poem by Wen reads:\r\n\r\nAn elegant pavilion at the turn of the stream;\r\n\r\nThe pine tops crane out of the woods.\r\n\r\nFallen leaves drift away on the water, Autumn’s colors stay, completely covering the fragrant mountain.",
