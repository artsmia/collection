  "text": "Born in Detroit Lakes, Minnesota, Frank Big Bear is an acclaimed Ojibwe painter, draftsman, and printmaker, who explores the diverse social, political, and cultural realities of Native American life, past and present. Though Big Bear’s work is nearly always representational, it is typically characterized by mosaic-like patterns of layered and interwoven forms and colors that produce a distinctive abstracted reality. Many of his compositions have a fragmented quality, blending perspective and perceived realities.",
