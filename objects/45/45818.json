  "text": "This water container has the distinguishing features including flanged neck and upturned, pointed spout of a kendi, a uniquely shaped water vessel that was popular throughout many southeast Asian countries over several centuries. This relatively large, finely-potted example stands near the beginning of the tradition. Datable by thermaluminescence analysis to the sixth or seventh century, it represents the unglazed ceramics produced in Cambodia just prior to the founding of the Khmer empire (802-1437). Although Khmer potters developed somewhat harder, more durable ceramics featuring dark brown and light yellow-green glazes, these vessel forms were influenced by the robust shapes seen in pre-Khmer earthenware pottery like this kendi.",
