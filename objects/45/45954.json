  "text": "Important men in ancient Costa Rica wore celts as pendants. The incised decoration imbued with cinnabar makes this one exceptional.  It delineates important details of this warrior's clothing and characteristics, particularly his long, forked tongue.  The extended tongue, which reaches all the way down his chest before separating into two rounded ends, is meant to evoke serpents.  Serpents are beings with strong supernatural powers, and the warrior's connection to them increased his own might and abilities.",
