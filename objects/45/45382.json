  "text": "The Song of Songs (also called the Song of Solomon) is recited on Passover, the spring festival commemorating the escape of the people of Israel from their bondage in Egypt. The Song of Songs is a fervid love poem in the form of a dialog exchanged between a young bride and bridegroom and is often interpreted as symbolizing God's love for the people of Israel.  The lovers delight in describing the physical charms of one another in vivid imagery, such as the passage that reads, My beloved is like a gazelle or a young stag.  Look, there he stands behind our wall, gazing in at the windows…  This illustrated megillah (scroll) is written in Hebrew and therefore read from right to left.",
