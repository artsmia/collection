  "text": "Made from pale bamboo, this wristrest is engraved with a tz'u poem about travels on the Yangtze in the energetic style that made Cheng Hsieh's \"grass script\" famous. Cheng was an outstanding artist. He was a painter and calligrapher as well as one of the great seal-carvers of Ch'ing. He gained his chin-shih degree in 1736, served as a district magistrate in Shantung until 1753 and is well-known as one of the Eight Eccentrics of Yangchou.\r\n\r\nAs a painter Cheng specialized in orchids, bamboo, and rocks in ink. Cheng's art name, Feng-tzu means \"madman\" and as a calligrapher he invented his own style which is generally called, li-ts'ao or \"running official style.\" It is this exuberant form of script that is shown in this brushrest made around a hundred years after Cheng wrote his poem.",
