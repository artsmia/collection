  "text": "Towards the end of the 12th century, molded decoration was introduced in Qingbai ware and, by the Yuan dynasty (1280–1368), exceptionally fine, molded vessels were being produced. Some of the ewers echoed the forms of Persian and Tibetan metalwork, such as this extremely rare example, of which only a few are recorded.\r\n\r\nThe slender, pear-shaped body displays a pair of phoenixes in molded relief above a wide band of lotus petal lappets around the base. The curving tubular spout rises out of the open jaws of a bearded dragonhead opposite an elaborately molded handle in the form of a dragon. In its complexity, the vessel displays several of the innovative Qingbai techniques developed during the Yuan dynasty including the use of beaded relief in the neck, applied slip, elaborate molding, and finely tooled detailing.",
