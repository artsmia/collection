  "text": "Manning-Bowman introduced a waffle iron in 1937 that could bake two waffles in the space and time of one, all in a streamlined case. Batter is poured onto the top griddle and then the unit is rotated allowing batter to flow to the second griddle. The 1937 catalogue noted The Twin Reversible overcomes once and for all the inconvenience of trying to satisfy hungry appetites with inadequate servings. By 1941, the unit was given a new name, the Twin-O-Matic.",
