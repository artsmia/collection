  "text": "This print was Itō Shinsui’s first collaboration with the publisher Watanabe Shōzaburō (1885–1962). Intended for the foreign market, it originally had an English title, <I>The Scarlet Lady</I>, although this hardly does justice to the artist’s skillful suggestion of the woman’s introspection by focusing her gaze on a mirror outside the frame.\r\n\r\nMany years later, Shinsui’s contemporary, the scholar Fujikake Shizuya (1881–1958), lauded this print for its “outstanding composition, ” “superior color distribution, ” “beauty of color tone, ” “lines that convey volume, ” and the artist’s “care not to bring the painting line into prints.” Notable, too, are deliberate rubbing lines in the background, executed with the corner of a rubbing pad (baren) to create textural tension against the large flat blocks of red and black.",
