  "text": "This large bamboo wristrest has been carved through the pale skin creating a design of bamboo modeled after a painting by Hsieh Chih-lu (born 1910), one of Shanghai's most famous modern painters. The carving technique used here called <I>liu-ch'ing</I>, is the most difficult method of carving bamboo. When properly executed, the outer skin of the stalk is cut away leaving the design in pale reserve against the darker ground.\r\n<BR>\r\n<P>Fang Chin-hsia is an outstanding female <I>liu-ch'ing</I> bamboo carver. Her inscription states, For the enjoyment of Dr. Ip Yee carved for presentation by Fang Chin-hsia. Dr. Ip Yee is an important Hong Kong collector of scholar's objects.",
