  "text": "White stoneware with a glazed surface made its appearance in the northern dynasties (420-589). The production of high-fired white stoneware was a major achievement; it broke away from the stereotypical celadon preceding it, helped create the taste for fine porcelain, and set the stage for overglaze painted stoneware. In the Sui Tang period (6th-7th centuries), white stoneware achieved renown in north China where it was originally produced.\r\nThe earliest kilns to perfect white porcelaneous stoneware were the Xing kilns in Hebei province. By mid-to-late Tang (8th-9th century), their wares were considered the best of their time with extremely durable, high-fired (1320Â° c), pure white bodies of simple form, no slip, and perfectly clear lustrous glazes. Other kilns were quick to imitate them, but the different local clays made exact imitation impossible.",
