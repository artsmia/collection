  "text": "Zha Sheng (1650–1707), from Haining in Zhejiang province, was a leading scholar, palace official, painter, and calligrapher. Upon gaining his doctorate (<i>jinshi</i>) in 1688, he was made vice supervisor of the household of the heir apparent. His inscription on the reverse side of this inkstone reads:\r\n\r\nThe cloud’s root is like new skin, Growing day and night in the endless rain.\r\n\r\nWhat is this slice of stone?\r\n\r\nIt is a congealed spot of ancient clouds.\r\n\r\nIf it is touched by fragrant lampblack (ink)\r\n\r\nEssence of dew will sprinkle onto the brush tip.\r\n\r\nUsing this brush to write the sage’s classics, All will be enriched the whole world wide.",
