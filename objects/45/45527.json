  "text": "Cha Sheng, from Hai-ming Chekiang province, was a leading scholar, Han Lin academician, palace official, painter, and calligrapher. Upon gaining his doctorate (chin-shih) in 1688 he was made Vice Supervisor of the household of the heir apparent. Carved with a pleasingly simple design of swirling clouds, the reverse side reads: \r\nThe clouds' root is like new skin,\r\nGrowing day and night on the endless rain.\r\nWhat is this slice of stone'\r\nIt is a congealed spot of ancient clouds.>\r\nIf it is touched by fragrant lamp-black (ink)\r\nEssence of dew will sprinkle onto the brush tip.\r\nUsing this brush to write the sage's classics, \r\nAll will be enriched the whole world wide.\r\n\r\nInscribed by Cha Sheng of western Chekiang in early summer of 1686.",
