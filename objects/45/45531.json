  "text": "This wristrest is inscribed on its top side with an extensive poetic commentary in regular running script (<I>hsing-shu</I>) by the well-known Kuang-tung calligrapher, Ch'en Feng. Graduated in 1832, Ch'en was a noteworthy teacher and researcher in several areas of study and was highly regarded as a calligrapher in all scripts. Engraved in the skin on the wristrest's reverse side (shown here) is a stylish inscription in clerical script (<I>Li-shu</I>) which records its ownership by the Early Studies Studio, and dating to the fourteenth year of the Tao-Kuang period (1835).",
