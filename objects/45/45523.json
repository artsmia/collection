  "text": "Wang Wu was a member of an important Ming dynasty literati family and was also a noted connoisseur and poet. This painting of plum, narcissus, and rock makes use of standard literati subject matter-the plants and rock symbolizing the harmony of nature and the tenacious character of the scholar-official.\r\n\r\nMounted on either side of the painting are seven poetic colophons dated July 10 and 11, 1775, evidently written as a poem competition upon viewing the painting. The authors were all scholar-official members of the court. In fact, three inscriptions are by sons of the Qianlong Emperor, Prince Yongxuan (1746-1832), Prince Yongxing (1752-1863), and Prince Yongji (1752-76).\r\n\r\nWang Wu's poem reads:\r\n<I>When can I be free from these ties to worldly affairs'\r\nThe bright window responds with a long time of silence.\r\nOutside, the homeward birds catch the glow of sunset, \r\nFeeling chilly, flowers hide behind the rock. \r\nMan's drifting life is just like a dream, \r\nSo don't try to recollect past glories. \t\r\nHowever, I am still interested in going on an excursion, \r\nAnd I will prepare my shoes while waiting for the return of spring. \r\n\r\nWang Wu painted this scroll playfully in the 12th moon of the year of wuwu (1678).</I>\r\n",
