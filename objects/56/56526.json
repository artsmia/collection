  "text": "The inclusive spirit of L'Estampe originale means that it commemorates the era's most provocative artists, but also its forgotten. Carlos Schwabe, a newcomer to the Paris art scene in 1890, saw art as a path to spirituality at a time when industry celebrated the material world. Using fastidious linework and visionary motifs, he sought to reveal a transcendent Ideal. Until recently, this print was incorrectly thought to depict the Annunciation.",
