  "text": "Agnes Martin rose to prominence in the 1960s and 1970s with geometric abstractions that explored the expressive and meditative possibilities of squares, grids, and lines. Though her work is often associated with Minimalism, Martin felt more closely aligned with the Abstract Expressionists, whose emphasis on the spiritual and existential aspects of art was more in keeping with her own philosophy. Her preference for painting entirely by hand using subdued colors and ritualized processes was central to her practice and revealed the highly subjective and idiosyncratic nature of her work.",
