  "text": "The creative freedom spurred by André Marty's publication produced tonal effects far ahead of their time. Charles-Marie Dulac gave this lone outcropping a pervasive spirituality through his impressionistic use of color. In 1892, after years as a wallpaper colorist, Dulac became a Roman Catholic and devoted himself to creating meditative landscapes like this. Before Dulac's death at age 33 from lead poisoning, the novelist Joris-Karl Huysmans had planned to open an art colony with him in a Benedictine monastery.",
