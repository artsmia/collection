  "text": "This exquisite black container has faded with age to a muted brownish-black. The finely inlaid design illustrates Liu Hai, one of the Taoist Immortals, playing with his three-legged toad beneath a pine tree. A line of twisted or plaited silver wire forms a border around the top and is repeated above and below the diaper pattern on the sides. This wire technique is found as early as the fourteenth century. The shell inlay, commonly referred to as mother-of-pearl, is particularly well-crafted for such a small composition.",
