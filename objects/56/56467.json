  "text": "The name Félicien Rops evokes his notoriously erotic prints and his fascination with the seamy Parisian demimonde. Another powerful draw was the Flemish countryside, where he regularly retreated to do landscapes. Rops seemed to demarcate these two worlds in his work, never giving his rural women the come-hither aura of his city women. As he showed in this etching, the countryside was the province of humility and hard work.",
