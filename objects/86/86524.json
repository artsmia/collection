  "text": "The name of a particular design often creates links to related ideas. Aubusson was chosen for this pattern because of its obvious connection to the French tapestry-weaving town that is famous for the many Verdure wall hangings that they created during the 17th century. The large, exotic leaf pattern elements of this style were intended to bring the joy of nature into one's home environment.",
