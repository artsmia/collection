  "text": "The Larsen Design team has always been noted for their mastery of the most \r\nsophisticated technology of the textile industry, yet never succumbing to simply \r\ncreating a tour de force of technical excellence. Most print mills producing quality \r\ntextiles worked with a range of eight to twelve colors.  This textile with its subtle \r\nmodulation of the background and the painterly quality of the abstracted flowers takes full advantage of the available twenty colors, but doesn't allow the technology to dominate.\r\n\r\nGedeohn did not originally draw this pattern unit, which he repeated three times across the width of the fabric, and then dropped the center element a half step.  However, his skill as a painter and colorist has transformed it into a textile that is quite soothing from a distance and amazingly intriguing at closer view.",
