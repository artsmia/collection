  "text": "Textile designers are inspired by numerous sources, from abstract concepts and the beauty of nature to objects from the material world. The designer also uses a wide range of techniques to make inspiration a reality. Paul Gedeohn has remarked that the creation of dynamic, repeating designs through pattern manipulation is one of the challenges of textile production that he particularly enjoys. In this instance he painted a flower and leaf watercolor that could be repeated three times across the width of the fabric. He then took the central unit, reversed it, and at the same time lowered it so it was no longer in alignment with the pattern units on the outer edges.",
