  "text": "Textile designers are inspired by numerous sources, from abstract concepts \r\nand the beauty of nature to objects from the material world.  The designer also uses a wide range of techniques to make inspiration a reality.   \r\n\r\nPaul Gedeohn has remarked that the creation of dynamic, repeating designs through pattern manipulation is one of the challenges of textile production that he\r\nparticularly enjoys.  In this instance he painted a flower and leaf watercolor\r\nthat could be repeated three times across the width of the fabric.  He then took\r\nthe central unit, reversed it, and at the same time lowered it so it was no\r\nlonger in alignment with the pattern units on the outer edges.",
