  "text": "This pattern, inspired by the lush Art Nouveau innovations introduced at the end of the 19th century, was originally part of a fashion fabric line created by Ja-eL, a subsidiary of Jack Lenor Larsen.  Although the apparel fabrics were only produced for three years, certain designs were adapted to new ground fabrics and incorporated into the company's interiors textile production.  \r\n\r\nInitially introduced as a nylon knit under the name of Firebird, in 1966 it was marketed as a fashion fabric and later as upholstery for contour furniture.  In 1973 it was printed on a cotton velvet ground fabric and proved popular for draperies as well as upholstery.",
