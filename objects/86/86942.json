  "text": "<I>Landis</I>, named after the artist whose unique handwoven textiles inspired the design, was a popular upholstery fabric that soon became a signature cloth for the company.<P>  \r\nIn developing the design, the studio worked extensively with a Swiss mill to refine the pattern. After a few years of production, the mill altered equipment and could no longer weave this type of cloth. Larsen had faced similar difficulties before and often found a new supply source. The solution for continued production of <I>Landis</I> proved more challenging. Mark Pollack, project manager for this endeavor, worked with a mill in New Zealand and developed a totally new cloth, <I>Landis II</I>, which captured the essence of the earlier Larsen textile and the art that inspired it.",
