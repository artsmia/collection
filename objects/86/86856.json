  "text": "History frequently plays a part in design sensibility. In America, the influence of English gardens and Indian textiles has had a major impact on their respective areas. <I>Jardiniére</I> is reminiscent of shawl fabrics produced in Northern India at the beginning of the 19th century, but the use of a satin striped, print groundcloth references concerns relating to issues of light and shadow that are so important to all areas of design.",
