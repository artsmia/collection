  "text": "For nine years the company offered this Shirley St. John design as a custom print. The concept of the single large image on individual panels did not excite American clients and so was never stocked in the United States. In the 1970s, the company developed several patterns for Europeans, who where more inclined to include a variety of patterns in their interior arrangements.",
