  "text": "Incorporating the unexpected into a fabric was an important aspect of the design decision for the Larsen team.  In the late 1980s the studio, working with a Swiss mill, began to explore the possibilities of a sheer double cloth.  This weave structure was one of Jack’s favorites (as it was for William Morris!), but it was most often used to explore and exploit color potential.  \r\nIn this particular instance the interest comes from an optical effect created when two plain weave, voile fabrics are joined in a way that allows some independent movement of the individual panels.  Using a double weave structure, patterns were developed that controlled the size and shape of  “pocketed” areas where a spontaneous moiré texture might develop.  As the fabric moves, the moiré pattern changes.  Between 1986 and 1991 four different Hologram textiles were introduced into the Larsen collection.",
