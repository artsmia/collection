  "text": "Gossamer, a very popular, pleated casement fabric with irregular repeats, was made possible by the printing and heat-setting innovations developed by Japanese mills. Sheer and solid fabrics, Pierotte and Carefree, which related to the opaque and transparent areas of the design were also developed by the studio, but they were never as popular as Gossamer. \r\nIn the last decade of the 20th century, polyester was refined in ways that enhanced its resistance to the destructive effects of sunlight. This improvement gave it a distinct advantage over silk, which degrades rapidly under such conditions, and it was often used by the design team.",
