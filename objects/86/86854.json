  "text": "Weitzner's desire to develop a design concept that took advantage of the unique texture and surface characteristics of velvet, led to the development of this distinctive texture. The challenge of maintaining stability and loft of the pleating system needed for upholstery fabric was solved by mechanical means: first pleating and then adhering the system to a backing cloth of suitably density and flexibility.   \r\n\r\nJacob's Ladder, available in eight color ways, was a very successful fabric for Larsen and the company continued to produce it for many years.",
