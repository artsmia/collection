  "text": "High Range seems to have been a late addition to the Great Color of China collection, appearing on the last page of the 1972 price list under the heading \"Addition of fabrics and colors.\" Its two colorways, Jadite and Copper, pick up the lighter tones of the Dunhuang palette, yet coordinate well with the other fabrics in the collection.\r\n\r\nAnil de Silva, author of the book that inspired Larsen to create this collection, describes the murals in the Caves of the Thousand Buddhas as landscape paintings. He suggest that the natural features encountered in the caves are,\r\n\"the landscape of the Chinese countryside, the strange rocks, the waterfalls, the endless miles of fantastic mountains and plateaux, the trees, the lotus ponds, the wild mountain gorges.\" The publicity for High Range refers to its imagery as \"mountains as old as time punctuate the open skies and banded seas of an unpeopled world.\".",
