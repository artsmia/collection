  "text": "A garden is not always flowers and often vines can be used very effectively to create variations and transitions in garden design.\r\nAlthough flowers have been a popular figural element within the textile design world they were often thought trivial by those favoring a modernist aesthetic. Here the design emphasizes a relationship to nature and growing things and thus makes the connection to the ever-popular theme.",
