  "text": "These two objects are high-quality eighteenth-century examples of tea wares. The teapot by Pelletreau who apprenticed with Simeon Soumain (whose porringer is shown here) has an inverted pear shape, which would have been hand-hammered upside down to form its signature shape. The similarly-shaped body of the Richardson creamer, with its integral spout, was likely also raised from one piece of silver. The single cast foot distinguishes this Philadelphia creamer from tri-footed New England examples.",
