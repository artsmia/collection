  "text": "This tankard was made by John Coney, an early colonial New England silversmith accomplished in the production of both ceremonial and domestic silver.  Coney was the first Boston silversmith to hire a London-trained artisan in his shop.  The timeless popularity of this particular type of domed tankard is seen in two similar Boston tankards made in the late 18th century.  \r\nThe neoclassical oval monogram containing the initials \"MB\" on the front of this tankard was added at a later date.",
