  "description": "Mortuary figures, pair of, representing warriors both wear armor, with curious head-dresses, and one carries a sword-like object. Four of these figures were found at the entrance of a tomb in Honan province. Two bought by M.I.A., and two by the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. They are fashioned of polychromed pottery of the greyish cast associated with Wei. Traces of faded terra cotta color remain. These are unusually large tomb figures.",
