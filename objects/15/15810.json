  "text": "Beneath a crescent moon, a woman sits at the bow of a fisherman’s boat in a river, playing a stringed instrument called a pipa. The scene comes from a famous Chinese narrative poem called “The Song of the Pipa Player,” composed by the poet Bai Juyi in 816 CE. In the poem, a man encounters this pipa player and expresses the sadness he feels when he hears her play her melancholy song. The bottle’s creamy white color is reminiscent of the moonlight mentioned in the poem:\r\nWe drank with depressed heart,\r\nSeeing my friends off while the moonlight bathed in the river.\r\nSuddenly the pipa sounds drifting to our ears from a neighboring boat,\r\nMy guests forgot to leave and I knew not where we were.",
