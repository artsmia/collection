  "text": "This bottle depicts the Eight Treasures of Buddhism—a double fish, a conch shell, a wheel, a vase, a lotus flower, a victory banner, a knot, and a parasol—separated by chrysanthemum blossoms. The Eight Treasures represent the eight-fold path of Buddhism, a series of tenets that, when followed, lead to a virtuous life. They are also believed to be good luck. Along with the chrysanthemum blossoms, a symbol of vitality, this bottle is covered with symbols of good fortune.",
