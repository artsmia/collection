  "text": "Hilda Fearon’s cheerful painting depicts two young girls at the breakfast table on a summer morning. The scene is flooded with bright, clear light, and this is the real subject engaging the British painter here.  Sunlight pours through the windowpanes and curtains onto a white tablecloth and shiny glassware, porcelain, and a silver urn. The green of the garden and yellow-green of the sundrenched lawn are echoed in the interior by daffodils, lemons, and a juice bottle. Touches of blue and gray, instead, describe the shadows on the linens and plates, and stripes and folds of the girls’ frocks. Fearson’s artistic career flourished in Cornwall and then London before her early death at the age of 39. She exhibited her paintings frequently at the Royal Academy. This work, shown at the International Exhibition in Pittsburgh in 1914, was awarded Honorable Mention.",
