  "text": "According to an old inscription, this is a view of Chalk Farm, an area north of London’s center. The body of water is Regent’s Canal, whose towpath was a favorite haunt of Algernon Newton. Much of this area has changed drastically since World War II, and we have been unable to identify the exact location of this view. Can anyone help'\r\n\r\nNewton earned the nickname “The Regent’s Canaletto” for his calm, exacting rendering of architecture and its reflections. The name links him to Giovanni Antonio Canal, commonly known as Canaletto, a great 18th-century artist who earned his fame for his watery views of Venice and who also travelled to London to paint cityscapes.\r\n\r\nThe name Newton may ring a bell among watercolor fans. In 1832, Algernon’s grandfather Henry Newton co-founded Winsor & Newton, purveyors of watercolor paints.",
