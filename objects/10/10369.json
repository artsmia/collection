  "text": "J. Meyer Lebolt established the retail jewelry firm of Lebolt and Company in Chicago in 1899.&nbsp; In 1912 he added a silver shop to meet the demand for handwrought silverware, offering clients moderately priced handmade goods in the popular styles.&nbsp; Lebolt may have modeled his shop on the Marshall Field and Company Craft Shop just down the street.&nbsp; The Lebolt shop at first offered tea and coffee services and flatware in simple Arts and Crafts styles with hammered surfaces.&nbsp; After the First World War, the firm expanded its line to include traditional Gothic and Georgian styles as well.&nbsp; The metal shop closed during the Second World War as a result of metal rationing, but the jewelrly company is still in business.",
