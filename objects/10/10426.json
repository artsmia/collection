  "text": "According to Japan's indigenous belief system, natural phenomena such as ancient trees, unusually large rocks, mountains, and waterfalls were evidence of divinity and worthy of worship. Thus, artists have long painted images of waterfalls as religious icons. In addition, paintings of waterfalls became popular decorations within domestic interiors because of their ability to suggest cool, rushing water, during the intense heat of summer.",
