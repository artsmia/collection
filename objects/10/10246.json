  "description": "covered vase, cat. card does not list 'a-b' for vase and lid; white ground, painted with turquoise and gold circle-and-dot pattern (oeil-de-perdrix); the wide decorative bands are adorned with exotic birds and chinoisirie. The subjects and decorative grounds link them to a pair in the collection of Queen Elizabeth throught to have been bought by Marie Antoinette in 1779. The similar oeil-de-perdix of both pairs may be attributed to Vincent Taillandier, who specialized in this type of patterned ground",
