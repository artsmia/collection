  "text": "…I decided I should take pictures of working class people and contribute to the movements [of the 1930s].  Whatever movements there were -- Socialism, Communism, whatever was happening. And then I saw pictures of [Henri] Cartier-Bresson, and realized that photography could be an art -- and that made me ambitious.   Helen Levitt, the great American photographer of urban life and the poetry of children at play, died on March 29th at the age of 95.",
