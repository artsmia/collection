  "text": "Unlike the standard rectangular wooden boxes that keep cigars at the right humidity, Joseph Heinrichs’s humidor puts form before function. Eclectic decoration disguises its cigar-holding purpose. The bone handle, wire-wrapped arrowhead ornaments, and riveted silver—romanticizing Native American culture and the American frontier—give it a handcrafted look. Made for sale in New York, it may have been intended as a bit of the American West for wealthy city dwellers.",
