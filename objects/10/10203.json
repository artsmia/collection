  "text": "Napoleon commissioned this service in 1807 and presented it to Prince William of Prussia in September of 1808.  Each piece in the set is decorated with at least one scene derived from Jean de La Fontaine's fables.  Stories illustrated on the cups include the tortoise and the hare and the fox and the stork.\r\n\r\nThe high quality of all the painted scenes makes this service one of Christophe-Ferdinand Caron's greatest achievements while working as an animal painter at Sevres between 1792 and 1815.  Caron studied plants at the botanical gardens in Paris as well as books on various animals and birds to create detailed scenes of the fables.  \r\n\r\nThe forms of the objects demonstrate the taste for antique Grecian designs which had begun before the French Revolution and continued under Napolean's reign.  The cups imitate an ancient Greek kyatos, distinguished by their elevated and elongated handles.",
