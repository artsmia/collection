  "text": "George Grant Elmslie began drawing up plans for the Capitol Building and Loan Association in 1918, but construction did not begin until 1922, after the firm of Purcell and Elmslie had been dissolved. By this time Prairie School was fast losing ground to modernism. But in the windows for Capitol Building and Loan, Elmslie still used repeated geometric forms and colors to unify the interior and exterior. This window features circle motifs and rectangles of varying size, reminiscent of the windows in Frank Lloyd Wright's Avery Coonley playhouse (1912).",
