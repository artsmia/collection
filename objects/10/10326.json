  "text": "Fukurokuju is one of the Seven Gods of Good Fortune (<I>Shichi fukujin</I>), a group of deities adopted into Japanese mythology from China as early as the 15th century. Fukurokuju's distinguishing feature is an elongated cranium, probably suggesting the vast wisdom he accumulated over his long life. Because Fukurokuju was emblematic of longevity, this charming painting of him would have been appropriate to display at tea gatherings conducted to mark the beginning of a new year. In this way, the host could bestow wishes for good health and long life on his guests.",
