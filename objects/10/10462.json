Keppel, Bishop of Exeter. Maria, the second, married in 1759 James, second Earl Waldegrave, and in 1766 the Duke of Gloucester (1736-1807). Charlotte married in 1760 Lionel, fifth Earl of Dysart (1738-1789). The boy, Edward, who became Colonel Walpole, died unmarried, aged thirty-one, in 1771.\r\nThe bird in the painting is a Cuban Amazon parrot, either imported, or the artist may have copied it from a book.",
