  "text": "The shepherds dwarfed by the tree at right illustrate a favorite Dutch idea—humankind’s insignificance amid the forces of nature. Gerard van Nijmegen learned his art by making highly detailed watercolors after works by the great masters. In this case Nijmegen copied Jacob van Ruisdael’s oil painting Waterfall in a Hilly Landscape (1670s), a work Nijmegen owned.",
