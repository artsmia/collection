  "text": "This cup and saucer is from a tea service for twelve (the rest is on view in Gallery 310) that was a diplomatic gift from the Emperor Napoleon to Prince William of Prussia in September, 1808. This richly-decorated service is an excellent example of of porcelain meant to impress another head of state. To achieve such quality, Sèvres employed top animal painter Caron from 1792-1815. The paintings on the service (including the bird shown here), based in part on Jean de la Fontaine's Fables, are considered among his highest achievements.",
