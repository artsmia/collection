  "text": "How do you visualize time? For the Polish artist, Roman Opalka, time was more than the calendars and clocks we use to set our daily lives. Time was the pulse of his life approaching his death within the vastness of infinity.\r\n\r\nFrom the very first moment until the day he died, when he had reached well past 5500000 (no commas marred his work), Opalka's daily task was to paint numbers and whisper their names into a tape recorder. His day would end with a simple photograph of himself next to the completed painting. Each work was called a “detail” and all had the same title, “Opalka 1965/ 1-∞.",
