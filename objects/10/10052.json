  "text": "Eating with utensils crawling with lizards, insects, and marine life might seem unappetizing, but the theme displayed on this place setting appealed to the era’s fascination with the beauty of the natural world. Each fork, knife, and spoon is unique, reflecting nature’s infinite diversity in a massive 157-piece service meant to serve twelve. The experimental mix of bronze, gold, and copper metals highlights the variety of flora and fauna, while the patterns continue onto the reverse side of each utensil, and the raised decoration can be felt as well as seen by diners.",
