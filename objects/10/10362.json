  "text": "Diaz was a member of the Barbizon group that included Jean-François Millet, Constant Troyon and Théodore Rousseau. In addition to his landscapes, which were much vaunted by the emerging Impressionists, Diaz also painted mythological, literary and fête-galante subjects in a rococo-revival style notable for its brilliant color effects.  Diaz was an admirer and patron of Delacroix who mentioned him on numerous occasions in his Journal.",
