Bradstreet remodeled his rooms according to his own taste for the exotic, and Volk depicts him seated among turkeywork carpets and Moorish-inspired architectural elements and furniture.\r\n\r\nConservation of this picture was made possible by a generous contribution from Paula Vesely through the Art Champions program.",
