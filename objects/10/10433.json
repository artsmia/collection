Private collection, England (until 1962, sale, Sotheby's, London, April 4, 1962, no. 56, as \"Portrait of Dr. Penrose,\" for $3,360, to Wildenstein [3]; [Wildenstein and Co., London and New York, 1962–66; sold to Mia] \r\n\r\n[1] Philippe Borde (MIA Bulletin, 1971) suggests that Gauffier kept the portrait himself until his death on 8 Feb, 1851. He held the vicarship in Writtle-cum-Roxwell from 1814 to his death, and pursued a Doctorate from Oxford in 1818. Borde also says that the history prior to the Sotheby's sale is not known, but most probably the painting was sold by heirs of the sitter, who is identified in the auction catalogue.\r\n\r\n[2] See Letter from Brinsley Ford, Feb. 9, 1966, object file\r\n\r\n[3] Copy of auction catalogue in curatorial file.
