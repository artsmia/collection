Private collection, England (until 1962, sale, Sotheby's, London, April 4, 1962, no. 56, as Portrait of Dr. Penrose, for $3, 360, to Wildenstein [3]; [Wildenstein and Co., London and New York, 1962–66; sold to Mia] \r\n\r\n[1] Philippe Borde (MIA Bulletin, 1971) suggests that Gauffier kept the portrait himself until his death on 8 Feb, 1851. He held the vicarship in Writtle-cum-Roxwell from 1814 to his death, and pursued a Doctorate from Oxford in 1818. Borde also says that the history prior to the Sotheby's sale is not known, but most probably the painting was sold by heirs of the sitter, who is identified in the auction catalogue.\r\n\r\n[2] See Letter from Brinsley Ford, Feb. 9, 1966, object file\r\n\r\n[3] Copy of auction catalogue in curatorial file.

  "text": "Louis Gauffier moved to Rome after the outbreak of the French Revolution but fled in 1793 to escape reprisals against the French following the execution of Louis XVI. He settled in Florence, where he specialized in grand tour portraits. His painting of Thomas Penrose (1769–1851), secretary to the English envoy to the duke of Tuscany, is among his most celebrated. Gauffier portrayed the young Brit as a sophisticated dilettante, with a sketchbook in hand, taking in the landmarks of Florence—the Duomo, Orsanmichele, and Palazzo Vecchio—from a shady corner of the Boboli Gardens. When Napoleon’s troops invaded Florence in 1800, Penrose was forced to return to England. He became a vicar but kept this exquisite memento of his Italian years his whole life.",
