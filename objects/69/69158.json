  "text": "The palmette motifs Alexandre Eugène Prignot incorporated into this Neo-Grec interior should be com-\r\nPared with similar decoration found in the Etruscan Table in the center of this gallery, which Prignot designed for the firm Jackson and Graham for their display at the 1878 London International Exhibition.\r\nFollowing in the tradition Grammar of Ornament, the influential design source book Owen Jones published in 1856, Prignot published several surveys of designed ornament between 1851 and 1879. He executed pen and ink preparatory drawings, which were then photographed for reproduction. The Institute acquired four original drawings Prignot made for his 1878 publication on architecture, decoration, and furniture, including this one of a doorway flanked by a pair of chairs.",
