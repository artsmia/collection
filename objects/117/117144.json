  "text": "A residency in New York City, a metropolis that lacked a lacquer tradition, made Kofushiwaki realize it was difficult for people there to grasp the overall concept of his work. To encourage an understanding, he chose to create works based on motifs that would resonate with the locals, such as flags and boats. This wall sculpture, commissioned in 2013, is modeled after his original flag series but is twice the size of those he made in New York.",
