  "text": "Yoshitoshi was one of the last masters of <i>ukiyo-e</i> in the Meiji period. A pupil of Utagawa Kuniyoshi (1797–1861), he also studied with Kikuchi Yōsai (1788–1878), a master of historical painting. Yoshitoshi merged the <i>ukiyo-e</i> style with Western realism to produce a new form of print for the modern audience. His historical and heroic prints were often bizarre and ghoulish. Here, only the eyes of the ghost shine ominously in pale blue.",
