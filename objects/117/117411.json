The lingering perfume now has withdrawn from the wood. / Spring has followed the river’s flow, full of burgeoning fragrance; / In daytime they enlivened the courtyard, where shade was rich and green. / The palace beauty – her chambers cold – the sound of her song so sad; / The fledgling swallows – their tower empty – the shadows of curtains, deep. / One thing to enjoy – as old age comes, social ties cut off; / Along the flowered path, now there’s no sight of footprints left by geta.)
