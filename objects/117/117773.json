  "text": "This two volume design collection plays with designs presented in the square format of traditional picture or poem cards. It was published by Tanaka Jihei’s firm Bunkyūdō. The title <I>Shikishi moyō</I> 志来し模様 only phonetically refers to those cards, which were usually made of sturdy, sometimes colorfully dyed paper, but the characters imply a different meaning. Maybe the publisher chose the unusual characters for the title because he wanted to emphasize the creative process of designing. Volume one features 32 images, including two color prints in green and orange, while the remaining designs and the 30 images in volume two are depicted in monochrome ink woodblock print. The designs include images from nature imagery, such as waves and plant motifs, but also some abstract patterns.",
