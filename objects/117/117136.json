  "text": "After a successful career as a Western-style figurative painter, Kokuta changed direction in the 1950s, shifting into the world of abstract painting. He also became well known for his unconventional, bold, and powerful calligraphy, which reflects his study of Zen Buddhism, a variant of Buddhist religion that emphasizes meditation and the sudden awareness that comes in moments of insight.\r\n上下左右　直前直後　前後裁断　風狂歳月　衆法合成　万有包合\r\n生命根源　差異存在　体驗破壊　青山運歩　東山水上行　石女夜生児",
