  "text": "This transparently lacquered light wood tray with a silver frame is decorated with the design of an old pine tree, painted by Kamisaka Sekka. In Japanese iconography, the pine tree serves as a symbol for winter and for longevity. Here, used as a decorative element, it is reminiscent of the decorative Rinpa style of painting, revived by Sekka after its peak in the 1700s. The pine’s trunk features the typical puddle ink technique (tarashikomi) of that style.",
