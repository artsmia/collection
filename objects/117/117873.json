  "text": "In Japanese iconography, the pine tree is a symbol of winter and longevity. Here, used as a decorative element, it is reminiscent of the Rinpa style of painting, revived by Kamisaka Sekka after its peak in the 1700s. The pine’s trunk features the typical puddle-ink technique (tarashikomi) of that style.",
