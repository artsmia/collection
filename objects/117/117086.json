  "text": "In 2008 Murata introduced the series Living Ornamental Hairpin. His inspirations for these works in red or black lacquer, often decorated with pieces of shell, were the woodblock prints from Japan's Edo period (1603–1868) that portrayed high-ranking prostitutes. Considered celebrities in their time, these women wore stunning robes, and their hair was adorned with elaborate pins and needles.",
