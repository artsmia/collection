  "text": "This simple tobacco set would be placed as a courtesy in the covered seating area outside of a tea house. The trays are sparsely decorated with rolling waves rendered as sketches of silver against a black ground. The set was regularly used, as evidenced by the light underpinnings of red showing through where the black overcoat has worn away, and the remnants of tobacco ash in the celadon ceramic jar.",
