  "text": "Designed by the Rinpa artist Kamisaka Sekka, this simple tobacco set would be placed as a courtesy in the covered seating area outside of the tea house. The trays are sparsely decorated with rolling waves rendered as sketches of silver maki-e against a roiro ground. The set was regularly used, as evidenced by the light underpinnings of red showing through the black overcoat and the remnants of tobacco ash in the celadon ceramic jar.",
