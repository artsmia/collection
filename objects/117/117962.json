  "text": "Followers of the Pure Land sect of Buddhism believe that at the moment of death Amida Buddha will descend from his paradise to receive the soul of a faithful follower. This painting depicts Amida floating downward on clouds. He is accompanied by two attendant bodhisattvas, enlightened beings who postpone becoming buddhas in order to help living beings gain salvation. The bodhisattva at left is Seishi, whose hands are clasped in prayer, and at right is Kannon, who holds a lotus. It is believed that the dead will be received upon this lotus and transported to Amida’s paradise by the sacred trio.",
