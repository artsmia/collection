  "text": "As Muramoto continued to refine his technique for the Wing of Foliage series, he eventually made larger foliage wings, which he detached from the wall in order to produce freestanding lacquer sculptures that express movement, delicacy, and tension. For this large exemplar he won the Yamamura Shin’ichi Award at the 2012 Ishikawa International Urushi Exhibition in Kanazawa. He integrated a bamboo twig over the entire length of this delicate work, the surface of which is partly decorated with a fine gold pattern.",
