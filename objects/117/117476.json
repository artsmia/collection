  "text": "A pair of small birds have alighted on the branch of an old tree at water’s edge. A dusting of snow—delicately painted using gofun, a white pigment made of ground oyster shells—has fallen on the tree and chrysanthemums in bloom below. Little is known about the artist, who affixed his large red seal reading \"Geiai\" at upper left. Probably active in Kyoto at the end of the 1400s, Geiai’s extant body of work reveals his fluency in several different styles of Chinese bird-and-flower painting introduced to Japan in the 1300s and 1400s. The unique composition (with all the motifs gathered at left), heavy contour lines, and distinctive texturing of the rocks suggest that Geiai took as his model a painting by a member of the Zhe school, a group of painters that flourished in China’s Zhejiang region during the Ming dynasty (1368–1644) and many of whose paintings were exported to Japan.",
