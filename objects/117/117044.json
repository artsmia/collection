  "text": "Futamura creates tubular forms on a wheel and applies white porcelain slip (liquid clay) to the surface before further manipulating the clay, which causes the slip to separate and crack. After firing, her sculptures often have a charred appearance, like burnt firewood. Futamura first trained in Seto-style ceramics, an ancient pottery style focused on traditional forms like bowls and vases. She moved to France in the mid-1990s which separated her from the orthodox, male-dominated world of traditional Japanese ceramics. This allowed her to explore her art more freely than she might have been able to had she set up a kiln in the Seto region.",
