  "text": "This painting depicts the death of Sakyamuni, the historical Buddha, in 438 B.C. The Indian prince turned sage is shown lying on his side, having delivered his final teachings. At the moment of his death, the Buddha was said to enter nirvana. Around him are his disciples in monks’ robes, a group of five bodhisattvas with golden-yellow skin, guardian deities, monks, laymen, and animal beings. All are shown expressing profound grief. The square “Kunju” relief seal dates this painting to a time before Itchō was exiled to a small island in Izu province in 1699.",
