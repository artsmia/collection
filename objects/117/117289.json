  "text": "Kameda’s cursive calligraphy brings forth a vivid scene of a ship mooring in haze as slender and continuous lines meander through the paper. Kameda completes each character in just two strokes without frequently dipping his brush into the ink stone. This approach led to a certain scratchiness toward the end of each stroke as the brush ran out of ink, an effect known in calligraphy as “flying white.” Kameda’s four-character signature on the left-hand side follows the same mode of dexterous brushwork, and its vertical positioning complements the horizonal arrangement of the subject.\r\n霧舫\r\nHazy Mooring",
