  "text": "Little is known about Kawamura, a woman calligrapher who was active in the early twentieth century.\r\nBorn in modern-day Shizuoka prefecture to the west of Tokyo, she was born into a scholarly family who focused on Chinese literature.\r\nKawamura excerpted this enigmatic statement from a poem by the Chinese poet Du Fu: “I come close up to recognize the elder in Emei Mountain, he knows my principle that laziness is truth.” In the original poem, Du Fu expresses his lack of interest in pursuing secular wealth and power. Kawamura displays her knowledge of Chinese poetry and\r\ncalligraphy in these three characters, written in clerical script.\r\n懶是真\r\nLaziness is Truth\r\n",
