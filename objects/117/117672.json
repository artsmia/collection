  "text": "This small folding screen is a so-called tea screen. It surrounds the heater used to simmer water during tea gatherings to shield the surroundings from charcoal fire sparks. The decorated side faces the attendants. While sometimes more flame-resistant materials like green bamboo or wood are used, this particular example is, somewhat impractically, made of paper and decorated opulently with four gilded paper fans mounted on the silvered surface. Each fan is decorated with motifs taken from the natural world: cherry blossoms, red chrysanthemums with blue balloon flowers, a pine tree, and a breaking wave.",
