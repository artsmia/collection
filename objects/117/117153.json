  "text": "This pair of folding screens depicts eleven scenes from the Tale of Genji. Rather than presenting the scenes in the order in which they appear in the Tale, however, the artist presents them from right to left, as East Asian viewers would read them, in seasonal order. The artist begins with mid-spring in the upper right corner, where a group of young men play kemari (a soccer-like game that was popular in classical Japan) in a grove of cherry trees in full bloom, a scene from chapter 34 of the Tale. Five additional scenes in the right screen take place in late spring and early summer, while autumn grasses and maple leaves announce the arrival of fall in the far right panels of the left screen. Wintry scenes from chapters 6 and 51 are depicted at far left, where trees and rooftops are blanketed in snow.",
