  "text": "A European, a Japanese, and a Chinese man sit around a table. As the European has a book showing a skeleton, he is believed to be the German doctor Lorenz Heister (1683–1758), whose writings circulated in Japan in the mid-18th century. Kōkan is considered the father of Western-style painting in Japan, and this painting is attributed to him even though no other works by him have this style of signature and seals.",
