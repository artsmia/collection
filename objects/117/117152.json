  "text": "The Tale of Genji (Genji monogatari) is Japan’s most famous work of literature and is thought to be the world’s first novel. Written in the 11th century by the court lady Murasaki Shikibu (c. 973–c. 1014 or 1025), it chronicles the fictional Prince Genji and his descendants, focusing on the aristocratic life and spirit of the times. Depictions of scenes from the story have been found on decorative elements within the homes of the educated and elite. \r\n\r\nChapter 34: New Herbs I (Wakana) \r\nPrince Genji’s nephew, Kashiwagi, is depicted here playing kemari, a courtly version of soccer, together with Yūgiri, Genji’s son, and some other friends under blooming cherry trees, the symbol of spring. During this game Kashiwagi and Yūgiri both catch a glimpse of Onna San no Miya, Genji’s young wife, when a Chinese cat lifts the curtain to her quarters. Such exposure was very compromising for a high ranking lady, as she was not supposed to be seen by males outside her immediate family at all. After this incident Kashiwagi falls passionately in love with her and a fatal affair ensues.\r\n\r\nChapter 17: The Picture Competition (E-awase)\r\nThe scene in the lower right corner shows Genji and his pupil and later wife Murasaki commenting on old and new pictures with several courtiers. As the picture competition continues, Genji’s picture diary from his exile in Suma is praised.\r\n\r\nChapter 9: Heartvine (Aoi)\r\nIn this episode, the Kamō-River ceremony, an important Shinto ritual, is held and the courtiers swarm out in their carriages to watch the spectacle. Genji’s pregnant consort, Lady Aoi, decides to join the ceremony at the last minute. While pushing their way into the festival scene her attendants seriously damage another carriage, which turns out to belong to Rokujō, who was Genji’s lover.\r\n\r\nChapter 13: Akashi\r\nDuring Genji’s exile in Akashi, the governor of Akashi encourages him to make advances to his daughter, as he wishes to raise his status through an advantageous marriage. The relationship is not greatly successful because of ",
