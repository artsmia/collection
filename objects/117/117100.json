  "text": "Mano Kyōtei began his training in the studio of Kawanabe Kyōsai (1831–1889), whose painting Wisteria Maiden and Demon Priest is hanging nearby. Kyōsai was known for his originality, versatility, and irreverent style in life as well as art. After his master’s death, Kyōtei studied under Kubota Beisen (1852–1906), who was known for incorporating modern (and Western) techniques and training methods into studio painting in Kyoto. The dynamic composition and combination of humor and pathos with which Kyōtei portrayed his subjects are perhaps the legacy of his early teacher. In this work, Kyōtei depicted the demon slayer Shōki as a calm but strong figure.",
