  "text": "After a successful career as a Western-style figurative painter, Kokuta changed direction in the 1950s, shifting into the world of abstract painting. He also became well known for his unconventional, bold, and powerful calligraphy, which reflects his study of Zen Buddhism, a variant of Buddhist religion that emphasizes meditation and the sudden awareness that comes in moments of insight.\r\n天道地靈 \r\nGod of Heaven, Spirits of the Earth",
