  "text": "Diagonal strokes of ink wash convey the trajectory of rain, while unpainted areas indicate the presence of mist floating through the trees and mountains. The treetops bend sideways from the force of the wind.\r\nNakabayashi Chikutō was a leading literati painter in the late Edo period and had many students, including Imaōji Yūzan (whose work is on display nearby). The two paintings share a similar scene, with a small bridge in the foreground and a man in a straw raincoat walking across it. The inscription at top left reads as follows:\r\nMisty rain clings to the mountains\r\nThe rising water marks reached the path\r\nDamp winds blow the evening clouds\r\nLost is the southern village tower",
