The Wisteria Maiden steps on the back of a demon priest to pull a branch of wisteria, ignoring his rapturous gaze and using him as no more than a footstool. \r\nThis scroll was formerly in the collection of Josiah Conder (1789–1859), the “father of western-style architecture in Japan,” who became a pupil of Kyōsai.",
