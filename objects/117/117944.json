  "text": "Fukami Sueharu uses a signature combination of bluish-white glaze and high-pressure slip-casting technique for porcelain to create his milky blue porcelain sculptures. Fukami was inspired by qingbai wares, a type of porcelain produced in Jingdezhen and other kiln sites in China during the Song (960–1279) and Yuan (1280–1368) dynasties, that was characterized by a blue-green tint on a white body. \r\nFukami used the same mold to produce multiple objects, just as a printer can create several nearly identical prints from the same plate. Fukami developed this form in 1990 for an exhibition and later used the original mold to create this particular piece in 2004.",
