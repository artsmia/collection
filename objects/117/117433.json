  "text": "Urakami Shunkin was the oldest son of Urakami Gyokudō (1745–1820), the most famous painter in the history of Okayama prefecture. At the age of 16, Shunkin left Okayama and eventually settled in Kyoto, the most important city for painting at that time. Although many Japanese Nanga (literati) painters created works based on or inspired by old Chinese and Japanese masters, Shunkin is known to have used his own sketches drawn from real life as the basis for his finished works.",
