  "text": "Covered boxes like this are often used to serve the small cakes provided during tea gatherings to cut the bitter taste of the green tea powder. This kashibako, designed by Kamisaka Sekka, hints at the wabi aesthetic, which prizes naturalistic or imperfect objects. Though the box’s smooth, round shape stands in direct contrast to the rustic ceramics favored by wabi style practitioners, the rough grain of the wood is retained on the outside of the piece. The exterior of the container is covered in a thin coat of clear lacquer, lending the natural wood a glossy finish, while the lid is coated in black lacquer with a design of gentians in silver and gold.",
