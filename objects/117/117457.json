By leaving the area between the trees in the foreground and the mountains unpainted, Fukuda Kodōjin not only creates a sense of depth, but also generates a misty atmosphere.\r\n\r\n\r\nDrinking  alone, wine beside the flowers,\r\nspring breezes fluttering the lapels of my robe. \r\nWith just this peace my desire is fulfilled,\r\nwhile the world’s affairs leave me at odds.\r\nWhite haired but not yet passed on, \r\nThese green mountains a good place to take my bones. \r\nWho understands that this happiness today\r\nlies simply in tranquility of life'",
