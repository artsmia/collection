  "text": "Kamisaka Sekka designed this suzuribako—a box for calligraphy utensils—with colorful gentians but it was crafted by Ichinose Kohei, who engraved his signature on the inside. It is transparently lacquered to bring out the grain of the light paulownia wood, and the joints constructed of wooden pegs therefore remain visible on this object. Removing the lid reveals an insert for holding brushes and writing accessories. Underneath is space for the ink rubbing stone, which is glazed in green with a rabbit design, and the ribbon-shaped water dropper, glazed in yellow with a flower design.",
