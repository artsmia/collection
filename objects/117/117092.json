  "text": "Although these paintings now exist as a pair of folding screens, this is not how Kano Naonobu designed them. He originally designed them as sliding wall panels. One of the ways you can tell is by looking closely at the far left panel of the right screen, where at the left edge you can see a telltale round repair in the paper surface. This was where one of the door pulls originally was. In that original format—essentially movable, floor-to-ceiling murals—they would have surrounded the room’s occupants, giving them the sense of being immersed in nature.",
