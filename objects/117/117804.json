  "text": "Kazunobu, a recently re-evaluated painter of the famous Kanō school, received prestigious commissions from Buddhist temples and was honored by the Imperial Court in 1856 for his talent with the honorary title “Hokkyō” (Bridge of the Law). His work features Western techniques, such as foreshortening, along with traditional Buddhist motifs. His last commission for the Zōjōji Temple is his great masterpiece: 500 rakan depicted in 100 paintings. The set of 16 rakan to which these two examples belong is an important and rare precursor.",
