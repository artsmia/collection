  "text": "Someya unites modern pop art with traditional lacquer craft in his figurative, playful sculptures. Commissioned for the Clark Center, the back of this bull has the shape of Mount Fuji with its peak rendered in red, relating to the red sun of Japan's national flag. He decorated his work with a wide array of motifs from Japanese culture ranging from the past to the present but incorporated also elements that relate to California like Mount Whitney, the state flag, gold, and a Route 66 sign out of which emerge Japanese pine trees.",
