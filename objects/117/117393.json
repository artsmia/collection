We laugh at those hurrying birds. / So loud! We love the flashing lightning. / Heaven now expunges the darkly brooding; / Man begins to gaze up at vast sky. / In the garden out back, they gather oranges, / Along the stream in front, pluck the purple moss. / At the southern window, we invite guests to drink, / Under clear skies, snowlight glittering deep in our cups.
