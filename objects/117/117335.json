  "text": "In East Asia, it was and to some extent still is common practice to use a seal in place of signatures on personal documents and official paperwork. The seals were carved in seal script and show the name of the owner in full or in part. They were made of many materials, including semi-precious stones, wood, and metal, and since they could get damaged from use it was normal especially for artists to own more than one seal. \r\nThis is an assortment of seals used by the painter, poet, and calligrapher Murase Taiitsu.  He may have created this compilation out of a feeling of pride, to show the number of seals he uses, or it may have been made later by an appreciate student or heir as way to remember Taiitsu and his accomplishments.",
