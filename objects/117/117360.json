  "text": "A Nagoya native, Chikutō moved to Kyoto in 1803. He copied the styles of the Chinese masters, including Ni Zan (1301–74), one of the “Four Great Masters of the Yuan Dynasty,”who used a simple composition and sparse brushwork for his landscape paintings. This scene echoes the work of Ni Zan in its stony riverbank, lonely hut, and trees in the foreground.",
