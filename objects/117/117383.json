  "text": "Kameda Bōsai was a scholar, artist, calligrapher, social commentator, and poet; highly respected among literati circles but regarded as non-conformist by the administration. His popularity among collectors and his fellow artists is attested to by the number of forgeries of his work in circulation. “Longevity” was written after his long-failing health suffered a sharp decline. Although he was then partially paralyzed and struggling to speak, Bōsai’s celebration of his unexpected longevity in the style of a waka (Japanese-style) poem is among the most visually lyrical of his body of work. He begins on the right with an ink-soaked brush that bleeds luxuriantly into the silk. The following verse is written in a fine, loose cursive script.\r\n壽　わがトしにあや / かれかしとは / おこがまし / いされどもことし / 七十に\r\nLong Life / To say that others should reach the same age would be / Quite presumptuous. / Nevertheless, this year I have become seventy-two! \r\n(Trans. Stephen Addiss)",
