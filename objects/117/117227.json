  "text": "This dramatic painting shows a dragon generating rain and lightning above a violently thrashing sea. The dragon is fierce and formidable, and the waves seem to be corresponding to his power. The painting was created using the so-called “reverse-saturation” method, meaning the background was painted with ink, while areas in the foreground were left unpainted to depict the clouds and waves. This gives the scene a highly mysterious, ethereal atmosphere, emphasizing the awe-inspiring power of the dragon.",
