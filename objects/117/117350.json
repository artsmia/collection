Now it is the summer of 1849. My elder brother [close friend] Ōkubo of Tsujiura Domain requested a poem from me. I am touched by his high acknowledgement, and hence wrote this poem in response. It is for my elder brother’s pity and care on my [undecipherable]. I do not dare to show people.\r\nHumbly, Fujita Hyō [Tōko]\r\n",

  "text": "This work is a rubbing, an impression of inscriptions carved into stone made by placing a sheet of moistened paper over the surface and tapping with a ball of cloth soaked in ink. For centuries, rubbings played an important role in transmitting calligraphy because it allowed for accurate reproductions of not just the content but also the writing style.\r\nThis work preserves a poem by Fujita Tōko, a Confucian scholar. Fujita was exiled in 1844 when his lord Tokugawa Nariaki was forced into retirement. In the poem, Fujita\r\nexpressed his devotion to the cause of restoring power to the Emperor, a sentiment that ultimately grew among samurai and led to the Meiji Restoration.\r\n三決死矣而不死，二十五回渡刀水。\r\n五乞閒地不得閒，三十九年七處徙。\r\n邦家隆替非偶然，人生得失豈徒爾。\r\n自驚塵垢盈皮膚，猶余忠義填骨髓。\r\n嫖姚定遠不可期，丘明馬遷空自企。\r\n苟明大義正人心，皇道奚患不興起。\r\n斯心奮發誓神明，古人有雲斃而已。\r\nThree times [I was] prepared to die, but did not.\r\nTwenty-five times [I] crossed Tōsui [Tone River].\r\nFive times, [I] sought a quiet place [to retire] but did not obtain\r\ncarefreeness.\r\nIn thirty-nine years I moved to seven places.\r\nThe rise and decline of a state is not by chance.\r\nHow could the achievements and disappointments of life be\r\ntrivial'\r\nThe dust and filth that covers [my] skin surprises me.\r\nThe loyalty and justice that still remains fills my whole bone and\r\nmarrow.\r\nDo not expect Piao Yao* and Ding Yuan**\r\nVainly plan by myself like Qiuming*** and Maqian****\r\nIf [I can] reveal the great cause and rectify the human spirit\r\nThere is no worry that the way of the Emperor will not begin again.\r\nThis spirit is stirred; I pledge to the gods.\r\nAs the ancients say: [I am determined to fight] until my dying day.\r\n*Huo Qubing (140 bc–117 bce), Chinese general\r\n**Ban Chao (32–102 ce), Chinese general\r\n***Zuo Qiuming (556–451 bce), Chinese historian who wrote The Commentary\r\nof Zuo (Zuo Zhuan)\r\n****Sima Qian (c. 145–c. 86 bce), Chinese historian who wrote the Records of the\r\nGrand Historian (Shiji)",
