  "text": "Two doves are sitting close to each other in a blooming Mountain Japanese Apricot tree. They almost disappear in the massive tree with many young twigs, part of which is slightly covered behind a band of fog. Between 1924 until 1956 Onda Tokuju participated numerous times in various art exhibition-competitions in Japan, including the government-sponsored, prestigious Nitten. His 1924 debut work was Mountain Japanese Apricot (<i>Yabai</i>) that is stylistically and compositionally very similar to this work which won the Bronze Award at an exhibition of the Japan Art Association.",
