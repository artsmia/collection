  "text": "The painting is by Okada Hankō, who was one of the third generation of Nanga artist, and the calligraphy on the upper left is by Hankō’s father, Okada Beisanjin, who a Nanga painter and scholar in Chinese classics.    His father, literati artist Okada Beisanjin painted more eccentric works that broke away from the Chinese model.  Hankō was more tradition-bound in his painting, and much more conventional in his lifestyle. Next to Hankō’s signature on the lower right, it states in the style of Wan Shigu, commonly known as Wang Hui. 王翬 (1632- 1720)：清代の人。字は石谷。王鑑の弟子。石谷の画は南北両宗を筆端に溶融し、二王（王鑑、王時敏）の外に於いて別に画流を開き、その功力の深さは古今に比なく、時に画聖と称せられる。",
