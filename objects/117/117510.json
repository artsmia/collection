  "text": "Morning glories climb and coil along a bamboo fence. Open spaces between the clusters of deep-blue blossoms and green leaves, painted with heavy mineral pigments, are interrupted by the vine’s coiling tendrils and Chinese characters brushed in ink. The remaining paper surface is covered in gold.\r\n\r\nThe specific shape of this painting tells us that it was once an elegant, handheld folding fan. The wooden ribs of the fan were removed in order to transform it into a hanging scroll, leaving vertical creases across its surface.",
