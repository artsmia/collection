  "text": "With their spindled backs, contoured seats, and lathe-turned legs, Nakashima’s chairs reference American vernacular furniture, the rustic designs of the colonial era. The New Chair emphasizes simple construction, functional form, and the trees that provided the wood—American black walnut for the seat, legs, and top rail; hickory for the spindles. These characteristics are shared with the furniture of the early 1900s Arts and Crafts movement, seen in this gallery, as well as Scandinavian modern design. \r\n\r\nThe influence of Japanese furniture can be seen in the visible construction and open, modern forms. Nakashima traveled to Japan and studied with a Japanese craftsman while in an internment camp in America during World War II.",
