  "text": "In 2000 Kurimoto began using pre-manufactured automobile hoods as a substrate, or base, for his lacquered wall panels. This marked a radical departure not only from work by other artists but also from his previous series. In these works, seen here, he unites the mechanically made hoods with lacquer, a natural material, to make a philosophical statement. He selected car hoods because they function as a cover, rather the way clothing does. He decorated them with abstract and geometrical patterns; the circle shape, for instance, is a fundamental, globally understood design element, suggesting the Sun and Moon.",
