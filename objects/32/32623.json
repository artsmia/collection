  "text": "Max Ernst's second collage-novel presents the story of an adolescent girl who loses her virginity on the day of her first communion and so commits herself to a religious vocation as a Carmelite nun. The collages, fashioned from images cut from Victorian penny novels and popular books on science and nature, are visualizations of her subconscious desire and the sinful and fantastical nightmares she experiences that night. Ernst includes a line of ironically pretentious text with each image. One of the foremost proponents of Surrealism, Ernst produced a number of similar graphic novels during his career, all of which resist rational interpretation.",
