  "text": "Natalia Goncharova's lithographs are executed in a primitivist style based on traditional Russian icon painting that inspired numerous contemporary painters and printmakers.\r\n\r\nThe curious arrangement of the text and illustrations at right angles to each other suggests that the book may have been intended to be produced in a smaller format. Aleksei Kruchenykh's Hermits consists of a pair of lengthy poems, consciously written in the style of Russian folk-poetry, which recounts life in a hermitage. The author evokes in surreal literary images the repressed blasphemous and erotic inclinations of the residents.",
