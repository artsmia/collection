  "text": "Henri Matisse created his illustrations for this project before the author’s text had been completed. The story, written by his son-in-law, Georges Duthuit, was a fictional account of the meeting between a modern civilized society and a \"primitive\" one, that of Cimmérie, which he based on North American Inuits.\r\n \r\nBecause of the nature of the subject, Matisse relied upon second-hand sources for his illustrations: photography, films, reference books, and Inuit masks.",
