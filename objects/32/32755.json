  "text": "This intimate, handcrafted artist's book features a collection of observations on dancers and their bodies made by various dancers and choreographers. Morin uses computer modified figurative drawings, typographical abstractions, and folded, three-dimensional paper collages (pop-ups) in establishing an eclectic visual dialogue with a series of prose excerpts chosen by Catherine Vaucher. The book's resemblance to a private journal or diary underscores the frequently personal nature of the text.",
