  "text": "The training of birds of prey for hunting and sport has a long tradition in Japan. As in many other countries, falconry was a pastime of the aristocracy and high-ranking warriors, and the ability to handle birds was an admired skill. During the Edo period (1600-1868), master falconers (<I>takajo_</I>) were accorded special rank within the samurai hierarchy. Because of his exotic profession, evident from the majestic bird held high on his arm, the falconer attracted great attention. He was among the first secular subjects painted by O_tsu-e artists during the 17th and early 18th century.",
