  "text": "This small figure represents a warrior, recognizable by his conical hat and decorative collar. The hat's bumpy surface shows his connection to reptiles and their abilities. The warrior is depicted at rest, crouching with hands resting on his knees. His left foot is firmly placed on the ground, however, suggesting readiness to move and act at a moment's notice.",
