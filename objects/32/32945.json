  "text": "This marble bracelet vaguely imitates the shape of a conch shell. Archaeology in the Lopburi-Pa Sak river basins in central Thailand has verified the importance of shell ornaments to early bronze age inhabitants. Conch shells, large enough for bracelets had to be imported from coastal settlements into this region making them relatively precious objects. It is likely for this reason that the more common white marble, despite the difficulty in carving it, was fashioned in the form of a conch bracelet suggesting a more prestigious material.",
