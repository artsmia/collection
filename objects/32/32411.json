  "text": "The Japanese have long delighted in the idea of animals parodying human actions. In this painting, the cat daintily offers a hot pepper with his chopsticks, knowing that it will make the foolish mouse gulp his sake. Oblivious of danger, the mouse tips the red and black cup to his lips. In the foreground stands a double gourd, used to decant the strong rice wine that is the cause of the mouse's reckless abandon and, ultimately, the cat's good fortune. The inscriptions reinforce the moralistic theme of the work: disaster awaits those who forget themselves and drink too much: \r\n\r\nMore than just deceived, [the mouse]\r\ngleefully dances, and then is caught\r\n\r\nThe mind that does not heed danger\r\ncauses the body to be caught\r\n\r\nUnwittingly befriended by the cat\r\nwho plies him with sake\r\nthe mouse drinks, slurp, slurp\r\n\r\nThose who imitate the sages' teachings\r\nwill eventually ruin others' lives.",
