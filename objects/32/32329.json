  "text": "The striking originality of Congolese Kuba textiles results from an aesthetic that emphasizes experimentation and innovation within the framework of traditional geometric patterns. This skirt is unusual in that the appliqued panels alternate with densely embroidered squares of geometric motifs, providing dramatic contrasts of form and texture. It consists of numerous small panels pieced together to create a garment over 12 feet in length. The making of this kind of textile, a joint effort of men and women, could take several years.\r\n\r\nThis dance skirt was an important prestige object, worn by a high-ranked woman on festival and ceremonial occasions. It was wrapped over an inner skirt to form a voluminous, many-layered spiral.",
