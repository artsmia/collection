  "text": "It took several women many years to make this ceremonial skirt. It consists of numerous small panels pieced together to create a garment more than 12 feet long. On special occasions, it was worn over an inner skirt to form a voluminous, many-layered spiral. The striking originality of Congolese Kuba textiles is the result of an aesthetic that emphasizes experimentation and innovation within the framework of traditional geometric patterns. This skirt is unusual in that the appliquéd panels alternate with densely embroidered squares of geometric motifs, providing dramatic contrasts of form and texture.",
