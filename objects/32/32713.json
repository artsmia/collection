  "text": "Roar Shocks borrows freely from various scientific treatises on the Rorschach procedure, a diagnostic tool developed in the 1920s by Swiss psychiatrist Hermann Rorschach to assess personality traits. Sometimes called the \"ink blot test,\" the procedure was once the world's most famous psychological experiment, though it would later be criticized for its subjectivity and questionable reliability. In a compelling series of black and white images, Rathman dissects, alters, and recombines portions of the ink blot treatises to create his own visual \"experiment.\"",
