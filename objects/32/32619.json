  "text": "The Qur’an (Koran), the holy book of Islam, contains the divine revelations of God as revealed to the Prophet Muhammad. For Muslims the Qur’an is not only the word of God, but also a guide to a way of life. This portable Qur'an from Persia, is opened to pages describing Hajj, the pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca (in present-day Saudi Arabia), one of Islam’s five essential practices. All Muslims who are physically and financially able to do so must make this pilgrimage at some point in their lifetime.  \r\nChapter 22, verse 27 reads: “Proclaim the Pilgrimage among humankind: they will come to you on foot and on every lean (beast of burden); let them come from every deep ravine.” \r\nEvery year around three million Muslims take part in the Hajj, which involves many rituals in and around Mecca.",
