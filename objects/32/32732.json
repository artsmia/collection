  "text": "At the end of the 15th century, the new industry of book printing reached its zenith in Nuremberg, Germany. Anton Koberg's firm operated twenty-four presses and employed a hundred editors, proofreaders, and typesetters. The most elaborate book created by Koberg was the Nuremberg Chronicle of 1493. It was written by Dr. Hartmann Schedel and recounts the history of the world from Creation to the early 1490s with lessons in religion and geography intermingled with unusual and interesting facts and phenomena. Koberg published 1500 copies of the book in Latin and an additional 1000 copies in German. The copy on display is from the first Latin edition. This edition was more carefully laid out and printed because it appealed to a more learned audience. The Chronicle contains 1809 prints taken from 645 actual woodcuts, resulting in 1164 repetitions. The woodcuts were created in the workshop of Michael Wohlgemut, who was assisted by his stepson Wilhelm Pleydenwurff. In addition to his work on the Chronicle, Wohlgemut is famous as the instructor of Albrecht DÃ¼rer, who some scholars believe contributed several images to this book",
