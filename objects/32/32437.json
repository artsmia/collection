  "text": "The Five Dynasties (907-960) and Song dynasty (960-1279) period saw a tremendous increase in the production of fine white porcelaneous wares. During the preceding Tang dynasty (618-907), kilns located at Qicun in Linchang district of Hebei province developed the refined Xing works that are considered the forerunners of the classic white Ding wares of the Song dynasty. This delicate, thinly potted dish bears a precisely molded floral design that is probably based on the decoration found on contemporary silver utensils. It is a well-preserved example of early Song white ware.",
