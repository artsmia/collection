  "text": "The deep bowl of this food-offering vessel is set on a high slender foot with matching cover to form a sphere. The upper half has three faceted projections that serve as tripod legs when the cover is turned over for use as a bowl. All elements are decorated with fine linear scroll motifs, fretwork patterns, and triangular panels that vaguely recall earlier bronze styles and motifs.\r\nWith the dispersal of wealth and political authority during the Eastern Zhou (c. 770–256 BCE), the number of local foundries increased and workshops developed regional styles. Variety was a hallmark of the era. This vessel was made in the State of Yan (in present-day Beijing). Artisans looked to earlier bronze-casting traditions and revived certain elements of animal-based decoration like the cicada-inspired triangle panels on this dou.",
