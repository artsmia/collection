  "text": "This simple, abstracted bird shaped stone appears contemporary, yet was made thousands of years ago by a Native American artist in North America. Smooth and graceful, this delicate-looking Bird Stone was used as a ceremonial weight for a hunterâ€™s atlatl (spear-throwing device).  The beauty embodied in this tool may have been carved as an emblem of prestige, a marker of coming of age, a supernatural talisman or as a clan symbol in addition to its utilitarian purpose.  These stones were often made from distant materials, another indicator of their importance.",
