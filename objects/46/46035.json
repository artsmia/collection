  "text": "Istanbul, Turkey, straddles the narrow Bosporus strait, with part of the city in Europe and part in Asia. Emma Bormann’s viewpoint puts us on the European side, identifiable by the Dolmabahçe Mosque at the bottom of the print. The darkened spires seem to connect us visually to the Asian side across the water. \r\n\r\nBormann developed a unique carving style based on tiny digs and gouges, evident in the sparkling lights on the distant hills. Digging was in fact crucial to her earlier occupation: she earned a doctorate in archaeology and anthropology from the University of Vienna, one of the first women to do so. In 1917, saddened by the death of her father, a professor of Roman history, she left Vienna for Munich, where she carved her first woodcut.",
