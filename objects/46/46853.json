  "text": "Vessels like this <i>meiping</i> vase represent a peak in the decorative technique of blue-and-white wares, combining the freedom and energy of a newly emergent art form with the sophistication of maturity. An exuberant five-claw imperial dragon serves as the central motif, projecting an air of majesty and power as it strides around the surface of the vessel. Four frontal lion masks, alternating with stylized clouds, decorate the shoulder. The scale and imperial imagery of this magnificent vase suggest a formal use within the halls of an imperial compound. It was likely one of a matching pair of vases used to create balanced, formal arrangements in the large rooms of the Forbidden City, the imperial palace in Beijing.",
