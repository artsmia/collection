  "text": "Decorated shirts were worn on the Plains by men who were highly regarded within their community.  Created by women, this honor garment was a prestige item that represented the accomplishments of the owner.  Over time a shirt can get damaged through use, and the beaded strips could be transferred to a newly created one, such as on this example.  The body of this shirt is made of wool trade cloth that was created in Europe.  The artist cleverly cut the undyed portion of this garment in order to have a two-color fringe, adding to the overall aesthetic effect.",
