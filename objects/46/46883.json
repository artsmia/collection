  "text": "This ink landscape bears the inscription:\r\n<P><I>Viewing the waterfall at Shiliang. During the early autumn of the year 1738 during the Qianlong reign era, I painted this for submission to the judgement of my venerable elder brother, Zhang Geng from Xiushui.</I>\r\n\r\n<P>Attended by a servant bearing wine and a drinking cup, a scholar with staff pauses while crossing a stone bridge to gaze out on a serene landscape. Shiliang or Stone Bridge is the name of a famous cave in Zhejiang province that is approached by a natural stone bridge. It is the theme of many paintings. The man most likely portrayed here and the recipient of this painting was Wang Yuzeng (1706-1762), born in Xiushui, Zhejiang province. He was a calligrapher who earned his <I>Jin Shi</I> (doctorate) degree in 1754 and served as a secretary in the Ministry of Justice in Beijing. The artist, Zhang Geng, was a younger friend of Wang's and from the same town in Zhejiang.",
