  "text": "Among Hockney's most familiar and iconic subjects, the swimming pool is in many ways synonymous with the Southern California lifestyle that the artist embraced after first arriving in Los Angeles in 1964 at the age of 27. Demonstrating an interest in a casual realism, he depicts his own hand-painted pool, focusing on color, light, reflection, and transparency to evoke the memory and sensation of our shared experiences and knowledge of swimming pools. The color lithograph is one of eleven prints of the subject Hockney made at Tyler Graphics between 1978 and 1980.",
