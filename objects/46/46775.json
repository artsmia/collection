  "text": "French art historian Emile Mâle noted that in the fourteenth century, the crucified Christ was shown convulsed into an exaggerated S-curve, with his legs sharply bent. As preoccupation with Christ's suffering grew, artists decided it was more moving to portray a stretched figure with pronounced ribs, as in this marvelous metalcut. \r\n\r\nThe colorist's hand-painting was less successful here than in the 1499 woodcut Christ on the Cross with Mary and Saint John; the angel hovering near the side wound appears to have nothing to collect in his chalice, confusing the sense of this print.\r\n",
