  "text": "A variant of the basic box-shaped pillow is the so-called ingot shape which resembles in profile, the general form of a Chinese silver ingot. This work displays a subtle, moulded design under its green and amber <I>sancai</I> glaze that simulates a brocaded textile. It may be that the pillow is actually meant to replicate a type of fabric covered cushion or pillow.",
