  "text": "A variant of the basic box-shaped pillow is the so-called \"ingot shape\" which resembles in profile, the general form of a Chinese silver ingot. This work displays a subtle, moulded design under its green and amber sancai glaze that simulates a brocaded textile. It may be that the pillow is actually meant to replicate a type of fabric covered cushion or pillow.",
