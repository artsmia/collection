  "text": "Both Job and his friends are silenced because neither has convinced the other and they have no further dialogue. Elihu enters the discussion. He is moved to wrath against Job for justifying himself instead of God and even more his friends for condemning Job. As indicated by his posture, his arguments are drawn from the astronomical universe: his left hand points to the stars, which are also rendered in the margins; his left foot is advanced. He confirms that God and his universe are too great to be comprehended, yet God has a special care for mankind. This is common knowledge yet Elihu's words immerse Job in deep thought; could there be a Redeemer'\r\n\r\nJob's sleeping Humanity appears in the lower margin with soaring angels striving to awaken him.",
