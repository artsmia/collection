In the center of this red lacquer eight-lobed square form dish are three scholars playing a board game. They are surrounded by an eight-lobed reserve carved with sprigs of lingzhi fungus on a star-diaper ground. The cavetto (or inward curve) is carved with sprays of flowering plants against a yellowish-brown plain ground. The exterior is carved with a classic or \"fragrant grass\" scroll in tixi technique.",
