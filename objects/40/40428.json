  "text": "American dancer Loie Fuller (1863–1928) developed her own modern dance in Paris in the 1890s, becoming famous for her “Serpentine Dance,” which created its effect from the swirling motion of her fluid garments. On November 5, 1892, Fuller made her debut at the Paris music hall the Folies Bèrgere. She designed a special podium with movable mirrors and rows of colored lightbulbs. She overwhelmed the audience with this kaleidoscopic combination of light, color, and motion. The French sculptor François-Raoul Larche designed several Fuller lamps, including this one, to capture the spirit of her famous dance.",
