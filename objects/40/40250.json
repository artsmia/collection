  "text": "The brown-toned cubist design on Teague's striking Cubist-inspired camera and box design is a reflection of the period's artistic trends. It is also an example of the more geometric, early phase of Art Deco, which designers largely abandoned in favor of the sinuous streamlining that characterized most American products in the 1930s and 1940s. This decorative enameled camera with matching box was a \"Gift Kodak\" camera available in 1930-31, and surely was the height of gift-giving at the time.",
