  "text": "Until it filed for bankruptcy in 2012, the Kodak name was synonymous with the mass-market camera, film and the rise of the holiday snapshot. From 1928 to 1933 Kodak commissioned the industrial designer Walter Dorwin Teague to modernize the appearance of their products. This art deco camera was marketed by Kodak to fashion-conscious women, advertising it in 1930 as the ideal Christmas present. When the roll of film was finished, the entire camera was sent to Kodak to print the pictures and reload the film.",
