  "text": "The Scottish Rose was a hallmark of the Arts and Crafts movement in Glasgow at the turn of the Twentieth century. The motif is a square which spirals into itself in a series of petals creating a rose, an appealing play of simple shapes. The black linear designs of the rose stems are echoed on and define the elongated handle. The Arts and Crafts movement intially was defined by hand-made objects but as the popularity of the style increased manufacturers stepped in to fill the demand.",
