  "text": "Glass and chrome emerged as favored materials during the 1930s for furniture, but were not often incorporated into tabletop appliances. Rohde’s Z clock, with its floating glass face mounted on a diagonal chrome bar, captures elegance through economy and transparency. With no visible electrical source, the floating glass dials lend an air of mystery. Gilbert Rohde, a lesser-known industrial designer working in the 1930s and 1940s, had his greatest successes with clock and furniture design. His tour of Europe in 1927, where minimal modernism was taking hold, informed his American designs of the 1930s and 1940s.",
