  "text": "In 1928, Karl Hagenauer became director of his father's firm and soon after his designs became increasingly sophisticated. As stylized tree-like forms, this set of candelabra is remarkably avant-garde for its time. The candle arms suggest branches jutting out and up at severe right angles. The overall angularity is softened by the tubular stems in which the intended candles become extensions. As installed, the positive elements and negative space play off one another providing an overall drawing-in-air composition.",
