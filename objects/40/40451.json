  "text": "The angled seat and back offer the comfort of a lounge chair. But that wasn’t what the designer had in mind—he created the chair to explore the idea of furniture as abstract sculpture. \r\n\r\nThe red and blue planes seem to zoom through space before stopping near each other without touching. They rest on a collection of black legs, side rails, and arms with yellow ends, a kind of scaffolding to support the back and seat.",
