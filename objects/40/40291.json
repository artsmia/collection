  "text": "This chair was originally made for the entrance hall of the Tomado factories in Dordrecht, The Netherlands, and is listed as dating from 1950.  Subsequent scholarship, however, tends to suggest an earlier date, possibly 1946.  The chair consists of six pieces of bent plywood of varying thickness, and shares many affinities with the bent plywood chairs of the Finnish architect-designer, Alvar Aalto, and the Charles Eames LCW chair.  As with all the bent plywood furniture of the period, the overriding principles were easy manufacture and assembly at minimal cost to the consumer.",
