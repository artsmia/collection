  "text": "An extremely early and rare design, this complete set of cocktail shaker, tray, and six cups is an example of Wright's geometric, machine-inspired aesthetic characterizing his work in metal.  Wright also created a line for Chase Brass and Copper Company and contracted with several other metal working firms to manufacture his designs in the 1930s. However, it was his own Informal Accessories Line in spun aluminum, also featured in this case, that became his ticket to success.",
