  "text": "Jean Prouvé’s designs are elegant yet practical, revealing his love for construction and engineering, as well as his belief in accessibility (often referred to as “good design for all”). He specialized in creating modern furniture for public spaces, such as government buildings, schools, and hospitals. As a result, he began manufacturing on a large scale in the 1930s, pushing the limits of technology at the time. This table combines plywood with steel, following Prouvé’s principles of using industrial materials",
