  "text": "Sylvia Stave was one of many designers who developed modernist solutions for household objects produced at the firm Carl Gustav Hallberg in Stockholm. She often employed strong geometry in her pieces, reflecting the purity of form practiced by designers at the Bauhaus in Germany, a significant influence on Swedish functionalism. \r\n\r\nThis spherical pitcher is modern, minimal, and functional, yet reflects a European sophistication that appealed to many consumers. The form with its braided wicker handle is similar to Bauhaus designs, but she has added an ingenious device, a counterweight attached to the underside of the lid that allows it to levitate horizontally when tilted for pouring, a brilliant solution in its simplicity and practicality. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
