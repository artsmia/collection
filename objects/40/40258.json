  "text": "These stapling pliers showed how high style fused with efficiency in the office. Its Cubist-inspired design, in enamel on chrome-plated metal, was popular in the early Art Deco period in American industrial design, similar to the Kodak Camera and box, also seen in this exhibition. \r\nFridolin Polzer received a patent in 1934 for this design manufactured by Hotchkiss, whose front can be removed to load a strip of staples onto a guide. A squeeze on the handles quickly staples the paper, and repetitive use did not tire the user as conventional staplers could.",
