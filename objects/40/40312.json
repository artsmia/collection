  "text": "In 1875 Amédée de Caranza arrived at the Vieillard porcelain factory in Bordeaux. During the next ten years, he breathed life into the studio, especially with his Japanese-inspired designs that employed the technique of enameled faience. In this drawing for a large vase, de Caranza energized the surface with a fish and a turtle frolicking in stylized waves.",
