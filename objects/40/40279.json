  "text": "The streamlined form of the Electro-Pointer pencil sharpener makes even this immobile desk accessory look sleek and fast. Early electric pencil sharpeners from the 1910s had an exposed motor, but with the  ElectroPointer, the motor is disguised by a case made of Plaskon, a molded resin that was a practical, modern, and cheaper alternative to heavier die-cast metal cases. The popular model continued to be manufactured into the 1960s by other companies including Swingline. Electric pencil sharpeners continue to speed up a mundane office task.",
