  "text": "現川 Utsutsugawa ware; In a formal tea gathering, a meal precedes the preparation and service of tea. The meal usually consists of soup and rice accompanied by two or three side dishes featuring grilled, simmered, raw, and/or pickled seasonal ingredients. Grilled dishes would be served on large plates and simmered dishes in individual lidded bowls. A third type of side dish, often sashimi (slices of raw fish), was served in small individual dishes placed farthest from the guest. For this reason, this type of side dish and the bowls in which they were served were called <I>mukōzuke</I>, which literally means “placed on the far side.” This set of four <I>mukōzuke<I> dishes were produced at Utsutsugawa, a kiln site in Nagasaki that specialized in dishes, bowls, and incense containers for the tea ceremony.",
