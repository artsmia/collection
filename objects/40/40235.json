  "text": "In 1912 Jean Dunand traded his extensive knowledge of metalworking for Seizo Sugawara's well-kept lacquer-working secrets, then parlayed them into an astonishing series of lacquerwork.\r\n\r\nDunand's signature style is his use of eggshell lacquer particles of crushed eggshell were painstakingly placed into a fresh lacquer. So successful did this beome that Dunand maintained his own flock of chickns to provide eggshells of suitable quality and color.",
