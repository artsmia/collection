  "text": "Robert Bonfils’s iconic poster, featuring a stylized gazelle and nymph, announces the 1925 international Paris fair, a showcase of avant-garde architecture, industrial design, and decorative art. Besides its presentation of the latest in applied arts, the six-month exhibition helped popularize the term “Art Deco,” coined to describe a modern design style characterized by a streamlined classicism, geometric symmetry, opulent ornamentation, and sleek machine-age materials.",
