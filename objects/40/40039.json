  "text": "Gyokuran was the wife of the great Nanga artist Ike Taiga, an example of whose painting is also on display in this gallery. While Taiga exerted considerable influence on her development as a painter, she advised him on the writing of <I>waka</I> poetry. In this painting, Gyokuran's spirited brushwork brings fresh vitality to the commonly encountered subject of chrysanthemum flowers. Her use of the angled brush, seen in the broad outlining strokes of the rock, recalls one of Taiga's favorite techniques. Nevertheless, the painting has a playful  flamboyance unique to Gyokuran.",
