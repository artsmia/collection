  "text": "The lacquer foundation of this tray consists of yellow, green, and red colored layers. By carving down to varying depths the artisan was able to create a multi-color effect. Called ticai (carved colors), the technique had been available since Song (960-1279), but it wasn't until the Jiaqing reign (1522-66) that it became popular, reflecting perhaps the taste for colorful overglaze porcelain that marked this era. The interior of the tray is carved with two sinuous, five-claw dragons with horns, whiskers, and bushy tails. They confront a yin yang symbol set within a flaming shou (longevity) character. The two long sides depict two dragons in profile confronting a flaming pearl; the two short sides feature single dragons chasing the famous pearl of wisdom.",
