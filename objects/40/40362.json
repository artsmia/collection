  "text": "Piet Zwart’s poster advertises an avant-garde film festival at The Hague in Holland, with offerings from nine countries. International film festivals were a new attraction in the late 1920s and signaled the emergence of film as a form of modern art. As a designer, Zwart was particularly influenced by the geometric arrangements and primary colors common to the modernist De Stijl movement as well as the avant-garde typographic experimentation of Russian Constructivism.",
