He too championed the virtues of handmade craftsmanship, simplicity of line, unadorned surface and fumed oak but, unlike them, he acknowledged his debt to European designers, particularly the Scotsman Charles Rennie Mackintosh, as seen in the square cutouts on the side elements in this window bench.",
