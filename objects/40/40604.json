  "text": "Aerodynamically styled with complementary horizontal \"speed lines,\" Paul Shrecken-gost's pitcher makes the most of the stylistic vocabulary of 1930's streamlined design. While appearing spherical, the pitcher is actually flattened with its rounded section only half as wide as it is high. Like many streamline forms-from trains to vacuum cleaners-it reads best viewed from the side. In fact, many such designs were conceived as much for their impact on the advertising page as on the sales floor.",
