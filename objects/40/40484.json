  "text": "Drawing was fundamental to the artistic practice of Oskar Kokoschka, a leading exponent of Austrian Expressionism. Some 5,000 drawings by the artist survive, and colored chalk was a favorite medium. Kokoschka employed vibrant colors in his drawings not descriptively but expressively. He traveled extensively in his later career and gifted many of his later sketches to friends he made across the world. This study was given, and dedicated, to the late Rosalynd Pflaum, whom the artist first met in Minnesota, where he traveled at least three times.",
