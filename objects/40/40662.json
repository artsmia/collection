  "text": "The so-called \"spinning wave\" design comprising the ground pattern of this imperial box is first seen in the middle Qing period. Dragons were associated with both waves and clouds and three are shown against the wave ground on the lid of this quatrefoil presentation box. They are the standard five-clawed variety with sinuous, scaly bodies, horns, and beards common to the late eighteenth century style. The whole scene is carved with great finesse and vivacity in rather high relief. The sides of both box and cover are carved with the same overlapping wave pattern as the top acting, in this instance, as a ground for floating flower heads. The top, side, and base borders are edged with bands of key-fret. While this container does not carry an imperial mark, the dragon imagery with its court associations suggests that this work might be a product of an official Qianlong workshop.",
