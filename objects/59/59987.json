  "text": "This handsome hanging scroll depicts a time-honored theme in the genre of bamboo painting: bamboo in snow. The artist, Fang Guoqi from Kunshan in Jiangsu province was known for his paintings of bamboo done in the style of the Ming artist, Xia Chang (1388-1470). One of the quintessential subjects of literati painting, bamboo painting contains the basic characteristics of calligraphic brushwork. In this case, blank paper representing snow is masterfully integrated into the composition. Because it is an evergreen and a strong plant when mature, bamboo stands for vitality, fortitude, uprightness, and longevity. Withstanding wind, rain, and snow, it bends in a storm but does not break. Bamboo is one of the Four Gentlemen among flowers along with plum, orchid, and chrysanthemum.",
