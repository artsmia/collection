  "text": "Wanda Gág believed that things radiated their own special atmosphere, or “essence” as she called it, and she was always trying to find an object’s hidden essence and express it in her prints. Could Moonlight be a metaphor for her struggle' This field is visible when the moon peeks through the clouds; but the minute the clouds move by, the landscape will be hidden in darkness once again.",
