  "text": "This Confucian poem is written in seal script (chuan-shu) by the innovative calligrapher and critic, Wang Shu. During the Yongzheng era (1723-35), as a result of the revived interest in archaeological and philological studies (Han Xue) which sought authentic sources for ancient texts, Qing scholars began to seriously study the inscriptions on bronze and stone monuments. These ancient inscriptions served as sources for epigraphical studies and expressive calligraphy. Wang Shu turned directly to rubbings of Eastern Zhou (770-256 BCE) and Tang (618-906) masters to develop a style based on the thin, wiry, perfection of ancient seal script. His thin, strong, perfectly even strokes called \"iron wire\" seal script (Tie Xian Zhuan) became a typical product of his generation. The characters in this scroll display a subtle \"modulation\" of ink tone, a rare variant of his classic unmodulated \"iron wire\" stroke.",
