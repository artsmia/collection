  "text": "Wood developed her characteristic lustre glazes to resemble antique pottery she purchased in Holland, and she worked with these shimmering glazes until her death at 105 in 1998. This simple yet stunning gold lustre bowl was made in her 100th year, and the footed bowl nearby shows her characteristic juxtapositions of color and design that envelop the form.",
