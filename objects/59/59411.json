  "text": "Minnesota artist Elizabeth Olds presents a lighter interpretation of working life in this caricature of businessmen scurrying along a New York subway platform. Her gentle satire lampoons their uniformity of dress and action as they hurriedly make their way to the office. Between 1935 and 1940, Olds participated in the Works Progress Administration-Federal Art Project (WPA-FAP) in New York City, a \"New Deal\" program established by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to create employment for artists during the Great Depression.",
