  "text": "Antonio Prieto studied sculpture at the California School of Fine Arts in San Francisco, and ceramics, painting, and sculpture at Alfred University in western New York state, famous as an East Coast ceramics center since the early 20th century. Prieto returned to teach at the College of Arts and Crafts and at Mills College, both in Oakland, California; one of his best-known students at Mills was a young Robert Arneson. His work belies his fine arts background, as he used his pots and plates as blank canvases for his lively graphic and pictorial line drawings; here, abstracted deer romp across a plate form.",
