  "text": "Decorative bronze handwarmers, as well as footwarmers were common in upper-class Ming and Ch'ing dynasty households. Used during the cold months to help warm the extremities, the best of them were made by the leading metal workers of the day. The slightly domed pierced lid of this example is worked as stylized waves with, in bold relief, an old fisherman sitting in his boat. There is a three-character hallmark engraved underneath, ch'i-fu hsuan, which translates as \"Pavilion of the Seven Happiness.\" It was common to mark metal and lacquer objects used in large households with the name of the room, hall, or pavilion in which they were kept and used.",
