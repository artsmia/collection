  "text": "Inkstones began to be carved with decorative designs at least as early as the Song dynasty (960â€“1279). This example has a cover carved with a hibiscus-blossom design within a decorative frame. The relatively naturalistic design was likely inspired by similar themes found in contemporary album and fan paintings. Small double compartment inkstones such as this were often used both to grind black ink and to mix the colored pigments used in paintings.",
