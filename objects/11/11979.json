This ink stone is raised on several droplet-shaped legs with incised decor and there isa a deep groove (bi yong) which acts as the ink well encircling the round, unglazed grinding surface. A similar bi yong style greenware ink stone was excavated at the Luohu kiln site at Fengcheng in Jiangxi province.",
