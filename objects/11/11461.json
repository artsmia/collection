  "text": "Maillol's portrait of his friend, the painter Auguste Renoir contrasts with the majority of the sculptor's oeuvre. He is known primarily for his depiction of female nudes in a formalized manner, which references classical Greek sculpture, much like his <i>Leda</i>. <i>The Head of Renoir</i>, however, provides an intimate portrayal of the artist's friend.",
