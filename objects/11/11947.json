  "text": "It is possible that this is an early example of a Grand Tour bronze, brought back by a young nobleman from England or Northern Europe from his journey to Italy. It is based upon a life-sized fountain figure of Fiorenza (a personification of the city of Florence), which the Flemish sculptor Giambologna made for the Medici villa in Castello near Florence around 1560. Giambologna was inspired for the pose of his figure by an ancient statue type, so it's possible that this caster also wanted to depict Venus--the Graeco-Roman goddess of love--drying her hair after she stepped ashore the island of Cyprus.",
