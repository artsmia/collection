  "text": "Micha Bar-Am's photo from the Six Day War in Jerusalem touches on the theme of spiritual power in the face of violent and politically-charged environs. The man pictured was one of the first paratroopers to reach the Western Wall, a long-standing principal site of Jewish worship prohibited to Jews by Jordanian rule from 1948 until 1967. The photo reinforces religious piety with military power--the bullets draped over his shoulders seemingly transformed into a prayer shawl.",
