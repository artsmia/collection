  "text": "These rare vessels reflect a fundamental change in form and decoration in bronze casting around 900 to 700 BCE. Gone are the animal masks, vibrant animal motifs, and spiral background patterns of Shang and earlier Zhou vessels. In their place is a severe, totally abstract patterning composed of horizontal flutes and “wave” and “shield” bands. The heavy, squat form, as well as the nonsymbolic decoration, epitomizes the so-called Western Zhou style.\r\n<P>Identical inscriptions cast into the lids and cauldrons of both vessels read:\r\n\r\n<P><I>Boxian has made this sacrificial xu vessel;\r\nmay one forever treasure and use it. </I>",
