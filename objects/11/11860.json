  "text": "A superbly modeled chimera comprises the handle of this tiny square seal whose legend, <I>Chen Shang hsin yi</I>, cast on the reverse in negative seal script, may be translated as the personal seal of Chen Shang. Small undecorated seals are known from the Warring States (480-221 BCE) and Ch'in (221-206 BCE) dynasties while more elaborate animal-shaped knobs were popular during Han as the use of official and personal seals became widespread. Seals with tortoise, chimera, ram, and camel-shaped knobs were popular and have been excavated from Eastern Han tombs. In spite of its extremely small size, the chimera on this example is exceptionally detailed and animated.",
