  "text": "Benjamin Franklin (1706-1790) served as a diplomat in France from 1776 to 1778 and wears the simple fur wig that he made famous at the French court. He is portrayed engrossed in his thoughts, ready to seize his quill. Amidst his desk accessories are some dried flower specimens, the second volume of the French 1773 edition of Franklin's writings, \"Oeuvres de M. Franklin\" (Works of Monsieur Franklin), and a Leyden jar condenser, with an electrostatic machine at his feet. \r\n\r\nIdentical versions of Mia's Franklin and Voltaire portraits in Warsaw were attributed to Philippe Curtius (1737-1794), a physician and artist who trained Madame Tussaud in the art of wax modeling. His cabinets of wax works in Paris drew large crowds in the 1770s and 1780s. But he is not known to have worked in plaster, making it more likely that this group was made by a contemporary in his circle.",
