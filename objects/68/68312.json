  "text": "The manmade Mount Tenpō is a famous scenic spot of the city of Osaka. It was created by dredging the Aji River in 1831. Cherry trees and many restaurants covered Mount Tenpō, and this scene is intended to be from an overlook of the Aji River. Here, for entertainment, people climb through two thick pillars, each with a hole, a tradition thought to bring luck and known from the Great Buddha Hall of the temple Tōdaiji in Nara. Climbing through pillars is also portrayed in Jippensha Ikku’s (1766–1831) Strolling along the Tōkaidō  (Tōkaidōchū hizakurige), a comic novel about the misadventures of two travelers",
