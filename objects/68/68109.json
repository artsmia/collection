  "text": "Russian artists responded to the outbreak of war in Central Europe in 1914 in paintings, sculpture, and works on paper. In her print cycle War: Mystical Images of War, Natalia Goncharova depicted all aspects of armed conflict past and present, from the Christian archangel Michael riding triumphantly through flames on horseback to celestial beings observing fighter planes in combat. She realized her apocalyptic vision of war—struggle between good and evil, destruction, and redemption—in powerful lithographs inspired by the solemn gravity of traditional Russian icons and the dynamism of contemporary Futurist painting. Here, she portrays Death, one of the Four Horseman of the Apocalypse described in the New Testament book of Revelation. Carrying a scythe, a traditional symbol of death, the winged figure bestrides a pale horse stepping among the bones of the dead.",
