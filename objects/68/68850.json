  "text": "Deputy Jean-Marie Fruchard (1788-1872) has a place in history thanks to Daumier's entertaining caricature. This lithograph is based on a small portrait bust Daumier made from clay as he watched the debates in the Legislative Assembly. The print takes the caricature much further, accentuating Fruchard's prominent nose by having it hang over his lips.",
