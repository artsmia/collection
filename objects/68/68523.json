  "text": "This print originated in Blois, a French city famed for its watchmakers and enamelers. Patrons typically selected a watch subject from a catalogue of miniature designs, then relied on enamel painters to add color. Religious scenes like this Holy Family Visited by Angels were common. For the enameled band around the side of the watch--the hole is for attaching a metal ring--this print offered a choice of twisted ribbons, crowns, or putti. Watches were more decorative than functional before 1675; that year the balance spring was introduced and timekeeping greatly improved.",
