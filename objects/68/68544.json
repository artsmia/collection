  "text": "This three-sheet set of prints represents the dohyō-ir, or ring-entering ceremony, at the beginning of a tournament day. Takaneyama appears on the left as the tachi-mochi, or sword carrier, one of the two attendants of the wrestler who performs the ceremony. On the right sits Kurokumo, who functions as the “dew sweeper” (tsuyuharai), the attendant who in ancient times would clear the path for the wrestlers. The ceremony itself is performed by a yokozuna, a high-ranking wrestler, in this case Shiranui, in the center. The yokozuna always performs the same moves in the center of the ring, including raising his right foot up high followed by his left.",
