  "text": "A <I>khatvanga</I> or \"tantric staff\" is a ritual object held in the crook of the left arm during ritual ceremonies by Tantric practitioners. The staff symbolizes the ultimate Buddhist state of combined bliss and emptiness. There are two types of <I>khatvangas</>. One has a <I>vajra</I> (thunderbolt) on top like this one representing the male method or compassion. The other has a trident on top signifying the female element or wisdom. There are three impaled heads below the <I>vajra</I>. The uppermost, a skull, or \"dry\" head represents pure body: next a \"damp\" head represents pure speech, and last a \"fresh-cut\" head represents pure mind. Below these are a double <I>vajra</I> and a nectar vase. The <I>vajras</I> represent the four purified elements of earth, water, fire, and air while the vase symbolizes the awareness that the mind is identified with the perfection of wisdom as the \"nectar of attainment.\"",
