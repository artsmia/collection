  "text": "In Chinese popular culture, there has long been a convention of using plants or animals to embody certain propitious meanings. The image of melons-gourds in this case-connected one to another by vines, suggests generations of sons and grandsons stretching on without interruption. The pun comes from the word dai (belt)-the vine-linked melons-that provides a homophone on the word dai (generations).",
