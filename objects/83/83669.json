  "text": "Even a simple quilt design can pack a powerful graphic punch, as this one does with its contrasting color scheme. The Diamond in Square is a longtime favorite of the Amish.\r\n\r\nAmish codes of conduct reject all forms of ostentation, pride, and vanity. Amish quilters therefore use patterns that are simple and feature nonrepresentational geometric shapes. They prefer piecing large fabric components and avoid appliqué. Representational imagery is allowed, however, in the quilting stitches worked subtly across a quilt’s surface. Here, the fine quilting stiches—visible only up close—form feather wreaths, eight-pointed stars, roses, and tulips.",
