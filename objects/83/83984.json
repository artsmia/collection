  "text": "From the series, One hundred Victories, One Hundred Laughs, this print conveys a nationalistic message. Koppi Døjin's text describes Japan's successive victories in a battle after a battle during the Sino-Japanese War (1894-95), and Kiyochika's image shows a Japanese soldier in a black uniform treading on Chinese under his feet. The gray structure under his feet represents the Great Wall. Thus, the print caricatures Japan's rapid advance to the capital.",
