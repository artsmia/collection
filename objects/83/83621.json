  "text": "Hayashi Shotaro_ is the younger brother of the late Hayashi Kotaro_. Both men have been part of the revival of traditionally inspired ceramics from the Mino area of central Japan--long a ceramic production hotbed. After studying with Kotaro_, Shotaro_ established his own studio and kiln in 1974. For this dramatic platter, he was inspired by the grassy green glaze first made popular by the 16th century tea master Furuta Oribe. However, his manner of combing the surface of the clay is thoroughly modern and produces a wide range of color variation as the glaze settles thickly into the deep recesses and pulls thinly away from the sharp peaks.",
