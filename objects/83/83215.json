  "text": "Hanukkah commemorates the victory of the Jewish people over Greco-Syrian rule. This victory included cleansing and rededicating the Temple as well as rekindling the lights of the Temple Menorah. To remember these events, Jewish people continue to light the candles of the Hanukkah menorah, or chanukiah, during an eight-day long celebration. The traditional blessing over the candles is found inscribed on the top portion of this benchform chanukiah: Blessed are You ברך אתה Lord, our God, יי אלהינו King of the universe, מלך העולם Who has sanctified us אשר קדשנו With his commandments במצותיו And commanded us וצונו To light the lights להדליק נר Of Hanukkah של חנכה",
