  "text": "The high shoulder, flat bottom, and wide mouth of this handsome vessel would have made it an effective storage jar. The well-proportioned hand built vessel has been decorated with a strikingly linear design of clustered swirls interrupted by large, round \"eyes\" on a burnished ground. The Majiayao type (3,100-2,700 BCE) is characterized by the severe linearity of its painted designs usually executed in black only, and the meanings of this d√©cor has yet to be determined. This dynamic pattern covers the upper half of the vessel ending just above the edge of the loop handles, one of which bears an applied strip or rippled clay along its spine. The other handle is plain. An urn of similar form and design was excavated in 1977 from Ciqi county in Gansu province.",
