  "text": "When the courtier Fujiwara Kintō (996-1075) designated thirty-six writers from Japan's past as  Immortal Poets, there were only a few women included in the group. Later compilations, however, sometimes featured only women, as is the case with this exquisite album. An unknown artist rendered imaginary portraits of the women, and their poems, within small fan shapes. The women are painted in surprising detail given their miniature scale. A poem by Izumi Shikibu, a 10th century noblewoman, is on the right, and one by Lady Nijō-in no Sanuki (1141?-1217) is on the left:\r\n\r\n<P><I>Living my everyday life\t\t                      I’m at such a loss;\r\n<P>is hard enough\t\t                      Fireflies by the marsh.\r\n<P>without hearing the sad sound\t                      From my breast\r\n<P>of the first cold rain on my wooden roof.\t   wanders out\r\n<P>How easily it comes and goes.\t                      my soul, or so it seems.</I>",
