  "text": "In this lively autumnal scene, five sparrows romp and bicker near millet and blooming asters. The painter used almost no contour lines, opting instead for the so-called “boneless” (mokkotsu) technique that relied on ink wash rather than line to define the subject’s volume and mass. Little is known about the artist, who impressed a red seal reading \"Geiai\" at lower right. Probably active in Kyoto at the end of the 1400s, Geiai’s extant body of work reveals his fluency in several different styles of Chinese bird-and-flower painting introduced to Japan in the 1300s and 1400s.",
