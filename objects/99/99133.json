  "text": "Iroquois women made lavish pincushions that sat on Victorian dressing tables where they held long hatpins.  Others hung on walls to hold pins and needles used  while women sewed.  Victorian women were drawn to these innovative pieces because of their rich colors and ornate floral beadwork.  In the late 19th century, Tuscorora and Mohawk women, building from traditional designs, created a new raised style of beadwork found on many whimseys.  Often these artists used white crystal glass beads in combination with other colors to give contrast and texture to the flowers, leaves, and berries that adorn many pieces.",
