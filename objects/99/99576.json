  "text": "This wristrest is beautifully crafted in the shape of a <I>ch'in</I> or Chinese lute, an instrument long associated with the literati and a symbol of antiquity and scholarship. The craftsmen used <I>lung-yan</I> timber from Fukien province. This wood is famous for its \"tiger stripe\" graining while the form is further enhanced by a row of thirteen ivory inlays resembling the markers on an actual <I>qin</I>.\r\n<P>The top of the rest is carved with a poem by Kuo Shang-hsien in two five-character stanzas, which reads:\r\n\r\n<P><I>My home is without material wealth\r\n<P>The classics are its fertile fields.</I>\r\n\r\n<P>Kuo Shang-hsien was a famous official and calligrapher from Pu-tian in Fukien. He was a scholar, painter, poet, and well-known calligrapher who held several official posts both in Peking and the provinces.",
