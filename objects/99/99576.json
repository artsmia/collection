  "text": "This wristrest is beautifully crafted in the shape of a ch'in or Chinese lute, an instrument long associated with the literati and a symbol of antiquity and scholarship. The craftsmen used lung-yan timber from Fukien province. This wood is famous for its \"tiger stripe\" graining while the form is further enhanced by a row of thirteen ivory inlays resembling the markers on an actual qin.\r\nThe top of the rest is carved with a poem by Kuo Shang-hsien in two five-character stanzas, which reads:\r\n\r\nMy home is without material wealth\r\nThe classics are its fertile fields.\r\n\r\nKuo Shang-hsien was a famous official and calligrapher from Pu-tian in Fukien. He was a scholar, painter, poet, and well-known calligrapher who held several official posts both in Peking and the provinces.",
