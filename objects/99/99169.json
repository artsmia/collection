  "text": "White slip covers the interior and part of the exterior of this small bowl disguising the slightly coarse buff- grey body typical of the Yaozhou kilns in Shaanxi province. A deep brown glaze with six petal lobes is applied over the slip creating a striking flower pattern. This design, made by dipping rather than with a brush, is relatively rare.",
