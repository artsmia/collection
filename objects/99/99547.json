  "text": "The artist Wang Jianzhang’s inscription tells us that he painted this work for his friend Gong Weiliu in 1650, after Gong acquired Wen Jia’s calligraphic rendering of the “Pipa Xing” (“Song of the Pipa Player”), a famous poem. Both Wen’s script and Wang’s painting were mounted together on the same scroll. This famous Tang poem, composed by the poet Bai Juyi (772–846), is one of the great poems of Chinese literature. In it, a man encounters a woman playing a stringed instrument called a pipa and expresses the sadness he feels when he hears her play her melancholy song. Here, Wang depicts the woman standing on a boat in the moonlit river, playing her instrument. Interestingly, she faces away from the viewer, hiding her expression; her sorrow, as well as her beauty, is obscured.",
