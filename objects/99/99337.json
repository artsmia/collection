  "text": "Nuno means fabric in Japanese. True to its name, NUNO Corporation designs cutting-edge fabrics utilizing revolutionary production techniques. Like her mentor Jack Lenor Larsen in the 20th century, NUNO's CEO and artistic director Reiko Sudo (b. 1953) synthesized traditional aesthetics with modern materials (including many made from recycled and eco-friendly sources) and avant-garde surface design practices to create a 21st century standard for textiles. Tsugihagi (patchwork in Japanese) references the quilting technique, albeit in an unusual manner. Like a quilt, the fabric is created as a series of layers all stitched together. Leftover NUNO fabric scraps are cut into squares and randomly placed on a ground fabric of water-soluble cloth. The entire surface is then machine stitched on a grid. When the fabric is washed, the ground fabric dissolves leaving behind a kind of spectral quilt.",
