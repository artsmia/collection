  "text": "Vacuum-steaming aluminum and other metals onto polyester film is the process used to create NUNO's lamé cloths. When removed from the loom, the fabric is cut to form slit yarns for a weaving technique evolved from traditional Japanese gold and silver brocade threads. The design for this fabric was achieved by printing an alkali in specific areas to dissolve the adhered metal surface.",
