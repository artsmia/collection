  "text": "Charm, or amulet, cases often contained sacred prayers, objects blessed by a lama (teacher), or even fragments of a monkâ€™s robe. They were commonly worn by women around the neck and by men attached to a belt or saddlebag. Here, the scrolling filigree work is inlaid with precious stones in the form of a Kirtimukha, or face of glory, meant to ward off evil spirits. The clasp takes the shape of a vajra, or thunderbolt, a symbol of enlightenment.",
