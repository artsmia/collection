  "text": "This <I>tour de force</I> object is decorated with striped lines carefully incised into the globular body and lid while they turned on a lathe.  The fine quality red color of the stoneware resembles authentic Chinese objects at the time, and, as such, was marked on the bottom with a pseudo-Chinese seal mark.  The branch handle and spout are consistent with the prevalent Rococo interest in naturalism during the 18th century.\r\n<P>This pot was probably made to serve punch, an exotic beverage that came to England via India.  The name punch also derives from the Hindi word <I>panch</I>, or five, for the five most common ingredients in the drink: water, citrus, sugar, spice, and alcohol.",
