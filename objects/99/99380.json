  "text": "This tour de force object is decorated with striped lines carefully incised into the globular body and lid while they turned on a lathe.  The fine quality red color of the stoneware resembles authentic Chinese objects at the time, and, as such, was marked on the bottom with a pseudo-Chinese seal mark.  The branch handle and spout are consistent with the prevalent Rococo interest in naturalism during the 18th century.\r\nThis pot was probably made to serve punch, an exotic beverage that came to England via India.  The name \"punch\" also derives from the Hindi word panch, or \"five,\" for the five most common ingredients in the drink: water, citrus, sugar, spice, and alcohol.",
