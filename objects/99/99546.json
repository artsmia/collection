  "text": "Indigo dyed cotton door curtains (noren) were typically hung across the entrances or gateways to homes in traditional Japan. Unlike professionally produced noren for shops and businesses, noren for private homes were typically designed and decorated by the home's mistress. This beautiful example shows a flock of red-crested cranes--long symbols of longevity in Asia--flying amid clouds and standing in a field of autumn grasses.",
