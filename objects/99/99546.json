  "text": "Indigo dyed cotton door curtains (<I>noren</I>) were typically hung across the entrances or gateways to homes in traditional Japan. Unlike professionally produced <I>noren</I> for shops and businesses, <I>noren</I> for private homes were typically designed and decorated by the home's mistress. This beautiful example shows a flock of red-crested cranes--long symbols of longevity in Asia--flying amid clouds and standing in a field of autumn grasses.",
