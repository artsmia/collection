  "text": "Inspired by some old shutters with worn, bent slats, Reiko Sudo tried numerous techniques to reference this quality in a contemporary fabric. After developing several prototypes, NUNO found that working with narrow nylon ribbon sewn to a base cloth could create the desired effect. With some research, connections were made with a cord embroidery company, which made manufacture of the design possible. In 1997, using a water soluble base cloth, the fabric Shutters was produced. The same technique was again employed in 2002 for this fabric, when designers were inspired by rolled up papers as viewed in a spiraling cross-section.",
