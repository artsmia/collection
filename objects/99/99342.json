  "text": "Inspired by some old shutters with worn, bent slats, Reiko Sudo tried numerous techniques to reference this quality in a contemporary fabric.  After developing several prototypes, NUNO found that working with narrow nylon ribbon sewn to a base cloth could create the desired effect.  With some research, connections were made with a cord embroidery company, which made manufacture of the design possible.  In 1997, using a water soluble base cloth, the fabric <I>Shutters</I> was produced. The same technique was again employed in 2002 for this fabric, when designers were inspired by rolled up papers as viewed in a spiraling cross-section.",
