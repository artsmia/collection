  "text": "Match cases were an innovation on similar items of European American manufacture.  Iroquois match cases were decorative items in Victorian homes.  European Americans prized match cases and other whimseys because they illustrated the sophistication of their owners.   Match cases were one of the many items such as sewing baskets, wall pockets, and various embellished cases that women used to make their homes pleasant and neat.   A well ordered beautiful home was an ideal many women strove for during the Victorian era.  Iroquois match cases fit into these homes because of their beauty and utility.",
