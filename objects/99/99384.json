  "text": "Tsubaki Chinzan overcame tremendous adversity to become one of the leading Chinese style painters in 19th century Japan. His father died when he was only seven, leaving him and his mother destitute. Perhaps because of their sordid living conditions, he suffered from a pulmonary disease from a young age. Nevertheless, he eventually became an official spear-bearer and highly skilled in martial arts. He did not become a professional artist until his low wages as a minor military official forced him to seek additional income.  He studied with the renowned painter Watanabe Kazan, who integrated elements of Western realism into his work. Here, Chinzan's close attention to natural detail probably reflects Kazan's influence. The light, lyrical impression created by the \"boneless\" method (without ink outlines) and lush color tonalities, however, reflects Chinzan's own artistic sense and consummate skill with the brush.",
