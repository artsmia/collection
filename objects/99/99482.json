  "text": "Herbert Bayer had a varied career as a photographer, painter, sculptor, designer, and architect. In the 1920s, he studied and then taught at the Bauhaus, Germany's leading design school. After immigrating to the United States in 1946, he concentrated on corporate design and helped the Atlantic Richfield Company (now ARCO) build a substantial art collection. Bayer's photographic specialty was surreal photomontages, like this one, which he made while living in Berlin.",
