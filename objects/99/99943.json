  "text": "These covered boxes and related small vessels reflect the interest in overglaze color that began in the late fifteenth century. The designs and shapes produced in underglazed blue and white around 1500 were also made in polychrome versions. Red and green enamels were used on their own over a clear glaze or in conjunction with underglaze blue designs. Works such as these were very popular export ware especially to Indonesia and Thailand.",
