  "text": "With objects such as this ewer, the short-lived Vauxhall porcelain factory of London satisfied the keen appetite for frilled porcelain in the Rococo style. As a center of craftsmanship, fashion, and government, with a port for shipping and an established retail and wholesale system, London had become an important hub of porcelain manufacturing. London distributors bought prized cargoes of Chinese export porcelain and also domestic-made goods for this lucrative market.",
