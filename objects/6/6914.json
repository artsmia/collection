  "text": "This elegant table originally would have held an incense burner or other ritual object placed before icons within a Buddhist temple. This type of red lacquer, known as Negoro ware, reflects Chinese influence in its overall shape and carved decor. Negoro is made by covering a base of black lacquer with red lacquer. Eventually, areas of red are rubbed away from repeated use, revealing the black beneath. The random pattern of red and black is highly valued by connoisseurs.",
