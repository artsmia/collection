  "text": "Drum-shaped sake casks were produced in Japan as early as the Kamakura period, originally as ceremonial objects. They went on to be used in various religious ceremonies and secular events, including weddings and cherry-blossom viewing parties. These two black-lacquer casks feature drum-shaped bodies on ornamental stands, with small spouts for pouring sake on top. The face of each “drum” is decorated with designs of flowers and grasses executed in red lacquer.",
