  "text": "As a patron of the arts, Amenhotep III sought to recreate the heavenly cosmos on earth, with himself at the center. He ruled a vast empire stretching from northern Syria to Sudan, and during his 38-year rule Egypt was wealthier and more powerful than ever before. In this portrait, he wears the traditional striped royal headdress topped by a double crown representing his rule of both Upper and Lower Egypt (the Nile Valley and the Delta). Above his brow is the sacred cobra that spits poison into the eyes of the kingâ€™s enemies.",
