  "text": "Takahara Shōji was born in Okayama prefecture, where unglazed Bizen ware was traditionally made. He began his apprenticeship at age 17 and learned under two artists who were nationally recognized to be at the forefront of Bizen: Isezaki Yōzan (1902–1961) and Ishii Furō (1899–1964). In 1965, Takahara built his own kiln and became independent. This water container (mizusashi) was used for fresh water during ceremonial tea preparations and is shaped in the form of an eboshi, a formal hat for men.",
