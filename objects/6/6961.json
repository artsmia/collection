  "text": "Efficient simplicity marked early 20th-century design, even in churches, as illustrated by this stark, elongated candlestick made of aluminum and cast from a mold. Lightweight, flexible, and relatively inexpensive, aluminum was a new and ideal material for appliances and decorative objects. Since it resists weathering, the aluminum of this candlestick doesn’t need polishing—exemplifying the time-saving interests of modern society.",
