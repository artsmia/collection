  "text": "Cut from a single sheet of plywood and given its final form without joinery of any kind, Gerald Summer's armchair is audaciously simple in construction. It was manufactured by Summer's own, modestly named London firm, The Makers of Simple Furniture. Today, it represents a textbook example of ingenious problem-solving in industrial design. Despite its apparent simplicity, this chair was difficult to fabricate. As a result, its price was not competitive with the molded plywood designs of its Scandinavian competitors. Its single-sheet plywood form was, however, ideal for tropical climates where traditionally joined furniture was subject to separation.",
