  "text": "Monju, the bodhisattva of transcendental knowledge, was particularly revered among Zen Buddhists. In this painting by a Zen monk-painter, Monju’s wisdom is at its purest—he appears as a young boy with wispy hair, wearing a gold crown and earrings, and carrying a book of scripture. Active as a monk and semiprofessional painter at the monastery Tōfukuji in Kyoto, Kichizan Minchō and his followers built an influential painting studio specializing in the production of Buddhist images, both traditional, heavily pigmented icons as well as ink paintings like this one. Minchō was among the earliest Japanese Zen monk-painters to master the technique of monochrome ink painting, which had originated in China. He helped shape the early development of this art form in Japan, as his works and those of his followers circulated and became important models for other Zen painters active at monasteries farther afield.",
