  "text": "Oropallo's Fall from Grace is a feminist approach to the tale of the six wives of England's King Henry VIII. Published in an edition of 20, the accordion-bound book features six excerpts from the poem \"Kings and Queens\" by Eleanor and Herbert Farjeon. Oropallo pairs each text with a portrait printed as a color monotype-a one-of-a-kind print-that she has manipulated on the plate before the final printing. These portraits are not intended as likenesses of the king's wives, but rather serve to remind us that these unfortunate women were once like us, living, breathing, feeling human beings.",
