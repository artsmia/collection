  "text": "Perfectly proportioned, geometric, abstract—ancient Puebloan pottery appears almost modern. Thin black lines precisely painted on white surfaces look as though they might have been done by computer instead of with small brushes of yucca-plant fibers. Likewise, the animal designs on Mimbres pottery (1000–1200 CE) are minimalist, stylized figures, cleanly painted on curved surfaces. The smaller pots to the right have the same ageless quality as the ancient ceramics but were made in the 21st century by Acoma artists, descendants of the Ancestral Puebloan people.",
