This set would have likely belonged to a woman of the warrior class, gifted given to her as part of her wedding trousseau. Women of the elite class were expected to read Tthe Tale of Genji as part of their education so they could participate in social activities, such as card games (karuta), shell games (kaiawase), as well asand poetry composition. The mMotifs on the exterior of this box contains referencesrefer to chapter Chapter 14, in which Genji travels to Sumiyoshi shrine.\r\nBeyond the elite circles, The Tale of Genji was popular among women partly because textbooks for girls often featured the classic. Such texts focused not on the content, but rather on the poems and major plotlines so they readers could identify references.",
