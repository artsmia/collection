  "text": "Genji imagery was particularly common on women’s furnishings like this cosmetics and accessories case. Here, the motifs on the box’s exterior allude to scenes from chapter 14, only they do so without human figures. On the lid, the carriage, shrine gate, and arched bridge collectively suggest Genji’s pilgrimage to Sumiyoshi shrine, while the boat on the front of the box points to the arrival of one of Genji’s former lovers who, by chance, was also on a pilgrimage to Sumiyoshi. These same four elements can be found on many painted illustrations of this scene.",
