  "text": "The kantharos (plural, kantharoi), a type of drinking cup with two high loop handles and a deep bowl, is particularly associated with Dionysos, the Greek god of wine and vegetation. Its horizontal handles make this cup unusual, since they more closely resemble those of a shallower type of cup known as a kylixthan those of other kantharoi. Since few ceramic examples of kantharoi survive, it is believed that they were more usually made of bronze, silver, or gold. Metal examples, often destroyed by corrosion or melted down for other uses, are also rare.",
