  "text": "Tokoname, located south of Nagoya in Aichi prefecture, was one of Japan's great pottery-making centers, producing large numbers of capacious storage jars. Tokoname's iron rich clay produces a rich brown hue when fired. This jar also displays an unusually heavy deposit of natural glaze which resulted when wood ash settled on the vessel's shoulder and liquefied in the heat, running down the sides in dramatic, uneven rivulets.",
