  "text": "A light-colored glaze descends from the wide neck and covers the sloping shoulders of this storage jar from the Tokoname kilns. Named for the town of Tokoname on the Chita Peninsula south of Nagoya, Tokoname ware has been produced since the eleventh century at a number of kilns in the vicinity of the town. The high iron content of Tokoname clay leads to a characteristic dark, red-brown surface.",
