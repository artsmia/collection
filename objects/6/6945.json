  "text": "Jacques Le Chevallier’s  lamps were meant to shock. They are brazenly functional, showing off their machine-like construction of inelegant flat metal shapes held together by unconcealed screws. The angled panels act as light diffusers. Le Chevallier created at least seven lamp designs in the late 1920s and strove to make each one sculptural, functional, and unique.",
