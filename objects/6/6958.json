  "text": "The industrial character of Jan Eisenlöffel's metalwork held a strong appeal in pre-World War I Germany where certain advanced designers and manufacturers sought to develop designs for machinery and mass production. Today, he is best remembered for his various teakettle designs, this kettle-on-stand being one of them. It was intended to be placed at the side of the dining table facilitating the pouring of hot water without interrupting dinner.",
