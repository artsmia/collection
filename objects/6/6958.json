  "text": "Eisenlöffel designed this teakettle according to industrial era ideals: save time with efficient design. With the kettle placed conveniently on a stand beside the table, hot water could be poured while conversation continued uninterrupted. Eisenlöffel’s sleek brass example anticipates the mass-produced designs of pre–World War I Europe, especially Germany. The splayed feet, added for stability, were his playful trademark.",
