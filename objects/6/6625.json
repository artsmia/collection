  "text": "鍋島 Nabeshima ware\r\n\r\nThe blue and white medallion pattern upon which the fans appear to float was created by a technique called “resist-drawing, ” whereby a design is drawn in ink and then completely covered with a layer of cobalt-blue glaze. During firing in the kiln, the ink burns away, taking the cobalt blue with it and leaving the type of white-on-blue pattern seen here.",
