  "text": "Sometimes art is produced by a single individual, and at other times it takes a team of specially trained artists. For hundreds of years, French tapestry artists have worked cooperatively with painters to create large wall hangings which reflected the aesthetic of their historic period.  Painters created the tapestry design, which was called a model. The model was enlarged by tapestry workshop artists to the dimensions needed for the finished hanging. This drawing, called a cartoon, was used as a guide by the weavers. This interaction between specialists has proven so effective that it is still used today.\r\n\r\nFor this tapestry, Conrad Marca-Relli, who works with paint as well as collage, created a tapestry model similar to the piece to your right.  The weavers have used line, color and texture to express the spirit of the artist image.",
