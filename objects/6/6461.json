  "text": "Soon after monteiths first appeared in England, Chinese potters copied them in porcelain from either a metal example or wooden model.  This monteith resembles silver examples from the 1680s. Sources from that time indicate the term monteith was inspired by Monsieur Monteigh, a Scotsman known for wearing a scalloped edged cloak.  The monteith's scalloped rim was designed to hold the feet of wine glasses, so they could  be chilled or rinsed in cool water between uses.  Without their detachable rim, silver monteiths could also serve as punch bowls.",
