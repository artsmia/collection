  "text": "Although the designer of this 1920 teapot remains unknown, it is no less intriguing. Its angular form conveys an immediate sense of modernity, yet, the medium of hammered pewter recalls the conservative Arts and Crafts table accessories designed for British trade at the turn of the century. The resulting blend of past, present, and future, Cubist modernity with a dash of British eccentricity, remains as arresting today as it must have been in the mid-20s.",
