  "text": "It may resemble a guitar and sound like a lute. But with five strings running perpendicular to its sound box, rather than strung across it, this is a harp—a bow harp, in fact, owing to its shape. A century ago, among the Nzakara people in Central Africa, court poets praised—and sometimes critiqued—the deeds of past and present kings to the accompaniment of a bow harp.",
