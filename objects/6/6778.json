  "text": "In 1932, Jack Pritchard founded Isokon (Isometric Unit Construction) principally to produce inexpensive furniture.  Walter Gropius became the Controller of Design three years later.  He, in turn, hired fellow Bauhaus colleague, Marcel Breuer, as the firm's leading designer to develop a series of furniture to be made out of bent plywood.  Breuer's work with the material (which was new to him) led to organic designs oriented toward human anatomy, a decisive break with the aesthetic of his metal furniture.  In his brief association with Isokon, Breuer designed five pieces.",
