  "text": "In Buddhist ritual, the burning of incense before a holy image is one of six devotions considered to be effective in accruing religious merit. The diffusion of fragrant smoke symbolizes the permeation of Buddhism throughout the universe. This elegant example consists of a middle chamber which holds hot coal, a bottom chamber for ash, and the upper portion into which a powdered incense or a piece of fragrant wood would be placed. The dome is decorated with a pierced design of drifting clouds while the knob takes the shape of a wish-granting jewel or lotus bud.",
