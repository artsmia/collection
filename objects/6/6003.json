  "text": "Li Shan, the painter of this landscape has long been considered one of the most innovative of the group of artists known as the \"Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou.\" A talented writer, Li was appointed to service in the Imperial Academy in the early 1720s. A rather dissolute lifestyle led to a loss of his inherited fortune however, and by 1726 Li was living in Yangzhou in the Tianming temple struggling to earn his living as a professional artist. Li evolved a personal style based on heavily textured brushwork that gave primacy to purely aesthetic values. The present landscape is one of at least four extant paintings that were originally part of the same album. These works all show the influence of the famous artist Ba Da Shan Ren (1626-1705), a personal friend of Li Shan. The inscription reads:\r\n\r\nGreen trees grow thickly, shading mountain cottages,\r\nI don't know if people are present in the\r\nsmart-weed blossom village;\r\nI thought carefully the whole night through\r\nand with rain from the river's source.\r\nWashed forth the blue mountains\r\nwith close-knit dots and lines.\r\n\r\nThe Daoist from Ao",
