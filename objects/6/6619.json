  "text": "Yosa Buson was one of the two greatest painters of the Nanga school (the other being his contemporary, Ike Taiga). Buson was also one of the most important poets of the Edo period, and the lyrical quality that permeates many of his paintings is often attributed to his poetic sensibilities. Here, in painting a raucous flock of mynah birds alighting a tree, Buson's loose, impressionistic brushwork enlives his composition.",
