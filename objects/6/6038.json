  "text": "For centuries painters and weavers have worked in close collaboration to create portable murals called tapestries. In the 20th century one of the most famous tapestry weaving centers was in the French town of Aubusson. Abstract expressionist painter Paul Jenkins frequently explores the nature of prismatic light and color, using competing hues to reinforce a feeling of movement, and his works have inspired weavers on more than one occasion. This piece, after Jenkin's painting Phenomenon: Peel of Bells Cross, captures not only the intensity of color but also the almost watery look of the application of the pigment on the original canvas. In addition to the change of scale, the use of the tapestry form adds a distinct feeling of softness to the energy of the line work.",
