  "text": "This photograph of a peace rally in Israel is part of David Seymour's work focusing on the emergence of the State of Israel (which was recognized in 1949). Seymour is known for his photojournalistic work from the Spanish Civil War (1936-39). In 1947, along with Henri Cartier-Bresson, Robert Capa, George Rodger, and William Vandivert, he founded Magnum Photos, an international photographic cooperative of select photographers who document world affairs. After Robert Capa's death Seymour became the new president of Magnum and held this post until November 1956, when, traveling on assignment  he was killed by machine-gun fire.",
