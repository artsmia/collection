  "text": "Lumbership Sails Into Dangerous Waters reflects the absolute absurdity and humor of the Funk movement.  David Gilhooly was probably the most involved of Robert Arneson's students at Davis in the movement which rejected the elitism of art.  Since the 1970s, the subject of frogs has consumed his work.  He has developed extensive \"frog worlds\" which document the history, ethnology, religion, and myths of this frog civilization.  His works both parody and demystify human civilization.  In this work, it is the world of beavers that is spoofed as they prepare to devour the wooden ship.",
