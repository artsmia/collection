  "text": "A <I>Vajra</I> (thunderbolt) is a ritual implement used in Esoteric Buddhist ceremonies. Originally a weapon carried by ancient Indian gods, it was adopted into Buddhism as a symbol of the indestructible truth of the Buddha’s teaching. Five-pronged <I>vajras</I> are said to represent the Five Wisdoms of the Five Cosmic Buddhas. This is an unusual example with its prongs positioned closely together and, in fact, attached to the tip of the central prong. This arrangement is said to suggest the nascent enlightened mind.",
