  "text": "Riemerschmid numbers among the most important German designers of the 20th century, the leading figure of the \"functionalist\" wing of the Munich Jugendstil. His candlestick, with its simple diagonal stem set at a 140-degree angle to the base, is remarkable for its modernist forswearing of embellishment, its emphatic assertion of pure line and its ingenious functional design. One curved arm props it upright, the opposite arm serves as a handle.",
