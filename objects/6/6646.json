  "text": "The swollen body of this dish is supported by a tall, narrow foot decorated with thin horizontal lines. Vessels of this type are typical of stoneware produced in Gaya and Silla in southeast Korea, although it is unclear whether they were used in the home or in service to the dead. In the latter case, it would have been used in the ritual presentation of food to the deceased.",
