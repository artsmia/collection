  "text": "Hachiman is a popular god from the Shinto religion. He is a protector of warriors, but he also regularly appears as a Buddhist monk, as he does here. Wearing priestly clothing and with a shaved head, this Shinto god even holds the wish-granting jewel of Buddhism in his left hand. Hachiman was often considered to be a manifestation of the Buddhist bodhisattva Kannon. As early as the 700s, he was called “Hachiman Dai-bosatsu,” or “Hachiman, the Great Bodhisattva.”",
