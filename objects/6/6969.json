  "text": "As was the custom, the best British silver firms chose not to identify their designers as a matter of policy, so the author of this individual dish remains unknown. The firm of Mürrle-Bennet often adopted the curvilinear whiplash elements fresh from the Continent into their line. In this work, the looping handles terminate in a heart shape with a twisting inside-out effect giving equal emphasis to its silhouette and its cut-out spaces.",
