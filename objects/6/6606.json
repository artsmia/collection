  "text": "The legendary phoenix in East Asia is one of the celestial animals of the four directions, associated with the southern quadrant of the heavens. It is said to make earthly appearance only in times of peace and contentment, and thus was only sighted in times of just and able rule. As a result, the phoenix was a symbol of royalty and its use as a decorative motif was restricted to wares intended for use by the imperial family during the first half of the Joseon dynasty.",
