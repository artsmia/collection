With its malachite green stalks and shell white grain, the young barley sways in the breeze, creating a gentle visual rhythm across a ground of silver (now oxidized and darkened). The edge of the field undulates like a beach across the length of screen, giving way to an expanse of gold foil in the upper one-third of the painting.",
