  "text": "Molten ash from the wood fire of the kiln pooled on the surface of this jar, creating a pleasing mottled effect on its shoulders and a pattern of drips along part of its irregular, bulging body. Likely intended for storing sake (rice wine), the jar’s body is asymmetrical—it was meant to be placed on its side. Known as a “recumbent vessel, ” or yokobe, examples can be found throughout the history of Sue ware.",
