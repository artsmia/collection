  "text": "It may look centuries old, as though discovered at an archaeological dig, but this bowl is the work of a modern metalsmith. Marie Zimmermann studied ancient metalwork from around the world and blended the old with the new. She formulated and applied her own patinas (surface treatments), like the rough green finish seen here, to add texture and color. To make this bowl, she carefully hammered a flat sheet of metal into shape and then attached the foot and the delicate handles.",
