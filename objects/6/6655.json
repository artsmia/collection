  "text": "瀬戸 Seto ware, 古瀬戸 Ko-Seto type\r\n\r\nThe shape of this vase, produced at a Seto kiln in the 1200s, is modeled on earlier Chinese examples called “meiping” (literally, “plum vase”), characterized by wide bodies and shoulders with narrow necks. Stoneware pottery decorated with light green or yellow-green ash glazes was first produced at kilns in the Seto area of Owari Province (modern-day Aichi Prefecture) in the 1200s. Early examples of Seto ware, called “Ko-Seto,” echo celadon-glazed porcelains from Song-dynasty China and Goryeo-dynasty Korea.",
