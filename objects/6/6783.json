  "text": "In the 1930s, people gathered around the radio much like we gather around the television today. This radio was designed for stylish hotel lobbies, with its small receivers and speakers hidden behind a futuristic façade. Its round, streamlined shape was—and still is—a modernist departure from the usual boxy radio designs. Its massive size reminds us that the radio was once as much a piece of furniture as a source of news and entertainment.",
