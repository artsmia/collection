  "text": "A traditional bestiary contains descriptions of animals, real and imaginary, along with moralizing allegorical interpretations of their traits and habits. For this modern-day bestiary, Alexander Calder contributed dozens of whimsical line drawings of animals and famous authors as a visual counterpoint to Richard Wilbur’s eclectic selection of excerpts from classic works of literature. Moral lessons are mostly absent.",
