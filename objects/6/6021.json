  "text": "Morrison produced this dynamic geometric abstraction while living and working in New York City and New England. Using elements inspired by nature, Morrison carefully composed a structured arrangement of organic shapes and rectilinear divisions set within an illusionistic, though indeterminate pictorial space. With its emphasis on biomorphism (shapes resembling living organisms) and the Cubist-inspired technique of fragmented forms, the drawing reveals Morrison’s deepening engagement with modernist tendencies in the United States and Europe. In particular, the biomorphic abstractions of the Spanish surrealist Joan Miró (1893-1983) appear to have influenced Morrison’s use of similar imagery here.",
