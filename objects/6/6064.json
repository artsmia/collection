  "text": "In 1930 the young publisher, Albert Skira, asked Matisse to illustrate a special collection of poems by the French Symbolist Stéphane Mallarmé (1842–1898). In this, his first commission to illustrate a book, Matisse established both the comprehensive method of design and the “non-imitative” approach to illustration that he subsequently followed in his other important illustrated books.",
