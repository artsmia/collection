  "text": "In this award-winning artist's book, Maureen Cummings has created a literal as well as figurative crazy quilt fashioned from snippets of text and image representing the personal experiences of women who endured years of abusive confinement in American \"insane asylums\" in the century after the Civil War. These brief observations, presented as hand-written inscriptions and identified by author and dates of confinement, collectively offer a potent critical commentary on the historical plight of women diagnosed with mental illness.",
