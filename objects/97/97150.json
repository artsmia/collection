  "text": "Asante weavers produce luxurious, richly patterned garments that are worn only at formal or ceremonial gatherings such as weddings, funerals, or the enthronement of a chief. These cloths are popularly called 'Kente' (from <I>kenten</I>, basket), a name given to them by 19th century traders that may refer to the basketweave effect of alternating stripe and pattern blocks. Within the Asante culture, however, a cloth such as this would be referred to as <I>Nsaduaso</I>, a cloth of high quality that a man of means might purchase. \r\n\r\nIndividual cloths are given names based on the stripe pattern of the ground cloth. This man's cloth is woven in the <I>nyankonton</I> design, which translates literally as God's eyebrow and symbolizes the beauty and mystery of the rainbow. This exceptional cloth is an example of  <I>adweneasa</I>, a type of kente in which the ground cloth is totally covered with design motifs.",
