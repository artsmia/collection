  "text": "Asante <I>nsaduaso</I> (Kente cloth) are given names related to the specific color and pattern of stripes used in the groundcloth. These names may reference historical events, important chiefs or Queen mothers, natural phenomena, plants or animals. Often, a proverb will be associated with the name, giving the cloth yet another dimension of meaning beyond the purely visual.\r\n\r\nThe green and gold stripes on a maroon background identify this cloth as a variation of the <I>Oyokoman</I> pattern, the oldest and most important cloth pattern of the Asante. It commemorates the civil war between two factions of the royal family in the 18th century; it offers a warning against internal strife and stresses the need for unity and reconciliation. <I>Oyoko</I> is the title of the royal clan, and originally the pattern was reserved for use by the <I>Asantehene</I> (paramount chief) and the royal family.",
