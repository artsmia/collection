  "text": "Unlike the milling shed tableau shown to the right, this model of a grain mill takes full account of human interaction by featuring figures at work as well as a curious dog. In the center is the supervisor in a long robe, instructing a man using a foot-operated mortar and pestle to pound grain. Another worker operates a two-handed winnowing machine while a dog next to him sits focused on a small, open door as if expecting a visitor. A large, circular millstone is positioned in the lower right.",
