  "text": "Activity within traditional Japanese farm families typically centered around a central open hearth (<I>irori</I>). This massive wooden hook (<I>jizaikake</I>) would have been suspended from the beams of a house. Cooking kettles or an iron teapot would have been suspended over the fire by a rope attached to the hook.  This style of <I>jizaikake</I> is popularly referred to as Daikoku, a popular kitchen god, because its cap-like top section suggests Daikoku's hat.",
