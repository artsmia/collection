  "text": "The discovery of gold near the village of Serra Pelada in 1979 unleashed a gold rush that would gather, at the peak of production, 100, 000 miners in the Brazilian Amazon region. Until its closure in 1986, Serra Pelada was the largest open-air gold mine in the world. It was equally famous for its inhumane working conditions and the violence that enveloped the lives of the workers. As a photojournalist with a degree in economics, Salgado is interested in the social condition of labor. His series of photographs about Serra Pelada are part of a major project that documented workers in 26 countries around the world.",
