  "text": "European tourists visiting the Near East capitals of Cairo, Damascus, and Jerusalem vied for souveniers of beautiful inlaid metalwork of the Mamluk era (1250-1570), generating a 19th century revival of the style that lasted until WWI.  This elaborately engraved and silver inlaid oil lamp was crafted by a series of craftsmen using the same techniques as the Mamluks and may have been used as a synagogue lamp.",
