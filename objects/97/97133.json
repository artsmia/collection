  "text": "Du Dazhong, a Ming official, was a noted Suzhou calligrapher and a member of the Wu school group of writers associated with Wang Zhiteng (1535-1612). This calligraphy fan, carefully written in Xiao Kai Shu (small regular script), is an extraordinarily dense prose-poem composed by the Tang poet Yang Jiong (650-ca.694) titled \"Prosepoem While Leaning on the Study Desk.\" The verse recounts the serious rigor of true scholarship. A few lines read thusly:\r\n\r\nScholars have transmitted the classics and are involved in extending knowledge to the utmost...They have exerted themselves in study questing after improvement...How can a scholar sleep in peaceful withdrawal'...Let him emulate the national craftsmen and develop their skill. May he model himself on mountains and forests, taking them as his pattern...\r\n\r\nAbove is the prosepoem \"While Learning on the Study Desk.\" Wanli year Yi You (1558), ninth month at the first appearance of the moon, I was returning by boat from Pingling. We took the route that goes by Xi Qiu. Here I saw the clustered peaks in the misty rain, no less beautiful than a painting. I saw this fine fan lying on my desk, and so roughly brushed this to record my inspiration. But I do feel ashamed that my calligraphy is unskillful.\r\n                                                                                          Du Dazhong",
