  "text": "As indicated by the subject's blue robe adorned with circular shou (longevity) characters, this exquisitely detailed portrait was commissioned to celebrate the birthday of the aristocratic young woman, shown seated at a black-and-gold lacquer table on a garden terrace. She has a fashionable hairstyle and several objects of expensive refinement. On the table near her elbow are a snuff bottle, fan, ruyi (wish granting) scepter, and a porcelain flower vase. At her feet are a blue-and-white jardini√®re, and an unusual tissue container or sewing box, possibly of Western derivation. Both objects are profusely decorated with butterflies, an auspicious motif, whose character (die) is a pun for the word meaning \"age seventy to eighty,\" another way of wishing someone a long, happy life.",
