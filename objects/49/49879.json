  "text": "The legendary Battle of Clavijo, said to have occurred in the mid-800s, was thought to mark the moment when Christian forces drove the Muslims out of Spain. According to the story, one of the twelve apostles of Jesus, James the Greater, who had died 800 years earlier and had been buried in Spain, miraculously appeared and led the Christians to victory over a much larger Muslim army. James can be found on his galloping horse in the middle of the scene. He wears a seashell on his hat, an emblem adopted by countless pilgrims who have traveled to James’s burial place, Santiago de Compostela.",
