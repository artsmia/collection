  "text": "Scantily clad men bathing and socializing was an unusual subject for a print in the 1400s. It may reflect Dürer’s interest in Italian Renaissance anatomical representation. It may also be a paean to homoeroticism. At least some of the men resemble known persons: the chubby beer drinker, Dürer’s humanist pal Willibald Pirckheimer; the foreground men with comb and flower, Nuremberg patricians and future Dürer patrons, brothers Lucas and Stephan Paumgärtner; the man leaning against the pump with the well-placed cock, Dürer himself, and the two musicians, perhaps self-portraits at younger ages. The onlooker in the background mirrors the voyeuristic role that Dürer assigns to those of us looking at this print.",
