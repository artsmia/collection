  "text": "Here we see a jousting tournament that took place on the Wittenberg town square, November 15 and 16, 1508. Elector Frederick the Wise of Saxony staged such courtly festivals for amusement, but they also provided opportunities for elite families to meet and show off their wealth.\r\n\r\nThe combatants and their mounts are heavily armored for competitions involving lances, swords, and batons. Though militarily these staged conflicts were outdated remnants of an earlier age, the collapse of a horse and rider recalls the intensity of battle.",
