  "text": "A table fan is meant to disperse air ina  hot, stagnant room. The fan needs a set of elevated, whirling blades that can be shielded from curious fingers. In his elegant design for a table fan, Ezio Pirali shaped the blades like those of an airplane propeller, lending a sense of adventure to an otherwise mundane item. To further reinforce this idea, he surrounded the fan with a graceful, curvilinear support, which simultaneously suggests the freedom of flight and provides a visual cue to the viewer: what lurks inside the support should not be touched. The VE505 won Pirali two design awards--a Compasso d'Oro and a silver medal at the Milan Triennale in 1954.",
