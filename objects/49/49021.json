  "text": "It’s hard to miss the curving embrace of the forms in this still life, a genre Gág saw as anything but still. When her diaries were made available for the first time in 1987, there were several entries about how her sensual nature fueled her creativity. The strongly contrasting lights and darks reflect Gág’s tendency in the mid-1920s to draw at night, when her only illumination was often the harsh light of a kerosene lamp.",
