  "text": "Albecht Dürer’s Apocalypse had the most spellbinding illustrations of any book published in the 1400s. One of sixteen images, this illustrated the thirteenth chapter of The Book of Revelation:\r\n\r\n… I saw a beast coming out of the sea. It had ten horns and seven heads, with ten crowns on its horns…. Then I saw a second beast, coming out of the earth. It had two horns like a lamb, but it spoke like a dragon. It… made the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast…. And it performed great signs, even causing fire to come down from heaven to the earth in full view of the people…. \r\n\r\nThe seed for this remarkable image was a small woodcut in a Bible published by his godfather, Anton Koberger, when Dürer was twelve years old.",
