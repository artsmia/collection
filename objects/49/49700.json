  "text": "Grateloup was one of the best-known engravers of miniatures in 18th-century France. He developed a secret method of engraving his portraits in which he attempted to have no line, dot, or trace of his technique evident in the finished work. The artist apparently used a mezzotint and aquatint ground and worked over the plates with incredible care using a drypoint needle. He pulled his own prints, and impressions as beautiful as those in the Jones Collection are quite rare.",
