  "text": "British modernist Anthony Caro has played a pivotal role in the development of \r\ntwentieth-century sculpture. Known for his innovative use of assembled industrial \r\nmaterial such as bronze, steel, iron, lead, stone, wood, and paper, he typically produces large-scale abstract sculptures that rest directly on the ground, inviting the viewer to engage directly with them. The molded paper multiple #25 Lavender is one of a series of related small-scale sculptures he produced in collaboration with master printer Ken Tyler at Tyler Graphics. Each sculpture is unique and was formed, painted and varnished by hand.",
