  "text": "American sculptor Mark di Suvero is widely recognized for his powerful large-scale \r\nabstract sculptures made from welded steel beams, metal plates, and scrap industrial materials. Some of the sculptures are stationary; others are designed to be kinetic, incorporating parts that can move freely in space. Di Suvero’s work is grounded in abstract expressionism, conveying emotion through line, color, material, and most importantly, the active engagement of space. Rising (for Walt Whitman) is a small-scale exploration of these ideas, where variable spatial and formal relationships provide a conceptually nuanced work of art that invites close inspection.",
