  "text": "Palombo is best remembered for his monumental architectural sculptures, the doors to the Hall of Remembrance at Yad Vashem and the entrance gates to the Israeli Knesset. This Hanukkah lamp is also sculpture. Rather than using rich materials and decorative stylistic elements, the simple iron surface is blackened, rough. The jagged terminals of the candlesticks look dangerous, and the course welds bind the piece together like rivets on shackles. This work does not seem to rejoice in the Festival of Lights, but subtly reminds us of those lost to the Holocaust.",
