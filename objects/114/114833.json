  "text": "Whoever gave this comb to his wife more than 200 years ago must have loved her dearly. Carefully carved and made of precious materials (elephant ivory and gold folio), itâ€™s something the owner would have shown off, perhaps even wearing it in her hair. It would signal that she was among the wealthy elite of Zanzibar, and had married well.",
