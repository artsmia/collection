  "text": "The American artist Charles Burchfield worked primarily in watercolor, and is a celebrated American modernist landscape painter. Calling himself an inlander, he lived most of his life in the region of northeastern Ohio, western Pennsylvania, and western New York, and his work was influenced by the landscape and nature of the area. In a letter dated May 3, 1963, Burchfield described this work, stating \"A sunny morning in the season when plant life is in its first lush growth-little houses 'peak' out at the beholder from behind a meadow of fresh young oats.\" In this watercolor, Burchfield's broad strokes of color and vivid palette convey his deep love for the American landscape.",
