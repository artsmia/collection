  "text": "Félix Buhot has positioned us in front of the Hôtel Dieu Hospital so that we look toward the cab stand, where carriages patiently await customers. It’s a soggy day: the rigs, passersby, and lampposts are reflected on the wet pavement. Buhot relished atmospheric, moody scenes like this. Buhot experimented constantly, and here he left a translucent layer of ink on the plate and printed on pale green paper to emphasize the damp chill of a gloomy morning.",
