  "text": "A Tyiwara headcrest should be seen in profile to appreciate the sculptor’s visual imagination: the dynamic beauty of the design, the balance of its elements. Like the Greek chimera, the Tyiwara is a composite creature, its features drawn from the antelope, pangolin, and aardvark, a mythical animal that taught humans how to farm. When used in agricultural ceremonies, the crest is mounted on a dancer’s braided hat.",
