  "text": "Born in Paris, Andrew Dasburg became an important member of the American modernist movement. His travels in Europe early in his career and the work of European modern artists he saw there, like Paul Cézanne and Pierre Matisse, profoundly influenced his style. He was also drawn to the American Southwest and in 1918, began living on and off in Taos, New Mexico, where he eventually settled in 1930. It was during this period in the 1930s that he executed this work. The still life reflects Dasburg's interest in geometric shapes and experimentation with color.",
