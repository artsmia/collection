  "text": "Turczan’s photograph of an Orthodox Christian nun gazing out of a window in Lviv, Ukraine, conveys the young woman’s isolation from secular life as well as her solemnity in fulfilling her vows. Turczan’s portrait of Ukrainian children affected by a catastrophe at a nearby nuclear power plant is similarly poignant; wearing grave expressions, the children stand as witnesses to the trauma of the nuclear explosion and its immediate aftermath.",
