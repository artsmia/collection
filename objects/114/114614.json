  "text": "German painter and printmaker Gerhard Richter is a leading contemporary artist whose body of work is distinguished for its eclectic range of styles and innovative creative solutions. Working both in abstraction and photorealism, Richter challenges our ideas of representation and illusionistic space by allowing the processes and materials of art to recast and reinterpret the world around us. His abstract work varies from textured monochromatic paintings to heavily layered gestural works executed by drawing a squeegee across the surface of wet paint. Richter’s 2003 screenprint Eis 2 is a characteristic example of the latter approach, here realized as an editioned print. ",
