  "text": "If this boat and its reflection were smooth and refined, this image would have a very different feel. Much of its impact seems to come from the feeling expressed in the ragged, imperfectly cut lines. For Arts and Crafts proponents, such lines implied authenticity. The influence of Japanese woodblock prints is apparent in the soft, gradated background, the isolated subject, and the narrow, vertical format.",
