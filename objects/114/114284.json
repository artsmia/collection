  "text": "After acquiring this anonymous sheet in 1982, Alfred Moir attributed it to the Genoese painter Giovanni Andrea de' Ferrari, but later changed his mind and thought it might be by his contemporary, Gioacchino Assereto. Recently the Genoese drawings scholar Valentina Frascarolo has suggested de' Ferrari is the more likely hand. She notes a related painting by de' Ferrari in a private collection, and will be publishing her findings shortly.",
