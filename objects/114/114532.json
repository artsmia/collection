  "text": "Alfred Thompson Bricher is considered to be the last of the great Hudson River School landscape painters. He is best known for his coastal views. The present pen and ink drawing shows an entrance to an inlet along a rocky coast. The image is assuredly rendered in pen and ink. One might task if this is actually a sketch from nature, a preliminary compositional drawing, or a record of a completed painting. It is executed in two fairly distinct densities of ink; so, it may be a sketch that was further worked up later and signed with a monogram, perhaps for sale.",
