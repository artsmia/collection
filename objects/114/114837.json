  "text": "The Clare family members were a dynasty of Victorian artists from Birmingham who specialized in still life and flower paintings. Oliver was schooled to an extent by his father, George Clare, as their stippling techniques and subject matter are almost identical. In Birmingham he was commissioned by a local health food firm to paint still-lifes to be reproduced on postcards and posters.",
