  "text": "Prof. Moir attributed this sheet to the Florentine painter Ludovico Cigoli, relating it to a painting by the artist, \"Joseph and Potiphar's Wife\" (Galleria Borghese, Rome), specifically to the alluring hand gesture of Joseph's famous and unsuccessful seducer. The Cigoli scholar Miles Chappell, however, recently suggested the study might be closer to the circle of Francesco Furini, a younger Florentine painter. The painter-priest Furini is well known for his depictions of the female form.",
