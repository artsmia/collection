  "text": "Dazzling, vivid, and outrageous: this carpet is at once a striking display of human creativity and a typical example of a design by the Ait Ouagharda people, a subgroup of the Berber. Made in the arid Anti-Atlas region, these rugs are thin and flat, woven like tapestries instead of knotted like the bulkier rugs made in the colder regions to the north. The tapestry technique provides Ait Ouagharda weavers with significant freedom in design, reflected in this rugâ€™s cacophony of colorful triangles, checks, and stripes.",
