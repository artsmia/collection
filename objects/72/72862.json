  "text": "The Yang shao culture (c. 5000-3000 BCE) located in the middle region of the Yellow River (<I>Huang he</I>) was at its zenith in the fifth millenium BCE. A complex neolithic settlement was discovered at the village of Panbo near Xi'an in Shanxi province which became the namesake to a whole range of ceramic artifacts made in this region. Panbo phase (4800-4300 BCE) pottery is rich in shapes and decorative techniques including painting.\r\n\r\n<P>The beauty of this relatively plain bowl, however, is based on its fine, even potting and well-proportioned profile. Thin walled and perfectly hemispherical in shape, this elegant vessel exemplifies the highest standard of hand-built ceramic production. Evidence from excavation sites around Panbo suggests that large bowls such as this were sometimes used as lids to funerary urns.\r\n",
