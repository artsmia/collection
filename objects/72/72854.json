Redouté's paintings, like those of other botanical artists, were translated into engravings and painstakingly finished by hand. These exquisite prints, most executed by French printmakers, came to the MIA's Department of Prints and Drawings from the collection of Dwight and Helen Minnich, who had a special f",
