  "text": "This beautiful composition shows putti holding a nautilus shell as if it were a precious antique vase, its round shape rhyming with the modest melon and pomegranate beside it. The sheet belongs to a series of four books that were advertised in the Publisher’s Circular of November, 1853, “to afford delight to all who can appreciate the beautiful in Nature.” In Victorian society, shells were objects of enormous aesthetic interest, and viewing them in books was a popular pastime. Jerrard’s volumes, the advertisement further touted as “a truly elegant suite of table books most appropriate for Marriage, Birthday, or Annual Presents. . . .”",
