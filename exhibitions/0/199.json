  "exhibition_title": "Three Centuries of Tradition: The Renaissance of Custom Sporting Arms in America",
  "exhibition_description": "Three Centuries of Tradition featured examples of work by living American gunmakers known for their translations of traditional European, British, and American sporting arms of various styles made between 1640 and 1940. An introductory section featured sporting arms made during that timeframe which served as stylistic and technological guides for contemporary work. Three Centuries of Tradition presented custom-made sporting arms as consummate examples of the decorative arts, demonstrating the highest artistic achievements in carving, inlay, and engraving of metal and wood. Guest curators for the exhibition include gunsmith Mark Silver, and Wallace Gusler, Master Gunsmith at Colonial Williamsburg. A catalogue accompanied the exhibition.",
