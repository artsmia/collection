  "exhibition_description": "This exhibition featured two groups of large-scale works by one of America’s leading contemporary photographers. The culmination of a six-year project photographing the olive orchards and sacred trees of Spoleto, Italy, it revealed JoAnn Verburg’s profound interest in the reciprocity between humans and nature. The exhibition addressed the interrelatedness of life cycles, agriculture, and commerce and the mystery of sacred landscape. The installation reflected a sensitivity to architecture, human scale, and implied and actual time— issues more often addressed by installation art, architecture, or theater than by conventional photography. Verburg saw the olive tree, a life form essential to Italian culture, as a powerful metaphor for exchange. She made a gift of these works in her presentation of living cultural icons that do much to stimulate our own wonder and our own relationships with place and with what is sacred in nature.",
