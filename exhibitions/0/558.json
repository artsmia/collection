  "exhibition_description": "The exhibition featured 120 pieces of contemporary Japanese ceramics collected by Carl A. Weyerhauser in 1972 – 1973 and now housed in the Art Complex Museum, Duxbury, Massachusetts. In amassing the collection, every attempt was made to gather from different geographical areas in Japan, each representing a historic legacy of ceramic production. In addition to already recognized master potters — some designated Living National Treasures— remarkable works by emerging artists were also collected. The exhibition reflects the monolithic influence of the tea ceremony on Japanese ceramic production with the majority of the selected works, in form and technique, related to traditional tea wares.",
