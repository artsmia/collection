  "exhibition_description": "Drawn entirely from the permanent collection of The Minneapolis Institute of Arts, this selection of 24 etchings, lithographs, and drawings by the American artist Joseph Pennell (1857-1926) highlighted his ability to create a highly personal communication with his subject. Whether a view of skyscrapers in New York, London’s famous sites, the construction of the Panama Canal, or a far off view of a cathedral in the French countryside, you know that “Pennell was there”—and perhaps recall when you were.\r\nA complex, opinionated intellectual and a leader in the Golden Age of American illustration, Pennell wrote many books on art, artists and his travels. His work was his supreme interest and amusement in life, and these examples of his graphic art showed us the legacy of an important artist.",
