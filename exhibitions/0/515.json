  "exhibition_title": "Marcel Breuer in Minnesota",
  "exhibition_description": "Hungarian-born Marcel Breuer (1902-1981) developed his tubular steel cantilevered chair, one of his many innovative furniture designs, while at the Bauhaus design school in Germany in the 1920s. After immigrating to the United States in 1937, he practiced architecture with Walter Gropius for a decade before opening his own successful office. His buildings, including the Whitney Museum in New York and Unesco Headquarters in Paris, are as visually arresting as his furniture, and he is regarded as one of the most important modern architect/designers of the twentieth century. “Marcel Breuer in Minnesota” is organized by the Minneapolis Institute of Arts to mark the centenary of Breuer’s birth. This exhibition will feature his Minnesota projects, including the Abbey Church and campus at St. John’s University in Collegeville, and two house projects, as well as his furniture designs from the Institute’s collection.",
