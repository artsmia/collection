  "exhibition_title": "A Japanese Legacy: Four Generations of Yoshida Family Artists",
  "exhibition_description": "This exhibition features oil paintings, watercolors and woodblock prints by nine artists from a single Japanese family spanning, four generations and over 100 years. The exhibition addresses the evolution of the popular Japanese print from the late 1800s to present; the adaptation of western styles—naturalism and abstraction—into Japanese styles, methods and aesthetics; and, the dynamics of the family tradition in its commercial, stylistic, and interpersonal dimensions. The Yoshida family is fascinating because of the longevity and breadth of the family’s artistic legacy, its high aesthetic standards, and its internationalism. Thus, this exhibition allows for multiple foci, including aesthetics, production, culture, politics, and personalities.",
