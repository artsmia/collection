  "exhibition_title": "Everyday Beauty: Guatemalan Huipils",
  "exhibition_description": "Traditionally people throughout the world mark special occasions such as festivals, weddings and religious holidays by wearing elaborate clothing, often made of costly materials. Guatemalan women are particularly noted for their elaborate, handwoven brocade fabrics. In addition to their traditional ceremonial clothing, however, native women frequently celebrate the beauty of cloth every day by wearing brightly patterned woven or embroidered blouses called huipils. Drawing on recent acquisitions to the museum's extensive holding of Guatemalan textiles, this small exhibition celebrated the creative diversity of eight different villages and their distinctive response to the inherent potential of beauty in everyday life.",
