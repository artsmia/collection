  "exhibition_description": "The focus of the exhibition are the great American landscape painters of the mid-19th century, concentrating on the Hudson River School and their contemporaries, who first gave complete visual expression to the idea of America as a vast new world. They took to a logical conclusion many of the ideas about landscape that had preoccupied European artists in the 18th and 19th centuries, while retaining the special character of the country they were exploring: magnificent, dramatic and subtle, by turns. The exhibition will include approximately 80 oil paintings featuring works by Bierstadt, Church, Cole, and Cropsey, among others.",
