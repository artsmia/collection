  "exhibition_description": "“Above is Below” features the spiritually based art of Sarah Chokyi Anne Bauer and David Hamlow. Whose distinct bodies of work have evolved out of long-term meticulously defined daily practice. The exhibition will present an installation of repetitive images by Bauer, who holds sacred Buddhist ritual at the core of her artistic inquiry; and a structure built by Hamlow, who records his daily life by saving, sorting and arranging the commercial packaging and detritus of his daily consumption.",
