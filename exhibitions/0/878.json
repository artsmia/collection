  "exhibition_description": "Ta-coumba Aiken’s public artworks appear in many places around the Twin Cities—the new Central Library, the Minneapolis skyways and St. Paul parking ramps. Known for involving the communities he works in, he will continue in that vein for his upcoming MAEP show. Aiken will show new work, including one large “mosaic” which will allow visitors to assemble and arrange painted squares into new compositions. ",
