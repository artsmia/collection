  "exhibition_description": "Since 1951, the MIA has decorated its American and European period rooms each year to show winter holidays as they were celebrated in times past. Nine period rooms showcase a range of special occasions, from a feast in Tudor England to a 1770s Hanukkah celebration in Providence, Rhode Island. Examples of early Christmas trees and Nativity scenes are highlighted in the Bell Family Decorative Arts Court and the Mary C. and Walter C. Briggs Gallery. To further explore Hanukkah this year, a display of contemporary Hanukkah lamps will be on display near the Providence Room.\r\n\r\nAs well, the MIA’s Prairie-School style Purcell-Cutts House, designed in 1913 by William Gray Purcell and George Grant Elmslie for Purcell and his family, is decorated for the holidays to reflect the upper-middle-class, “progressive” lifestyle of the Purcells around 1915.
