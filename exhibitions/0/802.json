  "exhibition_description": "As the world responds with both moral and financial support for the victims of hurricanes Katrina and Rita, The Minneapolis Institute of Arts also honors the wonderfully diverse communities of the Gulf Coast working to rebuild their lives. Drawn from the museum’s permanent collection, Southern Exposure celebrates the rich cultural and artistic fabric that has defined New Orleans and the Gulf Coast for over 200 years and has created an essential, enduring place in the heart of the nation. \r\nThis exhibition, including ceramics and paintings, will open at Orchestra Hall on October 14th as part of “Art Spirit: A Benefit for Hurricane Relief,” which takes place on October 16th. Photographs and works on paper from the MIA’s permanent collection will augment Southern Exposure when it opens in the General Mills Welcome Gallery on October 18, 2005. ",
