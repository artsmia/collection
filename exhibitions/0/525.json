  "exhibition_title": "Light Bound: Photographers Regard the Book",
  "exhibition_description": "This exhibition includes the work of seven contemporary artists who have extensively photographed books. Working over the last ten years, as electronic publishing emerged, these photographers celebrated the traditional book, made of ink, paper, and glue. Their works show books as purveyors of popular culture, objects of physical beauty, vessels of information, and symbols of human knowledge. The exhibition consists of about 60 photographs and one installation by: Sally Alatalo, Peter Beard, James Henkel, Doug Keyes, Abelaredo Morell, Alison Rossiter, and JoAnn Verburg.",
