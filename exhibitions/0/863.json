  "exhibition_description": "Over 100 works of art from the collection of John C. Weber, spanning major aesthetic trends in Japanese art from the 12th to 20th centuries. The Weber Collection has quickly become one of the most important private collections of Japanese art in the United States. The exhibition will include hanging scrolls, folding screens, ceramics, lacquerware and textiles. While individual objects have been exhibited at the Japan Society in New York and at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the collection as a whole has not been presented publicly before. An international team of scholars has been enlisted to write the catalogue. A fully illustrated exhibition catalogue accompanies this exhibition.",
