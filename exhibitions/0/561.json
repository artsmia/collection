  "exhibition_description": "Walker Evans’s crisp, authoritative images helped define the documentary style of photography that flourished between the World Wars. Working for the U.S. government in the 1930s, Evans created his most significant body of work, essaying the vernacular architecture and rural poor of the Deep South. This exhibition consisted of about fifty of these stunning, vintage photographs. They were drawn entirely from the Institute’s permanent collection, which has one of the country’s most significant holdings of Evans’s work. A catalogue accompanied the exhibition.",
