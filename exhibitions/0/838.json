  "exhibition_description": "Painted rawhide containers, known as parfleche, were traditionally made and used by tribes of the Plains region to store and transport food and possessions. They are adorned with a variety of complex abstract designs, which were passed down through generations among women. Containers provided a means for creative, spiritual, and intellectual expression while preserving the traditions of their ancestors.\r\nThis mini-exhibition explores how the various functions of these containers dictated their size, form, and designs, as well as how they represented cultural wealth and ways of life. Containers from different tribes that reveal the similarities, diversity, and beauty of these functional and important objects will be presented. ",
