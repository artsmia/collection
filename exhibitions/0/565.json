  "exhibition_title": "Werner Bischof: Life and Work of a Photographer 1916 - 1954",
  "exhibition_description": "Born in Zürich, Switzerland 26 April 1916, Werner Bischof began his career in studio photography. Following service in the Swiss army, he documented Europe in the aftermath of World War II. The devastation he recorded there was to influence his work for the rest of his life. He joined the Magnum Photographic agency in 1949 and continued to focus on the ‘face of human suffering’. One of his most well known photo-essays on ‘Famine in India’ was published in Life magazine the same year. He also completed assignments in Korea, Okinawa and Japan. He covered the stories of refugees from Mao’s China and the war in Indochina. Werner Bischof died in May 1954 at the age of 38 while on assignment for Magnum and Life in Peru. This exhibition included more than 65 prints covering the Studio Period, Europe After the War and Traveling the World.",
