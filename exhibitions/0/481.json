  "exhibition_description": "Using Jack Lenor Larsen fabrics, the exhibition looked at high-end textile manufacturing in the last half of the 20th-century, emphasizing its international character and close association to contemporary aesthetic preferences of western culture. The focus centered on creative design and production, bringing attention to a variety of issues which affected the end product, including cottage production to high tech manufacturing, the availability of materials, tariff restrictions, trade wars, among others. The Jack Lenor Larsen archive was formally given to the museum and the University of Minnesota in 1999.",
