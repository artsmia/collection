  "exhibition_description": "This exhibition featured large-scale “romantic minimalist” paintings by German-born artist Barbara Kreft, who has made the Upper Midwest her home for nearly two decades. This region’s diverse landscape - its wide horizons and high arctic sky - has profoundly influenced her work. Well known for her elegantly evocative paintings of magical plant-filled environments, Kreft had depicted mysterious light-filled spaces containing pods, seeds, and various floating organic forms that seem to reflect psychological states of being. Her recent paintings speak to the luminous beauty of the earth. They present natural phenomena and life pattern in simpler spaces that suggest constellations of various sorts. The atmospheric and reductive quality of these large canvases heightened their contemplative effect and encouraged the viewer to linger in the artist’s ethereal landscape.",
