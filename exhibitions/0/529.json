  "exhibition_description": "Eternal Egypt: Masterworks of Ancient Art from the British Museum is the first major Egyptian exhibition to be drawn solely from the British Museum’s outstanding collection of Egyptian antiquities. Both renowned masterpieces and little-known treasures provide an overview of the richness and scope of this premiere collection of Egyptian art. The exhibition consists of 144 objects and spans the full range of pharaonic history, from shortly before the First Dynasty, about 3100 BC, to the Roman occupation of the fourth century AD. The four periods into which ancient Egyptian history is divided – the Old Kingdom, the Middle Kingdom, the New Kingdom, and the Late Period –form the underlying structure of the exhibition. A fully illustrated catalogue accompanies the exhibition. The catalogue is supported in part by Helen H. Scheidt.",
