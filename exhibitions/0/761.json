  "exhibition_description": "Debuting in this new 3rd-floor gallery are modernist paperworks selected from the 140 pieces generously donated to the Institute as part of the Norwest Modernism Collection in 1998. The initial installation will range from Alphonse Maria Mucha’s exquisite suite of lithographs, “The Four Flowers,” (1897) to Dadaist exercises in impudent typography. \r\nWorks drawn from the remainder of this collection — 350 objects in various media (metalwork, glassware, ceramics and wood — are installed in two companion galleries. \r\nThe new gallery is devoted to modernist works on paper ranging from architectural renderings, design sketches, wallpapers, photo-montage, collage, graphic design, posters, portfolios to illustrated books. Its purpose is to provide a forum for examining the dramatic convergence of diverse media in the 20th century. It is also intended to complement Papermade Modernism, an examination of paper as sculptural form on view at Wells Fargo Center through September 2006.",
