  "exhibition_description": "Alfred Moir, a retired art history professor and native Minnesotan, assembled an impressive private collection of mainly old master Italian drawings. There were also several French, Dutch and Spanish works and 19th-century drawings. His research over the years has yielded new attributions and expands our knowledge of artists working in the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries. The exhibition was comprised of 75 drawings that included: black and colored chalks; pen and ink; brush and ink work and watercolor.",
