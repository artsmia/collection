  "exhibition_title": "Anastylosis: Drawings by Mary Griep",
  "exhibition_description": "For the last six years Mary Griep has been working on a series of large scales drawings of sacred spaces of the 11th and 12th century. Eleventh century buildings have been through centuries of care, neglect damage and restoration. Griep uses her drawings, some over 30 feet long, to try to understand and express the underlying nature of the sites. She searches for an understanding of the correspondences and the differences that go deeper than the surface details and express visually the worldview and tradition of the builders. The act of drawing is meditative; it mimics the role of these buildings as a way of concentrating attention.",
