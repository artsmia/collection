  "exhibition_title": "Maya Dreams: Textile Traditions of Guatemala",
  "exhibition_description": "Brilliantly colorful and richly patterned, Guatemalan textiles are a living expression of an ancient Maya tradition. Artisans from the sixty major weaving centers in the highlands of Guatemala create distinctive regional identities using specific colors, layouts and design motifs. Imagery, from fanciful birds and mythological animals to abstract representations of natural and celestial phenomena, covers the surface of many cloths, interpreted in intricate brocades or dense embroideries.\r\nDrawn from the permanent collection, this exhibition celebrates the aesthetic vision and generosity of Dr. Richard Simmons.
