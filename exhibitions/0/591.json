  "exhibition_description": "This exhibition consists of 60 subtle landscape photographs dating 1890-1910, drawn entirely from the Institute's permanent collection. Post (1857-1921) was one of the first photographers to make creative images with the camera, associating with Alfred Stieglitz and presenting his pictures in the leading photographic periodical, Camera Work. Post excelled at picturing the snow, water lilies, and apple trees of Maine, rendering them in softly-focused and understated platinum prints. This exhibition rediscovers an underappreciated master, will be accompanied by a catalog, and will travel to other American museums.\r\nExhibition tour:\r\nThe Minneapolis Institute of Arts, September 10, 2005 – January 22, 2006\r\nCedar Rapids Museum of Art, February 17 - May 21, 2006\r\nPortland Museum of Art, June 3 - Aug. 27, 2006\r\nColumbus Museum of Art, September 16, 2006 – January 14, 2007\r\nBrigham Young University Museum of Art, February 3 - June 4, 2007\r\nTacoma Art Museum, June 23 – September 16, 2007",
