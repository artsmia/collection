  "exhibition_description": "An exhibition of paintings, prints, mixed media and installation work by Ruthann Godollei, Alexa Horochowski, Lee Anne Swanson and Carolyn Swiszcz, four artists known for material innovation and narrative irony. Ruthann Godollei decoded patterns of family and social dysfunction in sparse, scratchboard drawings and monoprints depicting text and simple domestic objects. Alexa Horochowski scrutinized that behemoth institution known as marriage in a multi-sensory laundry room equipped with bubbles, a working ringer washer, and clothes line installed with embroidered underwear. Lee Anne Swanson combined hi-tech materials and lo-tech ideas in an installation that accessorized a huge, moody painting with a line of waist-high livestock tanks containing splashing glitter-covered mechanical duck decoys. Carolyn Swiszcz revealed her love for accidental gesture and material flexibility in a giant eraser board mandala.",
