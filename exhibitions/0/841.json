  "exhibition_description": "This exhibition highlights the work of Shibata Zeshin (1807–91). Trained as a boy in the art of gold-flecked lacquerware, he gained a reputation as a master lacquer artist by reviving techniques long forgotten, and by advancing the field by integrating many new materials into his designs. He first studied painting to improve the decorations he applied to his lacquerware, but he soon became so adept the paintings themselves won high praise. Trained in the naturalistic manner of the Shijo School, Zeshin rejected the slippily executed and formulaic designs of his colleagues and fought to maintain the quality of traditional Japanese craftsmanship. His crowning achievement was to invent a technique that allowed him to paint with lacquer on paper and silk. This installation is the first to examine Zeshin’s work by looking at his dual role as a cultural preservationist and technical innovator. A fully illustrated exhibition catalogue accompanies \r\nthis exhibition. ",
