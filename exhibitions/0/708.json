  "exhibition_description": "The cocktail-like jazz and the skyscraper-is an American invention. Capitalizing on the cocktail rage of the 1920s and `30s, a number of enterprising companies (American and European), produced an amazing array of barware including cocktail shakers, syphon bottles, trays, decanters, ice buckets and accompanying accessories. The exhibition focuses on modernist works produced by such major-league designers as: Normel Bel Geddes, Russel Wright, Lurelle Guild, Jean Puiforcat, among others.",
