  "exhibition_description": "For modesty's sake, women throughout much of the Indian subcontinent traditionally have covered their head and shoulders with a shawl or veil. In public, the feminine ideal was fully clad and quiet. But the veils themselves were another matter. They told stories.\r\nThrough pattern and color, material and workmanship, a veil spoke of geographic origin, tribal affiliation, economic standing, and marital status. It told the season and social occasion. It could provide talismanic protection. And sometimes, when fashioned for her own use by a woman of a certain skill and temperament, a veil turned community tradition into an expression of personal whimsy. Always a flag of identity, these pieces of cloth revealed as much as they concealed.\r\nRepresenting almost a century of collecting, \"Veiled Communications\" assembles two-dozen superb head coverings from India and Pakistan that broadly reflect the region's diverse textile traditions of dyeing, embroidering, printing, and weaving.",
