  "exhibition_description": "This inaugural installation in the Institute’s new wing will feature seminal pieces by nationally known artists whose work was discovered and fostered by regional collectors following the Second World War. The two galleries devoted to changing craft installations will include innovative and influential early work by now-established American artists such as Robert Stocksdale, Peter Voulkos, and Beatrice Wood, working in various media (ceramics, metalwork, wood and jewelry). This early nurturing of studio craft in the Twin Cities will be illustrated through objects from the Institute’s collection.",
