  "exhibition_description": "Minneapolis artist Alyn Silberstein presents Top Mix, an audacious and eye-popping installation of large-scale digital prints. Using sophisticated computer hardware, software, and printing technologies, Silberstein samples and manipulates digital photos to create lush abstract images that are rich in color, texture, and pattern. It is ultramodern image-making fused with ancient and traditional motifs. These stunning prints are installed on walls decorated with floor-to-ceiling murals to create a truly mind-bending visual experience.",
