  "exhibition_description": "Bridging America with Frank Lloyd Wright celebrates the opening of the Marshall Field’s Bridge in Minneapolis, inspired by the work of Frank Lloyd Wright and designed by his successor firm, Taliesin Architects. The bridge, spanning Interstate 94 at Third Avenue South, forges a new connection between downtown Minneapolis, the Minneapolis Convention Center, and The Minneapolis Institute of Arts. To provide a context for the Marshall Field’s Bridge, the exhibition also examines over a dozen of Frank Lloyd Wright’s bridge projects through photo reproductions, models, and video. Produced over a sixty-year period, Wright’s designs range from simple footbridges in rural settings to multi-level, long-span urban bridges for both vehicles and pedestrians.",
