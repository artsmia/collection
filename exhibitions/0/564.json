  "exhibition_description": "The 205-year-old portrait of George Washington is considered an American treasure compared to that of the Liberty Bell and the Declaration of Independence. It is commonly called the “Lansdowne” portrait, the title derived from the name of the person for whom it was painted, the Marquis of Lansdowne. Senator William Bingham commissioned it in 1796 for the marquis, a British support of the American cause during the American Revolution. The artist is Gilbert Stuart, the preeminent portraitist in the United States in the early 19th century. Stuart painted nearly 1,000 portraits in his lifetime including Paul Revere, Abigail Adams, Mohawk Chief Joseph Brandt as well as George Washington and numerous other U.S. presidents. In spring of 2001 the National Portrait Gallery acquired the “Lansdowne” portrait through a generous gift from the Donald W. Reynolds Foundation.",
