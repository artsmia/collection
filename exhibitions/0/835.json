  "exhibition_description": "Peter Voulkos (1924-2002) is considered the most revolutionary American ceramic artist of the twentieth century. A defining figure in the American craft movement after the Second World War, his early work shows expertise on the wheel as well as a definite Asian influence. By the late 1950s, fueled by contact with Abstract Expressionist artists, Voulkos began creating abstract ceramic sculpture, characterized by a muscular, freeform technique.",
