  "exhibition_description": "The artists Jacob Lawrence and Gwendolyn Knight met while working in Harlem in the 1930s; their friendship led to marriage in 1941, and their long relationship has been a vital factor in both artist’s work. Jacob Lawrence’s series on Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman of 1938-40 told the story of these African-American heroes in over 60 sequential panels. While Jacob’s paintings told a story and relate to his cultural history, Gwendolyn’s paintings and prints were more personal and represent the people and experiences which have filled her life.",
