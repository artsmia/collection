  "exhibition_description": "This exhibition presents new and recent work by Daniel Kaniess and Yang Yang, featuring intensely gestural, re-cycled mixed-media works by Kaniess and figurative paintings and drawings by Yang Yang, including oversized new works by both artists.\r\nAs a painter and creator of mixed media works Kaniess’ goal is to make us aware the way in which we take in information today has changed the way that we see. His kinesthetic “drawings” or “paintings” animate the picture plane and allude to myriad inspirations – graffiti, digital technology, contemporary graphic design, and computer animation. Kaniess brings all – over abstraction squarely into the 21st century through images that he draws and paints on used record albums and expanses of billboard vinyl. His double-logic turns graffiti into ”windows” reading of his surfaces, and re-connects our aesthetic consciousness.",
