  "exhibition_description": "This exhibition of forty caricature prints and drawings from the MIA’s permanent collection presents social satire that both bristles and entertains. It examines the comic art form in eighteenth-century England, in the work of some of the period’s most celebrated caricaturists-William Hogarth (1697-1764), Thomas Rowlandson (1756-1827), and James Gillray (1756-1815).
