  "exhibition_description": "The Saint John’s Bible exhibition consists of 60 of the more than 200 Bible pages that are being created for the first handwritten, illuminated Bible from the modern era. Scribes in a Wales scriptorium under the artistic direction of Donald Jackson, one of the world’s foremost calligraphers and the Scribe to Queen Elizabeth are creating the Bible. The Bible incorporates many of the characteristics of its medieval predecessors: it is be written on vellum, using quills, natural handmade inks, hand-ground pigments, and gild, such as gold leaf. It, however, employs a modern English translation as well as contemporary scripts and illumination. ",
