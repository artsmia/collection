Now an America citizen, Scully was born in Ireland and has made prints in professional workshops in New York, Munich, Barcelona, and Tampere, Finland. His magnificent compositions resonate with personal reactions to the world around him. The Prints of Sean Scully includes etchings, aquatints, and woodcuts from the past twenty years, as well as lithographs he has recently begun to make. The Smithsonian American Art Museum is the only institution in the U.S. to own a master set of prints.
