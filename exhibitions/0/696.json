  "exhibition_title": "Fabulous Photographic Ephemera",
  "exhibition_description": "Millions of ephemeral items related to find and applied photography are produced each year. The items are usually time sensitive, small in size, and rarely saved. They include posters, letters, labels, brochures, and other items primarily made of paper. They can provide valuable bits of historic information, such as prices or exhibition dates. In addition, they sometimes yield personal information about photographers, humanizing them or showcasing their opinions. This exhibition includes about 100 objects of photographic ephemera from the files and collection of the Department of Photographs at The Minneapolis Institute of Arts. The material includes objects relating to Ansel Adams, Diane Arbus, Richard Avedon, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Edward S. Curtis, and many other major photographers.",
