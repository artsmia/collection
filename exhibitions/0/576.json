  "exhibition_description": "Beauford Delaney, an African-American, was an artist who produced works of great diversity and technical complexity who has, unfortunately, remained relatively unknown to the general public. While his pursuit of art began in his native Knoxville, Tennessee, and continued over a five-year period in Boston, the years that followed (1929-1979) were the most innovative and productive of the artist’s life. His career is generally broken into two parts: the New York Years (1929-1953), during which time Delaney produced his colorful and highly-engaging compositions of the City’s urban landscape; and the Paris years (1953-1979) when the artist, known as “the dean of American Negro painters” in Paris, embraced abstract expressionism in a study of color and light. The Institute’s presentation, for the first time, provides a survey of the progression of his work. The exhibition brings forth transitional works that have not previously been considered and illuminate his place within American art history. The exhibition consists of approximately forty paintings and ten works on paper borrowed from institutional and private collections in America and Europe.",
