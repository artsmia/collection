  "exhibition_description": "Artists Laura Stack and Anne Sugnet come to the abundance of the natural world - to its ever-shifting patterns of replication - with great reverence. Both artists have experienced profound events with the physical body and consider making art to be a transcendent action. Through their work they seek to create an antidote to a high speed, high-tech world that operates beyond human pace. Their exhibition \"High Touch\", which features Stack's luminous black and white drawings and Sugnet's intimate mixed-media installations, offers a poetic investigation into the very essence of things. Here we find slow amassed time, things becoming and unbecoming, traces of touch, and tender constellations of forms. In both bodies of work, primordial forms emerge - forms that suggest seeds, cones, spirals, cells dividing, or the cosmos. These shapes are familiar and there is comfort in that re-cognition. Yet they are located in mysterious spaces and for that they do not feel didactic but more like déjà vu - that fleeting sense of knowing, shrouded in mystery. It seems that you've been here before - perhaps in another life, perhaps as a cell or a star.",
