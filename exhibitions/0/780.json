  "exhibition_description": "In her large-scale paintings, Alexa Horochowski exploits the bright colors and line quality of childrenâ€™s fables, fairy tales and coloring books to create distilled moments that are provocative and ambiguous. As of trying to be children one last time, young, adolescent girls swing from trees, take rides in rickety boats and fearlessly test the boundaries of their last Indian Summer. The spectacle of their enthusiasm is designed to seduce he viewer while reflecting back the illusion inherent in the adult recalling of childhood. Idyllic landscapes offer a vision of a Shangri-la that never was or could be.",
