  "exhibition_description": "This exhibition brings together a selection of industrial designs dating roughly from 1900 to 1950 (all the result of collaborative efforts, in some instances the individual designer’s identity remains unknown). The selection is purposely devoted to “industrial strength” designs that challenge long-standing concepts of beauty and taste. These designers and manufacturers were attempting to free themselves of applied decoration – function being the driving force. Such advanced ideas as engineering, utility, aerodynamics, styling, streamlining and the exploration of new techniques and materials were shared concerns.",
