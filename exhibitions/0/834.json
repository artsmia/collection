  "exhibition_title": "New Skins: New Paintings by Andrea Carlson and Jim Denomie",
  "exhibition_description": "This exhibition will feature the work of two artists working from the narratives of their Anishinaabe ancestry and worldviews. Jim Denomie and Andrea Carlson demonstrate two different perspectives on their shared content of irony, story and politics.\r\nThe exhibition will include an expansion of Denomie’s ''Renegade'' series. Denomie plans to revisit these politically charged and humorous landscapes in order to show further developments in the renegade’s ongoing saga. These paintings will be shown alongside an installation of portraiture from his painting-a-day series. By painting a daily portrait from his imagination, Denomie addresses the self-analytical qualities of painting others. These intense images complement Denomie’s Renegades by telling a different type of story that reads more like a personal diary.\r\nCarlson’s ''Windigo'' and ''Aatisokaanag'' series will also be featured. In her ''Windigo'' series, Calson questions calcified views of authenticity and cultural purity through hybridized imagery. She is also interested in how stories are often ascribed to objects and how these objects become surrogates for cultural exchange. In the ''Aatisokaanag'' series, Carlson has painted her interpretations of the sacred stories. Each image in this series serves as a cross-section of a larger cycle of stories.",
