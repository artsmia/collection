  "exhibition_description": "Beyond the Maker’s Mark celebrates the extraordinary work of London’s leading eighteenth-century silversmith, Paul de Lamerie (1688-1751). Through the private collection of Mr. and Mrs. Paul Cahn—which includes some of the most important pieces of de Lamerie silver in private hands—the exhibition explores several aspects of de Lamerie’s career, revealing the evolution of his style and the complex organization of his enterprise.\r\nThe exhibition, organized by the Memphis Brooks Museum of Art, features nearly one hundred individual examples of Rococo English silver by de Lamerie and his contemporaries, such as the superb Maynard Dish (1736) and the extraordinary Tureen in the Shape of a Green Turtle (1750). This venue will include several Paul de Lamerie pieces from the MIA collection, including the magnificent Wine Cistern (1719-20). A fully illustrated catalogue accompanies the exhibition.",
