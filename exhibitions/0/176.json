  "exhibition_description": "This exhibition featured potter Richard Bresnahan and the remarkable results obtained from the first firing of a new wood-burning kiln on the campus of St. John's University, St. Cloud, Minnesota. Bresnahan, who apprenticed with the Japanese Nakazato family of potters, well known for his skillfully thrown, uniquely-glazed ceramics and for his commitment to the environment -- used materials indigenous to Minnesota and stoked his kiln with waste wood gathered from the forests surrounding St. John's. The successful firing of the enormous 1,200 cubic feet, three-chamber kiln marked a high point in Bresnahan's artistic career. In addition to the subtle hues of natural ash glazes, the final chamber of the kiln also yielded unglazed ceramics with flash marks of bright reds and oranges, and contrasting soft tans and browns. This exhibition included 50-60 of these objects, and included large-scale storage jars, vases, platters, and teabowls.",
