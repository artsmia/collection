  "exhibition_description": "This exhibition will highlight the artistic output of the Asmat, a native people of western New Guinea. Its theme is the distinct and powerful aesthetic sense of this group, and its expression in a number of art forms, especially sculpture, fiber arts and decorative painting. Asmat art is very distinctive, frequently employing abstract, curvilinear designs in exhilarating combinations. These designs are highlighted by a strong palette, consisting of just three colors; red, white and black. Figural sculpture is often adorned with color as well. The exhibition will consist of objects made by Asmat artists, primarily from the collection of the American Museum of Asmat Art at the University of St. Thomas. Wood sculpture and fiber arts will comprise the majority of the exhibit. A fully illustrated catalogue accompanies the exhibition.",
