  "exhibition_description": "An Acre of Art reflected the focused engagement of artists Mark Knierim and Robert Lawrence with one acre of rural land which they will visit, research and experience for one year. Their process/performance culminated in an exhibition held in three locations: MAEPâ€™s gallery at The Minneapolis Institute of Arts; the World Wide Web; and on the land itself. An Acre of Art extended the work of Knierim and Lawrence, both of whom are known for sculpture and site specific installations that deal with the cultural and physical aspects of place.",
