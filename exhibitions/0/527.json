  "exhibition_description": "Three-Way Vision features new and recent bodies of work by artists Mary Carroll, Clea Felien, and Todd Severson who share notable technical mastery and who engage in what might be called a very obsessive aesthetic and process. The exhibition presents a wild assortment of work ranging from Carroll’s outrageously decorated ceramic vessels; to Felien’s familial portraits, drawn with her left hand and painted with her right; and Severson’s mammoth “collection” of chain saw portraits. “Three-Way Vision” reveals the complex assortment of issues that, for many artists living today, surround ideas about craft, facility, or documentation of culture.",
