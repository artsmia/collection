  "exhibition_description": "This exhibition presents new and recent work by Daniel Kaniess and Yang Yang, featuring intensely gestural, re-cycled mixed-media works by Kaniess and figurative paintings and drawings by Yang Yang, including oversized new works by both artists.\r\nYang Yang’s unique approach to image making integrates calligraphic and pictorial traditions from the East and the West. Classically trained in Chinese ink painting, Yang’s earliest influences include the mythology and philosophy of his homeland China; and later, the visions of modern western masters such as Picasso and Marini. Yang’s figurative images express the wholeness of his experience with nature, creating mystical atmospheres and places “where the viewer has never been before.” Very Taoist in their sensibility, Yang’s paintings are occupied with mysterious animals and humans, who defy any singular narrative. Yang suggests that animals see us far better than we see ourselves, and considers their wisdom (and our blindness to it) to be very significa.nt things",
