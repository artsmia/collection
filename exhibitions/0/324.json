  "exhibition_description": "Highlighted in the exhibition were 136 works of the textile artist and colorist, Kaffe Fassett. The exhibition was based on a retrospective held at the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. Included were works ranging from the first piece knitted by the artist to needlepoint carpets, site installations and wall hangings. The intricate patterns and lush colors of his knitted and needlework pieces illustrated Mr. Fassettâ€™s use of nature and decorative objects for his design inspiration.",
