  "exhibition_description": "R.P.M. presents new work by Mollie Rabiner, J.J. Peet, and Don Myhre: interactive sculpture, fake (but possibly plausible) products and theatrical props “scented” with humor. Yet all three broker serious ideas that, due to their cultural (or counter-cultural) underpinnings, can seem cautionary, subversive or even sinister. \r\nMollie Rabiner invites the gallery visitor to try their luck with relationships and candy-coated desires by playing her stage-set, coin operated, carnival claw and digger machine. J.J. Peet presents a curious array of fake objects designed to carry extreme value or that allude to some secret information or event. He questions the very nature of art through an assortment of found and handmade props -- bags of money; bricks of gold; a count-down-clock; and a mysterious brief case. Don Myhre presents a weird robotic amalgamation in his interactive sculpture, “Raft”. In it he combines a fiberglass jet ski, a downloaded landscape cast in foam, and a tattered taxidermied jackrabbit to create a whacked-out reference to the madness of American comodification.",
