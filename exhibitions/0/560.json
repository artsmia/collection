  "exhibition_title": "Up the Nile: Egypt in 19th Century Photographs",
  "exhibition_description": "This exhibition features early photographic images made along the north-flowing Nile River, from Nubia to Lower Egypt. They meticulously depict the country’s renowned ancient monuments at such sites as Philae, Luxor, Karnak, and Giza. Dating from the late-nineteenth century, the photographs were made by professional photographers for tourists who flocked to Egypt on their “Grande Tour.” The exhibition consists of about fifty albumen prints by a half dozen photographers, including Felice Beato, Felix Bonfils, and Francis Frith. The work is drawn entirely from the Institute’s permanent collection and compliments the concurrent exhibition “Eternal Egypt.”",
