  "exhibition_description": "At a time when most colonies exported natural resources and agricultural products in exchange for English goods, Boston’s economy relied heavily on its manufacturing base. By streamlining production and adapting to the latest fashions, Boston craftsmen produced desirable goods that were less expensive than their English counterparts. Until the mid 18th century, Boston exported more chairs to the American colonies than New York, Philadelphia, or even England. So prevalent were chairs imported from Boston, that other cities advertised their own version of the so-called “Boston chair.” Select chairs dating from the 1700s to the 1950s will survey the impressive heritage of Boston seating furniture.",
