  "exhibition_title": "Holiday Traditions: Bowls with Punch",
  "exhibition_description": "Along with tea from China and chocolate from South America, an exotic beverage from India swept across the British Empire in the 17th and 18th centuries: punch. A concoction of spirits, citrus, spices, sugar, and water, punch was made in hundreds of variations on this basic recipe. From state dinners to tavern gatherings, it was the libation of choice for special occasions-particularly during the holidays. As it grew in popularity, so too did its specialized bowls, ladles, cups, glasses, and mugs made of ceramic, silver, or glass. The Institute will feature punch bowls from the 18th-20th centuries in the Bell Decorative Arts Court during this year’s Holiday Traditions exhibition, on view in the Period Rooms and at the Purcell-Cutts. Costumed docents will offer tours from Thanksgiving through New Year’s. ",
