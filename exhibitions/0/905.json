  "exhibition_title": "Friedlander: Photography",
  "exhibition_description": "Comprised of six early color portraits, nearly 500 black-and-white gelatin silver prints, and approximately 50 examples of Friedlander’s books, special editions, and portfolios, Friedlander: Photography traces a prolific career that continues to thrive after half a century. Supplemented by a modest number of loans from the artist, the retrospective is largely drawn from the Museum of Modern Art’s extensive collection of Friedlander’s work. There are groups of photographs, each narrowly tailored by date, theme, and style. Groups that present distilled versions of Friedlander’s books are identified as such. Completing the exhibition are seven displaying Friedlander’s portfolios and special editions. A fully illustrated catalogue accompanies the exhibition.",
