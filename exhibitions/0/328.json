  "exhibition_description": "The quilts included in this exhibition were drawn from the Minnesota Quilt Project, an organization that was founded in 1988 to document historic quilts and quilt makers in Minnesota. The quilts in the exhibition featured the star motif, a design theme that includes many popular patterns and one that was particularly favored by Native American quilt makers. All quilts were made in America, but were not limited to those made in Minnesota. The length of the exhibition incorporated two rotations of twenty quilts each.",
