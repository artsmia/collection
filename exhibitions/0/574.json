  "exhibition_description": "This refined exhibition of Roman sculpture features over thirty stone portraits dating from the first through third centuries. Selected from the private holdings of New York collector Dr. Michael Miller, the show is comprised of three-dimensional heads, relief fragments, and full figures. Features in the display are royal portraits including those of emperors Diocletian and Caesar Augustus; several private portraits of the aristocracy as well as a group of mythological portraits including Hercules, Cupid, and Zeus. The exhibit provides the viewer a fascinating look at some of the personalities, intriguing iconography, and refined sculpting techniques of classical antiquity that are not available in the museumâ€™s permanent collection of Roman sculpture. This thematic exhibit appeals tremendously to scholars and students of Roman art and anyone interested in classical history and art. A fully illustrated catalogue by Dr. Richard Brilliant accompanies the exhibition.",
