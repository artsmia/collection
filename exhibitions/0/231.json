  "exhibition_description": "This exhibition, drawn primarily from the Institute’s permanent collection, featured the work of about ten internationally known photographers. Their pictures spanned over one hundred years and represented every major movement in photography. Eadweard Muybridge, working in the late 19th-century, included nude men and women extensive analysis of human motion. Edward Steichen, as a turn-of-the-century pictorialist, idealized the nude, making evocative, soft-focus images. And Edward Weston, working after World War I, created modernist images of women, often emphasizing abstract shapes and forms. During the second half of the 20th-century, photographers such as Bill Brandt and July Coleman, continued to engage the human figure in a wide range of imagery, making it one of the medium’s most enduring subjects.",
