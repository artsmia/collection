  "exhibition_title": "Picturing History: Paintings and Studies of Art, Artifacts, Furniture and Architecture of the Minneapolis Institute of Arts by Richard Rock",
  "exhibition_description": "Formalism meets conceptualism in this exhibit, which explores the museum experience. Richard Rock painted in the galleries of the Minneapolis Institute of Art since 2001. His small oil paintings depict installations of the Asian and European galleries. Rock paints \"history from life\" to connect with the minds of the many historical artisans whose works are included in the museumâ€™s permanent collection. Abinadi Meza records the sounds of the museum to give visitors the opportunity to experience the sonic life of the MIA. Using standard and contact microphones, he records museum activity to create a sonic collage presented looped as a multi-channel sound installation.",
