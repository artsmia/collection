  "exhibition_description": "Nicholas Conberre, Michelle Johnson, Jack Pavlik and Sonja Peterson extend their use of line and the concept of drawing. Conberre’s invented landscapes of layered drawings and photos create complex, dreamlike panoramas. Johnson’s repetitive, overlapping patterns of calligraphic letters distort the original mark and create a new aesthetic identity. Pavik’s kinetic sculptures create visual and aural narratives of form and movement. Peterson’s cut-out drawings farmland and wildlife play with ideas of perception and reality.",
