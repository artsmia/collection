  "exhibition_description": "This exhibition and event series presented the work of four visual artists, three writers, and one art historian to explore the personal, cultural, and mythological significance of hair. “Hair Stories” featured visual and verbal texts dealing with body-related issues: mixed media work by Diane Katsiaficas, paintings by Nancy Robinson, mixed media work and handmade paper by Erica Spitzer Rasmussen, and a video installation by Mara Zoltners; text and readings by Paulette Alden Bates, Valerie Miner, and Mary François Rockcastle; and a curated presentation of hair weavings from private Minnesota collections by Michael Stoughton, who will also contribute an essay on the historical use of hair in art and ornament. And because everyone has personal associations with hair, the gallery design provided opportunities for museum visitors to contribute to a collaborative work.",
