  "exhibition_title": "John Howe in Minnesota: The Prairie School Legacy of Frank Lloyd Wright",
  "exhibition_description": "John (Jack) Howe was Frank Lloyd Wright’s talented chief draftsman from 1935 until Wright’s death in 1959. One of the first members of Wright’s Taliesin Fellowship, which was begun in 1932, Howe was schooled in the principles of organic architecture. In Wright’s studio, he directed the activities of the drafting room and completed many of Wright’s presentation drawings. Howe moved to Minnesota in the mid-1960s, where he ran his own architectural practice that focused, like Wright’s, on domestic architecture. This exhibition was comprised of 75 to 100 drawings mainly from the collections of the Northwest Architectural Archives, and the University Libraries, University of Minnesota. The exhibition coincides with the Frank Lloyd Wright Conservancy’s Annual Meeting, to be held September 20 – 24, 2000 in Minneapolis.",
