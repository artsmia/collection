  "exhibition_description": "\"Kitchen\" was a 150 square foot beaded environment of incredible detail. A grocery list hung from the refrigerator door, blue beads flowed from the sink spigot over a pile of dishes and a beaded cherry pie sat in the oven. The installation centered on the role of women in history and their labor-intensive work in the room where so many women have spent decades of their lives. The artist glorified the drudgery of domestic work and in so doing created a space for critical reflection about the role of women in the home and what is traditionally seen as \"women's work.\"",
