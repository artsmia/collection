  "exhibition_title": "Frank Lloyd Wright for Everyman: The Malcolm Willey House and the Lindholm Service Station",
  "exhibition_description": "This exhibition will explore two watershed designs that helped define the second half of Frank Lloyd Wright’s architectural career. The major portion of the exhibition will be devoted to the Malcolm Willey House, built in Minneapolis in 1934. The Willey House was the product of Wright’s radical rethinking of the single family home for the middle class, and served as a prototype for his later Usonian homes. As well, the exhibition will feature the Lindholm Service Station, built in Cloquet, Minnesota in 1958, where Wright combines commercial function and architectural daring. This design closely followed Wright’s 1932 service station for Broadacre City, his visionary--but unbuilt--American town plan. The exhibition will include original drawings from private collections and from the Frank Lloyd Wright Archives, as well as objects from the Willey House and photographs of the house’s recent award-winning restoration.",
