  "exhibition_description": "The Chinese Bronze Age (ca. 1900-221 BCE), perhaps the worldâ€™s most distinguished period of metal casting, is well known for its thousands of ritual vessels excavated from ancient tombs. Of similar importance were sets of bronze bells, which were used during ceremonies to mark the cadence of the elaborate rituals being performed. This exhibition will feature a set of 20 graduated bells - the largest group in a western museum - to explore the technical, artistic and musical characteristics of late Bronze Age bells. Ceramic substitute sets of the same period excavated from lesser burials will also be displayed.",
