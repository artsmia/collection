  "exhibition_title": "I Will Follow You Into the Dark: Paintings by Megan Rye",
  "exhibition_description": "Megan Ryeâ€™s latest body of work is largely based on photographs her brother took while stationed in Iraq as a United States Marine. Her large format, photo-realist paintings are saturated with theatrical lighting and bright colors to emphasize the ominous nature of the situation. Three artists come together for this exhibition to explore issues of military representation in popular culture; the relationship between patriotism and fear and the way war and conflict is brought into our homes. Justin Newhall presents large-format, color photographs of historical battle re-enactments. Megan Vossler creates delicate graphite renderings from public images of marching troops, soldiers and refugees. Camille Gage alters military photographs, reducing the images to their essential and most powerful elements.",
