  "exhibition_title": "Times Squared: Photographs by Toby Old",
  "exhibition_description": "Oldâ€™s work has always been characterized by a solid technical mastery of the medium format camera as the tool for his wonderfully zany, insightful and intelligent observation of the American scene. His subjects range from public events and situations such as Coney Island and Times Square, to county fairs, street theater, and professional boxing. Also included are images of the New York nightclub scene of the 1970s, fashion shows, and other displays of vanity and public preening. The photographs evoke an amusing though gently caustic, tongue-in-cheek satire on how we present ourselves to the world.",
