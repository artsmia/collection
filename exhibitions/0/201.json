  "exhibition_description": "Arnold Newman is one of the best-known and most distinguished portrait photographers of the 20th century. He pioneered “environmental portraiture,” a style that places the subject in a carefully composed setting that captures the essence of their work and personality. Since the 1930s, Newman has used his impeccable technique and innovative strategies to photograph many of the most accomplished people of the century – artists, writers, actors, composers, politicians and others – for publications such as Life, Holiday, Fortune and The New Yorker.",
