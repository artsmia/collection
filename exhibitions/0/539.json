  "exhibition_description": "How have Americans become aware of who designs their everyday objects? With the advent of industrial production in the mid-19th century, household goods flooded European and American homes, but they were for the most part unattractive, owing to the little regard manufacturers gave toward their appearance. The 1930s introduced Americans to industrial designers such as Raymond Loewy, Henry Dreyfuss, and Walter Dorwin Teague, who became well known through their streamlined approach to everything from automobiles to thermostats, and through their books on the subject of design. By the 1940s, as consumers began to embrace modern design, manufacturers made a point of marketing goods under the “brand names”of their designers. Russel and Mary Wright and Charles and Ray Eames positioned themselves as practitioners of a new, casual lifestyle for which their modern products were perfectly suited. Today, with the faces and signatures of Philippe Starck and Michael Graves prominently featured on packaging, designers are often better known than their merchandise. Through objects from the Institute’s collection and from private collections, “Household Names”examines the designer’s rise to recognition in modern Ameerica.",
