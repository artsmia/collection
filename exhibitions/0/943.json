  "exhibition_description": "As a photographer and a scientist, Vance Gellert has traveled to Bolivia and Peru to observe native healing rituals, environments and plants. The photographs and actual healing objects from these journeys of discovery evoke a spirit of place, culture and healing traditions. They transcend cultural differences to create a receptive and stimulating environment in which to consider new directions and methodology in health care. His exhibition illustrates how art can contribute to scientific understanding of our world.",
