  "exhibition_description": "Freddy Munoz’s recent paintings are apocalyptic works of extraordinary vision and scale that combine the bravado of mid-20th century American abstraction and the complexity of European tradition with a real fury about injustice. As a painter, Munoz speaks to disconnection in epic terms, making a powerful case for the transformation of human consciousness. His paintings are apocalyptic in the most dynamic sense—in Munoz’s world revelation can serve as an alchemical flashpoint. His colossal cataclysmic images provoke the viewer into a rethinking about daily practice. Combining the diverse influences of Giotto, Velasquez and Chaim Soutine, Munoz's paintings mix spirituality with irreverence and hope, exploring the dark side in order to see the light.",
