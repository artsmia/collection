  "exhibition_description": "This exhibition of figurative works by James Cleary and Chris Mars runs a gamut of emotion from Cleary’s lowbrow humor to Mars’ compassion for the suffering of others. Through his series of irreverent mixed media drawings Cleary illustrates his perception of the human condition and what he calls “ the results of our spiritual weakness.” Mars makes meticulous and fantastical paintings that explore the issues surrounding mental illness. Always seeking to comfort and liberate those perceived as “monsters,” Mars’s works to reveal the beauty underlying a whole cast of troubled characters. ",
