  "exhibition_title": "Our Mother Mary Found: Maria, Nostra Madre Ritrovata",
  "exhibition_description": "Our Mother Mary Found re-contextualizes the story of Mary by asserting her Jewish origin as part of her identity. This project revisits the story of the iconic \"Madonna,\" and represents her as a woman who embodies two faiths. Ten rustic wooden household tools collected in Italy are gilded with Jewish prayers that correspond to fragments of Maryâ€™s life. Our Mother Mary F ound conveys the more pragmatic reality of a woman whose daily labor as a mother and a faithful Jew gave birth to a prophet and nurtured a revolutionary.",
