  "exhibition_description": "Jantje Visscher and Mary Griep will exhibit meditative works the invite exploration and contemplation—Visscher in the form of minimalist sculpture and Griep in highly detailed large-scale drawings.\r\nJantje Visscher’s work deals with perception, especially with the forms and patterns in nature, and the way we perceive and relate to the universe we live in. In her large-scale wall works Visscher uses four-inch ribbons of clear plastic to create focused light projections and shadows. The resulting patterns of light and shadow engulf the wall and cause the plastic to almost disappear.",
