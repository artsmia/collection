  "exhibition_description": "The Sacred Symbols exhibition provided a unique opportunity to see the arts created by the people of the ancient Americas in all their beauty, variety and complexity. It featured works from a selection of the notable civilizations found throughout North, Central and South America, objects ranging in time of creation from 2500 BC to the initial period of contact with Europeans in the 16th century. These pieces represented a great variety of artistic styles powerfully expressing the fundamental religious, historical and political aspects of the lives of the people who created them. \r\nAll of the approximately 180 objects in the exhibition were selected from the collections of American museums in the FRAME (French Regional American Museums Exchange) consortium and are masterpieces reflecting the strongest works available throughout the United States. Highlights of the show included elegant ceramics decorated with abstract and representational art designs from the Southwestern region of the present United States, as well as refined stone sculptures, ceramics and personal ornaments from the Southeast. Ancient Mexican cultures were represented by the superbly carved jade statues of figures and animals of the Olmec, the expertly painted ceramic vessels illustrating themes from mythology and history, and elaborately carved stone figures created by artists of the Maya civilization, and the inventive ceramic sculptures from the people of the Colima, Nayarit and Jalisco regions representing different aspects of everyday life. From Central America there were magnificent golden ornaments fashioned in the form of human beings, mythological figures and animals, which were used by chiefs and other people of high status to adorn themselves and mark their status. There were also beautifully modeled and painted ceramics from Ancient Peru, representing individuals, animals and objects from the ceremonial and political culture of the Moche and Nazca people, plus some highly ornamented Incan vessels that showed the interaction of Nat",
