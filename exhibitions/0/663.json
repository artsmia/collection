The Katherine Kierland Herberger Collection of Banks found a permanent home at The Minneapolis Institute of Arts, where a newly dedicated gallery on the ground floor between the Family Center and classrooms showcases rotating exhibitions of the collection. The first exhibition, titled “Buildings to Bank On: Selections from the Katherine Kierland Herberger Collection of Banks,” featured more than one hundred examples of architectural banks that are sure to delight visitors of all ages.",
