  "exhibition_description": "This exhibition documented an important episode of typographic design through the collection of The Minneapolis Institute of Arts. It traced the progression of innovative letterforms from the turn of the 20th century to the 1950s, roughly a sixty-year period in which typography reflected the tremendous upheaval generated by the avant-garde in all the arts. Those advances made in a series of modernist movements, from Arts and Crafts, Art Nouveau, Dadaism, De Stijl, and Russian Constructivism through the Bauhaus, were graphically captured.",
