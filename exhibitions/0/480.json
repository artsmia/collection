  "exhibition_description": "The Minnesota Artists Exhibition Program (MAEP) presented \"In Situ\", which featured new paintings by contemporary artists Jil Evans, James Holmberg, and Cristi Rinklin, three artists engaged with the creative connections between their paintings and the spaces that they occupy. Named for the Latin phrase, in situ, which means, roughly, \"in the original location,\" the exhibition presented Evan's pseudo-figurative works, suspended overhead, to suggest the ceiling of a Baroque interior; Holmberg' s large-scale minimalist canvases, accompanied by painted \"details\" of the larger works; and Rinklin' s lush, wonder-filled oval paintings, \"framed\" with paint placed directly onto the gallery wall. Through their collaborative planning and process, the In Situ\" artists established the exhibit's site-specific considerations, including what paintings to execute, object placement, color and lighting, and gallery design. Their installation offered a progression of experiences designed to heighten perceptual awareness for the viewer, illuminating the relationship between abstraction and observation. ",
