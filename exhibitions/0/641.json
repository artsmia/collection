  "exhibition_description": "This was an exhibition of neo-feminist narratives by printmakers Faye Passow and Jenny Schmid. Faye Passow that dealt with feminine identity and family dysfunction in a series of humorous lithographs depicting multiple calamities converging on small family groups. Jenny Schmid’s double-edged work deals with the drug use of women and girls through history. Inspired by historical documents, especially the 19th century use of morphine to “calm the nerves” of depressed young women, Schmid’s lithographs presented allegorical images of “things that cause teen-aged girls to be bad”.",
