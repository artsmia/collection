  "exhibition_title": "Currents of Change: Art and Life Along the Mississippi River, 1850-1861",
  "exhibition_description": "America’s development was at one of its most dramatic moments in the 1850s, a decade celebrated along the Mississippi River as the 50th anniversary of the Louisiana Purchase and the westward expedition of Lewis and Clark. Currents of Change will explore the fine and decorative arts along the river during that period. America was undergoing extraordinary changes: from the steamboat era to the advent of the railroad, from a mostly agrarian economy to the beginnings of the industrial revolution, from a nation of youthful optimism to one which would soon erupt into civil war. Fortunes made from lumber and lead processing in the North and cotton and sugar production in the South gave birth to the great cities along the river that we know today, and financed the demand for sophisticated furnishings and a “refined” life. The Mississippi, which had long been a channel for trade, was becoming an important conduit for ideas about art, culture, and design.\r\nCurrents of Change brings together approximately 175 objects in all media: paintings, prints, and drawings, furniture, silver, ceramics, textiles, and sculpture. The exhibition includes a 16-foot segment from the only extant panorama of the Mississippi River (a 340-foot-long moving landscape), to be shown in a theatrical setting that recalls how viewers of the 1850s would have seen it.\r\nAn illustrated catalogue accompanies the exhibition.",
