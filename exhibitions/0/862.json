  "exhibition_description": "Hiddur Mitzvah is a Hebrew phrase that means “adornment of the commandment.” It refers to the admonishment set forth in Jewish law to create the most beautiful ceremonial objects possible in order to enhance religious rituals. Hiddur Mitzvah’s roots were established when Moses sang, “This is my God and I will glorify Him” (Exodus 15:2). Such ornamentation of ritual objects is considered an example of Mitzvot, or good deeds. This exhibition explores the concept of Hiddur Mitzvah by featuring ceremonial objects and textiles from the Minneapolis Institute of Arts and private collections that demonstrate the highest quality in craftsmanship and materials.
