  "exhibition_description": "The company developed by Jack Lenor Larsen has long been known for its distinctive interiors textiles that exalt the wonder of natural fibers and highlight their unique textures. However the Larsen design studio has never been limited by stereotypes and in the mid 60’s they created a line of clothing fabric under the JaeL label of dramatic prints on a synthetic knit, the new wonder fabric of that decade. Colors were often bright and demanded attention while patterns ranged from abstract to figural repetitions of exotic birds and animals such as tigers and leopards. The JaeL line received considerable acclaim but production demands in the fashion world differed so greatly from the creation of interiors fabrics, which were the focus of the company, that the line was discontinued after 3 years. Buried within the company’s archives, these textiles have not been seen for decades and it is the first time they have been highlighted in a museum. ",
