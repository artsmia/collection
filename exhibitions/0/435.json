  "exhibition_description": "This exhibition focused on the glass sculptor Howard Ben Tré’s public projects for plazas and streetscapes, which are an increasingly important part of his work. A major component of the exhibition was the project recently approved by Target Corporation for their new public plaza in downtown Minneapolis. Howard Ben Tré is a very important player in the studio glass movement that developed in the 1960s and 1970s in Providence, Rhode Island. He has produced sculptures in cast translucent glass, employing an industrial process and medium known to him from working in various trades as a young man. His pieces exhibited extreme control and symmetry, and resembled ancient archeological finds. The sculptures developed as freestanding works that combine totemic forms with light (transmitted and reflected) and water to create a transcendent experience that invites human interaction. ",
