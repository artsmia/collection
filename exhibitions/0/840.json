  "exhibition_description": "Minneapolis collectors, Gabe and Yvonne Weisberg, have collected drawings for over thirty years. This exhibition will include approximately seventy-five drawings, watercolors, and pastels from their collection. The collection focuses on realist and naturalist artists working in France and Belgium in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Many of these artists are unknown to museum visitors of this era, thus this exhibition will introduce the excellent work of Adolphe Appian, François Bonvin, Jules Breton, Edgar Chahine, Louis Weldon Hawkins, Auguste Lepère, Léon Lhermitte, Charles Milcendeau, and Thèodule Ribot to a wider audience. \r\nA fully illustrated catalogue accompanies the exhibition.
