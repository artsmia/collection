  "exhibition_title": "Wind and Whimsy: Weathervanes and Whirligigs from Twin Cities Collections",
  "exhibition_description": "Weathervanes have been used throughout history to predict changes in the weather based on the direction of the wind. While form always followed function, weathervanes came in a variety of shapes, including animals, banners, arrows, and various human figures. Early American colonists continued the European tradition by placing handmade vanes on churches, public meetinghouses, and barns. This exhibition features weathervanes and whirligigs from the MIA collection alongside loans from prominent local collections and includes both handmade folk art and manufactured examples from the eighteenth through the 20th centuries.",
