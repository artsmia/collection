  "exhibition_description": "River to Infinity - The Vanishing Points is the summation of a series of reflective mirrored landscape installations that present the viewer with visually constructed cultural dualities. The work points to the convergence of manifest destiny, contemporary American environmental values, and the vanishing of the natural world by recognizing the demise of species, peoples, and, through metaphor, society. At the same time, River to Infinity celebrates the excesses and the opalescent beauty of western culture in a fantasia of recontextualization: the work exists as a place of inspiration and horror. At first, the opulence gratifies and distracts the viewer. As time passes, the viewer is reflected in the mirrored surfaces of the installation, triggering an awareness of personal complicity and entrapment in a web of causation. \r\nRiver to Infinity is an entirely reflective landscape containing a mirrored river. On the banks of the river, reflective floral and fauna of endangered and extinct species coexist with fantastic and ambiguous reflective animals borne of recombinant DNA technology. At both end points of the river, separated by its length, video projections of constantly changing American landscapes play on the walls of the space. As the videos are projected, they are reflected on the mirrored surfaces of the river and its sculptural life forms. ",
