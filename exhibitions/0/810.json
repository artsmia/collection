  "exhibition_title": "Chris Larson: The Great American Crush Collision",
  "exhibition_description": "Chris Larson gains inspiration for his current installation from the planned collision of two 32-ton locomotives in the town of Crush, Texas on September 15, 1896. The crash represented the clash of two cultures—the North and the South, and thrilled spectators as they watched the latest technology and economic power explode in a ball of flame and twisted metal.\r\nLarson’s “collisions” of objects from America's past, present and future culture present a conversation between different and similar worlds. In a world where people, ideals, thoughts, race, beliefs, art, religion and politics are constantly colliding, Larson literally smashes them together to see what unfolds.",
