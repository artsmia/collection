  "exhibition_description": "This exhibition by figurative works by Davora M. Lindner and Margo Selski features a theatrical display of androgynous ceramic dolls by Lindner and a series of mysterious oil paintings by Selski. Lindner maintains an obsessive relationship with the body and gender and considers many of the puppet-like figures she creates to be surrogates or self-portraits. Selski paintings merge some of the qualities and pictorial traditions of Flemish masterpieces with images of myth and reality. Her ghost-like figures play out layered and mysterious narratives leading the viewer through a maze of awareness, accentuating history, ambiguity and melancholia. ",
