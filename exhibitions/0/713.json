  "exhibition_title": "The Water Remembers: Recent Paintings by May Stevens 1990-2004",
  "exhibition_description": "This exhibition consists of large-scale paintings on unstretched canvas and works on paper by the American feminist/activist artist May Stevens (born Boston, 1924). In a series of thematically related works, Stevens explores the concept of an enduring universal consciousness that she believes underlies all human experience. She reveals her own spiritual connection to the world through the depiction of luminous bodies of water – aquatic landscapes – which often feature abstracted sequences of words extracted from texts ranging from Virginia Wolff to Irish poetry of the 5th century BCE. These text fragments serve as memetic cues – reminders of a common human spirituality. For Stevens, these poetic and highly personal works of art evoke a sense of continuance, connection between people, and the transient nature of time, place and life.",
