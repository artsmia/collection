  "exhibition_title": "Tom Arndt's Minnesota",
  "exhibition_description": "Tom Arndt (born 1944) has persistently chronicled everyday life in Minnesota since the early 1970s. His straightforward and insightful black-and-white images span the state geographically, emotionally, and spiritually. He covered the vice-presidential campaign of Walter Mondale in 1984, has photographed the State Fair for years, and is most at home with ordinary Minnesotans on the street and in their homes. Thomas Frederick Arndt is Minnesotaâ€™s leading documentary photography of the last thirty-five years. The exhibition will include 75 photographs from the MIA permanent collection and the artist. A fully illustrated catalogue accompanies the exhibition.",
