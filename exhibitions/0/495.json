  "exhibition_description": "The Jewish alms container known as the tzedekah box occupies a unique place among Jewish ritual objects. Whereas other religious objects are bound by their ritual purpose, the tzedekah box is unaffiliated. The word tzedekah is derived from the root “tzadek”, meaning justice or righteousness. Tzedekah is the Jewish commandment to provide for those that are less fortunate as a means of bringing justice to the world. Tzedekah boxes come in all shapes in sizes thereby offering unlimited opportunities for artists to interpret them. The project will send an invitation to local Jewish and non-Jewish artists, inviting them to create a tzedekah box. Approximately 30 winning designs will be displayed at community sites and culminate with an exhibition at The Minneapolis Institute of Arts. The Tzedekah Box Project will challenge viewers/participants to question their own place in society; their responsibilities to their community; and their ability to be social change agents. It will ask us to reflect on ways in which we could have been changed by philanthropy and ways in which our community may have been transformed by another’s generosity.",
