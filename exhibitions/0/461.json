  "exhibition_description": "A double exhibition featuring a new film and sculpture by Chris Larson and an installation by drawing-based artist Melissa Stang. Known for his giant wooden machines “that work in the minds of the viewer,” Chris Larson presented his second film project that uses his sculpture as a theatrical set. As creative director, actor, set designer, and builder, Larsen used poetic themes of Americana and vaudeville to extend his inquiry into metamorphosis, the sacred and profane, or what country western music calls, “Saturday Night/Sunday Morning. In her exhibit, Homo domesticus, Melissa Stang presented two new works. One, a monumental assembled painting that sought to reconcile the expectations she feels as a woman artist; the other, a domestic interior of a mysterious herpetologist filled with kitschy decorative art objects depicting reptiles and amphibians. A table set with three-legged frog patterned plates (all drawn by Stang) reminded us to heed nature’s warnings and pays homage to the humble creatures who have given their lives for “human progress.”",
