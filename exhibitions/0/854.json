  "exhibition_description": "This is an exhibition of Central Asian embroidery made at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century (ca 1880-1930). This exhibition will consist of approximately 60 non-utilitarian (no clothing) embroidery made by peoples making the transition between nomadic and agrarian life styles. It will also include a few urban wall panels.The horse-breeding Lakai, agrarian Kungrat and settled peoples of Samarkand and Bukhara who created these embroideries all lived their lives on the exotic silk road that still excites our imagination. Their textiles reflect the diversity and rich aesthetic traditions of Central Asia as well as the identity and cultural values of their creators. This exhibition is drawn from the superb collection of Central Asian embroideries given to The Minneapolis Institute of Arts in 2004 by Jack and Aviva Robinson. A fully illustrated catalogues accompanies the exhibition. ",
