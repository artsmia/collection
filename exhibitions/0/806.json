  "exhibition_title": "Photogravure: Photographs in Ink",
  "exhibition_description": "Photogravure is the most lavish process by which photographs are rendered in printer’s ink. Invented in the late nineteenth century, it has been used since then by creative photographers interested in the rich, continuous tones of this intaglio process. Alfred Stieglitz illustrated his landmark periodical “Camera Work” with photogravures by Frederick H. Evans, Gertrude Käsebier, and others intent upon proving the artistic value of photography. From 1907 to 1930 Edward Curtis used the process to produce his mammoth and unrivaled record, “The North American Indian.” Paul Strand’s most significant portfolio, sensitively depicting Mexican culture, was printed in photogravure. And contemporary photographers such as Carrie Mae Weems and Bernice Ficek-Swenson also warmly embrace the process. The exhibition featured about 75 photogravures, all from the permanent collection of The Minneapolis Institute of Arts.",
