  "exhibition_description": "Packages of all sorts have come a long way since the plain brown bundles depicted in Victorian Christmas scenes. Advances in construction, printing, and mechanization throughout the 20th century have resulted in “graphic” developments for the simple shopping bag and hatbox. They serves as portable billboards for the store, and once home, can live on as containers for keepsakes—often becoming keepsakes themselves. As department stores and boutiques increasingly consider packaging as an extension of their service and identity, they look to designers for more attractive wrappings. Artists such as Erté, Roy Lichtenstein, Salvador Dali, Andy Warhol, and Frank Stella have accepted commissions to design shopping bags, many of them considered portable art by museums and collectors. \r\nIn the Twin Cities, such fashion-forward retailers as Young-Quinlan, Field-Schlick, and Dayton’s invested considerable effort and imagination into their packaging. The Institute will feature these and other designs from local shops in the Bell Decorative Arts Court during this year’s Holiday Traditions exhibition, on view in the Period Rooms and at the Purcell-Cutts house November 26, 2004 through January 2, 2005. Costumed docents will offer tours from Thanksgiving through New Year’s Eve.",
