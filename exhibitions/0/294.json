  "exhibition_description": "This exhibition presented a retrospective of the work of St. Paul artist George Resler (1882-1954). It included a selection of etchings, drypoints, and drawings of Resler's preferred subject of landscape as well as portraits of family and friends. Many of his landscapes featured Minnesota scenes and St. Paul in particular. Resler was inspired by the painter-etchers of the 19th century such as James McNeill Whistler, Seymour Haden and Alphonse Legros. This exhibition reintroduced the artist to the general public and marks the first time the Institute exhibited the works of George Resler. A publication accompanied the exhibition.",
