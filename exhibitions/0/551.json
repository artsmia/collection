  "exhibition_description": "This exhibition featured more than thirty of the Chinese paintings acquired in recent years through the generosity of Joan Wurtele. The exhibit included small, lyrical landscapes and bird and flower paintings of the Southern Sung dynasty (1127–1279); delicate ink landscapes of the important early Ming (1368–1644); as well as work by Wu school artists, and some fine Buddhist paintings. Also included were representative professional and literati landscape paintings of the late Ming and Ch’ing dynasties (1644–1911), including works by Ku I-te (active 1608–33), Cha Shih-piao (1615–98), Kung Hsien (1619–89), and Lan Ying (1585-1664). Each of these paintings was selected with the museum’s collecting needs in mind. Care was taken to add significant scrolls that helped achieve our goal of building as representative and high quality a collection of Chinese paintings as possible.",
