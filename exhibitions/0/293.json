  "exhibition_description": "The century between 1750 and 1850 , often referred to as the \"golden age\" of British landscape art, when the genre reached perhaps its highest level of achievement and recognition. This exhibition was designed to survey the work of the leading British landscape artists of the period, with a special emphasis on watercolors and prints. The exhibition featured more than 180 prints, drawings, watercolors and paintings drawn from the Institute's permanent collection and other institutional and private collections. A selection of prints and preparatory drawings from Turner's landmark publication Liber Studiorum, was highlighted. A technical display and a selection of English decorative arts was also shown.\r\nAn illustrated catalogue was produced by The Minneapolis Institute of Arts.",
