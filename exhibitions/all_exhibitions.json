Worldwide Africa: Fashioning Personhood challenges conventional ideas of African aesthetics and personhood. As in the larger African art galleries, the theme of mobility and the wide circulation of ideas and influences from within and without the continent characterize the work of young African artists and designers. Their contemporary innovative work highlights the international reach of the African continent, featuring the rich exchange of African creativity with global cultures, periods, and styles.",

Bresnahan, who apprenticed with the Japanese Nakazato family of potters, well known for his skillfully thrown, uniquely-glazed ceramics and for his commitment to the environment -- used materials indigenous to Minnesota and stoked his kiln with waste wood gathered from the forests surrounding St. John's.  The successful firing of the enormous 1,200 cubic feet, three-chamber kiln marked a high point in Bresnahan's artistic career.  In addition to the subtle hues of natural ash glazes, the final chamber of the kiln also yielded unglazed ceramics with flash marks of bright reds and oranges, and contrasting soft tans and browns.  This exhibition included 50-60 of these objects, and included large-scale storage jars, vases, platters, and teabowls.",

When the Spanish brought Catholicism to Mexico it added other components to the traditional annual observance of Day of the Dead which is held on All Souls Day (November 2) in Mexico.  The ancient indigenous people of Mexico did not see death as and end but as part of a never ending cycle.  On Day of the Dead, people visit the graveyards of deceased family members and in homes, and makeshift altars are created and decorated with flowers and photos of the deceased loved ones.  The Mexican tradition is filled with both humor and sadness, and reminds all of us that no matter what our personal religious beliefs may be, life is precious and to be fully enjoyed.  This exhibition is the nation's largest on the subject, and combines both traditional and contemporary components of this intriguing holiday. Included are artists from Mexico, Chicago, and from other parts of the U.S.",

As an art student in Karlsruhe and Berlin in the 1870s, Klinger came to believe that only the graphic arts could express the extremes of fantasy and emotion, which were inappropriate to the more realistic arts of painting and sculpture.  The 14 print portfolios Klinger created between 1879 and 1915 were instrumental in reviving the art of etching and graphic arts in turn-of-the-century Germany.  The exhibition featured the portfolios, A Glove and Intermezzi, which date from 1881, yet anticipated the dream-like imagery and macabre themes of 20th-century surrealism.",

While multiple examples of such masters as Schongauer, Dürer and Rembrandt were included, some of the emphasis of the exhibition were on artists from the less widely-shown periods and fields, such as the 16th century etchers of the School of Fontainebleu.

This region’s diverse landscape - its wide horizons and high arctic sky - has profoundly influenced her work.  Well known for her elegantly evocative paintings of magical plant-filled environments, Kreft had depicted mysterious light-filled spaces containing pods, seeds, and various floating organic forms that seem to reflect psychological states of being.  Her recent paintings speak to the luminous beauty of the earth.  They present natural phenomena and life pattern in simpler spaces that suggest constellations of various sorts.  The atmospheric and reductive quality of these large canvases heightened their contemplative effect and encouraged the viewer to linger in the artist’s ethereal landscape.",

This exhibition featured a group of paintings by Monet that examined the decisive moment of personal and artistic development during which the artist employed the concept of serial painting that was to dominate his later work.

Nearly 160 years later, Gus Foster, an American panoramic landscape photographer, was determined to retrace Hiroshige’s footsteps.  His 360° photographs, taken while walking the entire 306 mile route, strikingly document Japan’s metamorphosis in the twentieth century.  This exhibition paired each artists’ conception of the fifty-three “stations” of the Tokaido, revealing not only radical changes in Japan’s topography, but also the vast differences between artists’ inspiration, materials and creative interpretation.",

Eadweard Muybridge, working in the late 19th-century, included nude men and women extensive analysis of human motion. Edward Steichen, as a turn-of-the-century pictorialist, idealized the nude, making evocative, soft-focus images. And Edward Weston, working after World War I, created modernist images of women, often emphasizing abstract shapes and forms. During the second half of the 20th-century, photographers such as Bill Brandt and July Coleman, continued to engage the human figure in a wide range of imagery, making it one of the medium’s most enduring subjects.",

Alexa Horochowski scrutinized that behemoth institution known as marriage in a multi-sensory laundry room equipped with bubbles, a working ringer washer, and clothes line installed with embroidered underwear. Lee Anne Swanson combined hi-tech materials and lo-tech ideas in an installation that accessorized a huge, moody painting with a line of waist-high livestock tanks containing splashing glitter-covered mechanical duck decoys. Carolyn Swiszcz revealed her love for accidental gesture and material flexibility in a giant eraser board mandala.",

In Wright’s studio, he directed the activities of the drafting room and completed many of Wright’s presentation drawings. Howe moved to Minnesota in the mid-1960s, where he ran his own architectural practice that focused, like Wright’s, on domestic architecture. This exhibition was comprised of 75 to 100 drawings mainly from the collections of the Northwest Architectural Archives, and the University Libraries, University of Minnesota.

Led by the example of James McNeill Whistler, a generation of Americans studied abroad to absorb the new palette and compositions that were modernizing painting. Landscapes, figure and still life paintings, by Childe Hassam John Twachtman, Thomas Dewing, Maria Oakey Dewing, William Merrit Chase, and Theodore Robinson, marked a distinct departure from academic styles. In Boston, Edmund Tarbell, Frank Benson, Robert Reid, and Frederick Carl Frieseke developed a genteel version of Impressionism related to the culture of that city.  Landscapes and cityscapes by such artists as Daniel Garber and Maurice Prendergast carried Impressionism further into modernism by creating a new tapestry-like effect in their canvases. Taken together, these Impressionists foretold a new internationalism and modern view of life as America approached the twentieth century.",

Diligent explorers of the physical worlds they are both drawn to places that seem to stretch over time – empty dock yards, railroad yards, industrial sites, architectural landmarks, and myriad nighttime haunts. Chris Faust is well known for panoramic black-and-white photographs of landscape, images often filled with contradiction and the enduring tension between humans and nature. A disciplined and masterly technician, Faust achieves lush tonal quality through a process called compensation development, which hear leaned from John Sexton, a student of Ansel Adams. Mike Lynch has been recognized for decades as an artist whose oil paintings, watercolors, and drawings display rare economy and sensitivity. He has devoted himself to night scenes since 1953, when he began painting in earnest. Lynch creates his evocative work through the use of time-honored practices such as nineteenth-century British watercolor techniques.",

The new religion intertwined traditional Native American beliefs with Christianity and spawned a new artistic tradition. This exhibition explored the ways the Native American Church has helped Native peoples in developing and preserving their identity while assisting in their adjustment to new social, cultural and economic circumstances. A wide range of artistic techniques and media evolved throughout the history of this religion to produce a distinctive genre of Native American art. The traditional expressive forms of beadwork, carving, metal smithing and feather work were combined to produce exquisite fans, rattles, drumsticks, jewelry, ritual staffs and other ceremonial objects used during the services of the Church. An understanding of the emergence of forms provides insight into the changing nature of American Indian life and art during the 20th-century.",

In 1980, 740 artists submitted work for installation.  MAEP’s 1989-90 Artist Panel determined that this unusual exhibition format still served to acknowledge the vast amount of creative work being done in the state and staged a second show, ten years after the first. In 1990, 882 artists participated in the project.  Today, nearly two decades after the original “Foot”, the MAEP is still fundamentally and creatively committed to the democratic process.  And, the Artist Panel is still intrigued with this massive exhibition that forms itself entirely in the absence of curatorial judgment. Ultimately, The Foot in the Door 2000 celebrated the incredible diversity of vision that has evolved within Minnesota’s artist community.",

The rooms also address divergent aesthetic trends that arose during the sixteenth century in Japan: one that reflected the flamboyant tastes of Japan's warrior rulers, and the other that suggests the tea masters' admiration for the humble, simple and rustic.

Because of the Industrial Revolution, the art of wood turning only started to be revived in America in the 1930s through the impetus of James Prestini (represented in the MIA collection). Following WWII, interest in pure design and the influences of Scandinavia inspired the likes of Bob Stocksdale and Philip Moulthrop. Their successors have pushed the limits of the medium ever since. The more experimental and challenging approach to wood turning between the 1960s and the 1990s was the main focus of this exhibition.",

While focusing principally on physical design, function, styling and overall aesthetics, the implications for the appreciation of typography cannot be ignored, especially today with the advent of computerized desktop publishing.",

Known for his giant wooden machines “that work in the minds of the viewer,” Chris Larson presented his second film project that uses his sculpture as a theatrical set. As creative director, actor, set designer, and builder, Larsen used poetic themes of Americana and vaudeville to extend his inquiry into metamorphosis, the sacred and profane, or what country western music calls, “Saturday Night/Sunday Morning. In her exhibit, Homo domesticus, Melissa Stang presented two new works. One, a monumental assembled painting that sought to reconcile the expectations she feels as a woman artist; the other, a domestic interior of a mysterious herpetologist filled with kitschy decorative art objects depicting reptiles and amphibians. A table set with three-legged frog patterned plates (all drawn by Stang) reminded us to heed nature’s warnings and pays homage to the humble creatures who have given their lives for “human progress.”",

Grupo Soap produces and presents an ongoing series of exhibitions and projects that acknowledge, in particular, the Latinization of Lake Street in Minneapolis, with its mercados, taquerias, tortillerias, Latin record stores, nightclubs, boot shops, and salons. The Frontera Six borrowed from Mexican popular culture, each assumed the persona of an imaginary professional wrestler. In creating their own pop-wrestler characters, each Frontera artist invented a distinct personality and stage name, complete with masks and costumes. These theatrical characters worked to advertise the exhibition as well as to reconcile and celebrate \"high\" and \"low\" art. The artwork featured in the gallery installation included tiny landscapes painted on corn, rice, and other seeds by Salvador Espejo Benitez, depicted scenes of Minnesota on one side, and of Mexico, on the other. Luis Fitch's mixed-media work illustrated the opportunities that have drawn Mexicans to Minnesota as well as the risks that they have taken to cross over. A Central American-style trinket cart by Alexa Horochowski was packed with saleable art miniatures including hand-painted surrogate wrestling figures of the Frontera artists themselves. Douglas Padilla's intense symbolist paintings referenced the North and the South, connecting the Mississippi with the desert. Chilean painter Marcela Rodriguez A. was inspired by her Latino students and the landscape of her homeland. Xavier Tavera's large-scale color photographs revealed Latinos as both visible and invisible.",

The culmination of a six-year project photographing the olive orchards and sacred trees of Spoleto, Italy, it revealed JoAnn Verburg’s profound interest in the reciprocity between humans and nature. The exhibition addressed the interrelatedness of life cycles, agriculture, and commerce and the mystery of sacred landscape. The installation reflected a sensitivity to architecture, human scale, and implied and actual time— issues more often addressed by installation art, architecture, or theater than by conventional photography. Verburg saw the olive tree, a life form essential to Italian culture, as a powerful metaphor for exchange. She made a gift of these works in her presentation of living cultural icons that do much to stimulate our own wonder and our own relationships with place and with what is sacred in nature.",

A major component of the exhibition was the project recently approved by Target Corporation for their new public plaza in downtown Minneapolis. Howard Ben Tré is a very important player in the studio glass movement that developed in the 1960s and 1970s in Providence, Rhode Island. He has produced sculptures in cast translucent glass, employing an industrial process and medium known to him from working in various trades as a young man. His pieces exhibited extreme control and symmetry, and resembled ancient archeological finds. The sculptures developed as freestanding works that combine totemic forms with light (transmitted and reflected) and water to create a transcendent experience that invites human interaction. ",

They sought to integrate art with life and move beyond what they perceived as the limits of Impressionism. Although the Nabis were trained as painters, they applied their talents to decorative objects and home interiors, theater design and programs, book and magazine illustration, as well as posters and prints. This installation highlighted a selection of their graphic works culled from the permanent collection.",

Alfred Stieglitz illustrated his landmark periodical “Camera Work” with photogravures by Frederick H. Evans, Gertrude Käsebier, and others intent upon proving the artistic value of photography. From 1907 to 1930 Edward Curtis used the process to produce his mammoth and unrivaled record, “The North American Indian.” Paul Strand’s most significant portfolio, sensitively depicting Mexican culture, was printed in photogravure. And contemporary photographers such as Carrie Mae Weems and Bernice Ficek-Swenson also warmly embrace the process. The exhibition featured about 75 photogravures, all from the permanent collection of The Minneapolis Institute of Arts.",

    "exhibition_description": "The etchings of Charles Meryon (1821-1879) reveal a vision of Paris before the changes put into effect during the rule of Napoleon III's Second Empire. Meryon's prints capture the essence of the medieval sections of town that were being torn down to accommodate the wide boulevards and new parks and squares of the Emperor's master plan. Yet, Meryon's etchings are not simply exact renditions of vanishing structures, but a personal vision of a city he loved. This vision was darkened by a severe mental illness which eventually took the artist's life just as his etchings were receiving serious attention and favorable reviews. Meryon's legacy of beautifully executed etchings continues to fascinate viewers, and he is considered on of the most gifted printmakers of all time.",

The exhibition addresses the evolution of the popular Japanese print from the late 1800s to present; the adaptation of western styles—naturalism and abstraction—into Japanese styles, methods and aesthetics; and, the dynamics of the family tradition in its commercial, stylistic, and interpersonal dimensions. The Yoshida family is fascinating because of the longevity and breadth of the family’s artistic legacy, its high aesthetic standards, and its internationalism. Thus, this exhibition allows for multiple foci, including aesthetics, production, culture, politics, and personalities.",

Tzedekah is the Jewish commandment to provide for those that are less fortunate as a means of bringing justice to the world. Tzedekah boxes come in all shapes in sizes thereby offering unlimited opportunities for artists to interpret them. The project will send an invitation to local Jewish and non-Jewish artists, inviting them to create a tzedekah box. Approximately 30 winning designs will be displayed at community sites and culminate with an exhibition at The Minneapolis Institute of Arts. The Tzedekah Box Project will challenge viewers/participants to question their own place in society; their responsibilities to their community; and their ability to be social change agents. It will ask us to reflect on ways in which we could have been changed by philanthropy and ways in which our community may have been transformed by another’s generosity.",

Both artists have experienced profound events with the physical body and consider making art to be a transcendent action. Through their work they seek to create an antidote to a high speed, high-tech world that operates beyond human pace. Their exhibition \"High Touch\", which features Stack's luminous black and white drawings and Sugnet's intimate mixed-media installations, offers a poetic investigation into the very essence of things. Here we find slow amassed time, things becoming and unbecoming, traces of touch, and tender constellations of forms. In both bodies of work, primordial forms emerge - forms that suggest seeds, cones, spirals, cells dividing, or the cosmos. These shapes are familiar and there is comfort in that re-cognition. Yet they are located in mysterious spaces and for that they do not feel didactic but more like déjà vu - that fleeting sense of knowing, shrouded in mystery. It seems that you've been here before - perhaps in another life, perhaps as a cell or a star.",

Dating from the late-nineteenth century, the photographs were made by professional photographers for tourists who flocked to Egypt on their “Grande Tour.” The exhibition consists of about fifty albumen prints by a half dozen photographers, including Felice Beato, Felix Bonfils, and Francis Frith. The work is drawn entirely from the Institute’s permanent collection and compliments the concurrent exhibition “Eternal Egypt.”",

Yet all three broker serious ideas that, due to their cultural (or counter-cultural) underpinnings, can seem cautionary, subversive or even sinister. \r\nMollie Rabiner invites the gallery visitor to try their luck with relationships and candy-coated desires by playing her stage-set, coin operated, carnival claw and digger machine. J.J. Peet presents a curious array of fake objects designed to carry extreme value or that allude to some secret information or event.  He questions the very nature of art through an assortment of found and handmade props -- bags of money; bricks of gold; a count-down-clock; and a mysterious brief case. Don Myhre presents a weird robotic amalgamation in his interactive sculpture, “Raft”. In it he combines a fiberglass jet ski, a downloaded landscape cast in foam, and a tattered taxidermied jackrabbit to create a whacked-out reference to the madness of American comodification.",

The four periods into which ancient Egyptian history is divided – the Old Kingdom, the Middle Kingdom, the New Kingdom, and the Late Period –form the underlying structure of the exhibition.

Beginning about six years ago, the Daytons began to focus their donations in the area of Chinese art. Since that time, over 600 objects have been acquired in the categories of Chinese painting, Sung dynasty ceramics, Chinese lacquer, Chinese scholar items, classical Chinese furniture, Chinese woodblock printed hooks, Buddhist sculpture, Chinese archaeological objects, and Tibetan art. The unparalleled generosity of the Dayton’s has allowed the museum to build one of the finest overall collections of Chinese art in the west, and much of it will be shown for the first time during this exhibition.\r\nA brochure of the exhibit is planned and a handbook of Chinese art featuring around 200 of these new works will be available during the final month of the exhibit in time for a symposium planned on the arts of China.",

During an 11-month expedition that began in Alexandria, Egypt in 1838, Roberts produced hundreds of detailed sketches, drawings and watercolors of the region’s rich historical bounty, perceptively capturing its natural beauty and picturesque grandeur. This installation of David Roberts’ magnificent views of the Middle East was organized to complement the forthcoming exhibition “Eternal Egypt: Masterworks of Ancient Art from the British Museum.” The 20 prints on view are selected from the museum’s permanent collection as well as several private collections, including the Hennepin Avenue United Methodist Church in Minneapolis.",

As an etcher, Whistler took inspiration from Rembrandt and the Dutch masters that he discovered in the print collection of his brother in law, Francis Seymour Haden. Works by these artists were on view, allowing the visitor to see the path of Whistler's development as a printmaker. Whistler was a charismatic and challenging personality whose art and ideas influenced numerous other artists. This exhibition also included works by those who were members of Whistler's circle of admirers and followers, allowing the visitor to see the wide path Whistler cut across the art world. His influence was not only seen in the prints and paintings of the day, but also in the interiors and decorative arts his gathered around him. The exhibition was augmented by a selection of decorative arts, Japanese prints, and other objects that would have graced a Whisterian interior. The exhibition cut across numerous curatorial departments to create a stunning picture of the world of James Abbott McNeill Whistler.",

By 1940 their lively pots of Virginia clay won awards at the prestigious Ceramic National at Syracuse, New York. As a result, Ed was offered a teaching position at the University of New Hampshire, where he and Mary produced hundreds of beautifully potted wares often decorated with Ed’s expressive human figures or abstract sgraffito decoration. In the late 1960s, the Scheiers’ move to Mexico resulted in exciting work in new media including weaving design and wooden sculpture. After the Scheiers settled in Arizona in 1978, Ed returned with renewed vigor to clay and has over the past several years created original computer art. This exhibition, celebrated the wealth of work by the Scheiers in local public and private collections, included approximately forty-five ceramic pieces, as well as other objects in a variety of media from their 60-plus years as a creative team.",

The work of Sèvres, Jean Puiforcat, René Lalique, Boch Fréres, Robert Mallet-Stevens, La Maison Desny and Edgar Brandt were among twenty-five select pieces — haute and nouvelle — documenting Art Deco's diverse phases, from the classical-elegant, to the exotic-expressive, and ultimately, to the austere-moderne.",

    "exhibition_description": "This exhibition featured more than thirty of the Chinese paintings acquired in recent years through the generosity of Joan Wurtele. The exhibit included small, lyrical landscapes and bird and flower paintings of the Southern Sung dynasty (1127–1279); delicate ink landscapes of the important early Ming (1368–1644); as well as work by Wu school artists, and some fine Buddhist paintings. Also included were representative professional and literati landscape paintings of the late Ming and Ch’ing dynasties (1644–1911), including works by Ku I-te (active 1608–33), Cha Shih-piao (1615–98), Kung Hsien (1619–89), and Lan Ying (1585-1664). Each of these paintings was selected with the museum’s collecting needs in mind. Care was taken to add significant scrolls that helped achieve our goal of building as representative and high quality a collection of Chinese paintings as possible.",

His latest virtual installation was entitled \"Grotto\", an interactive environment that immersed the viewer and responded to his or her passage through it. The interactivity of Klaila's 21st century landscape paid homage to the intelligence of the living landscape and reflected Klaila's dynamic experience with the world. \r\nTo create the environment, Klaila employed three different computers, a pressure sensitive floor (grid) and modified video game software that synchronizes layered scenes and projected graphic displays. As the viewer stepped into Klaila's Grotto the floor grid sent a signal to the computers telling them where the viewer was and how much pressure was present. The floor graphic read like water on the floor of a cave. Each step sent the water splashing and rippling to reflect off of the walls of the cave.",

But, have you ever seen a Hollywood Liquefier, a toaster with a built-in conveyer belt, a “Coffee X” cold water extractor, a rotating “Twin-O-Matic” waffle iron, a “Top-O-Stove” potato baker, or our newest acquisition, a muscle-bound meat slicer, the pride of the pantry?\r\n \r\nThe third exhibition in the Institute’s “Case Studies in Design” series is devoted to modernist kitchenware.  Ingenuity is often synonymous with modernity and such is the case with nearly forty works selected for this exhibition. Are you aware that one of the foremost designers represented in the exhibition, Harold Van Doren, served as Assistant Director of The Minneapolis Institute of Arts?\r\n \r\nComprised of kitchenware drawn from the Institute’s collection, complemented with additional loans, the works are inventive collaborations between designers, engineers, manufacturers and advertising agents resulting in some of the most remarkable utensils and appliances of the era.  The one element missing is the aroma of freshly-brewed coffee, pancakes, maple syrup and crisp bacon.  Nevertheless, it is an exhibition for all ages, homemakers or not.",

Turner were active participants in this movement that valued imagination, emotion, exotic cultures, nature, and the literature of Byron, Scott, and Shakespeare. These and other related themes were explored in the works on display. The Romantic era stretched from the French Revolution in 1789 until the middle of the 19th  century, with the most intense period of production beginning with the demise of Napoleon in 1815 and progressing until the early 1840s. While many of the artists represented in the exhibition are better known as painters, this exhibition revealed that they were also talented practitioners of lithography and etching.  Featured prints included selections from Gericault’s English Set, J.M.W. Turner’s Liber Studiorum, and Bonnington’s views of Paris and Rouen, as well as Delacroix’s Royal Tiger.",

    "exhibition_description": "How have Americans become aware of who designs their everyday objects? With the advent of industrial production in the mid-19th century, household goods flooded European and American homes, but they were for the most part unattractive, owing to the little regard manufacturers gave toward their appearance. The 1930s introduced Americans to industrial designers such as Raymond Loewy, Henry Dreyfuss, and Walter Dorwin Teague, who became well known through their streamlined approach to everything from automobiles to thermostats, and through their books on the subject of design. By the 1940s, as consumers began to embrace modern design, manufacturers made a point of marketing goods under the “brand names”of their designers. Russel and Mary Wright and Charles and Ray Eames positioned themselves as practitioners of a new, casual lifestyle for which their modern products were perfectly suited. Today, with the faces and signatures of Philippe Starck and Michael Graves prominently featured on packaging, designers are often better known than their merchandise. Through objects from the Institute’s collection and from private collections, “Household Names”examines the designer’s rise to recognition in modern Ameerica.",

Stuart painted nearly 1,000 portraits in his lifetime including Paul Revere, Abigail Adams, Mohawk Chief Joseph Brandt as well as George Washington and numerous other U.S. presidents.

    "exhibition_description": "Artists Richard Shelton and Piotr Szyhalski collaborated for the first time to create an interactive installation called P.R.S.S. for the Minnesota Artists Exhibition Program. P.R.S.S. was inspired by the artists' fascination with the radical investigations of John C. Lilly, Stanley Milgram, Kasimir Malevich, and Ivan P. Pavlov. The exhibition dealt with essential aspects of contemporary human behavior by reflecting on particular dynamics of learning, perception, moral position, resistance, and the disconnections among us all. The P.R.S.S. installation was composed of four chambers in which the viewer experienced a series of virtual images and sounds and participated in their alteration. It was the artists' intention that a range of visceral, emotional, and spiritual responses be experienced through a non-linear installation.\r\n\r\nP.R.S.S. was inspired by the artists' independent studies: Shelton was fascinated with the neural research of Lilly, a scientist obsessed with dolphins, LSD, and with his own self-inflicted isolation experiments; and with Milgram, who is known for his obedience (shock) experiments, performed after the Nuremberg trials, and for the famous theory that no one is more that six degrees removed from anyone else. Szyhalski focused on the Suprematist painting of Malevich, who stripped his art down to its very essence (a black square), and Pavlov, a scientist famous for his research with the conditioned reflex of dogs. P.R.S.S. is not intended to pay homage to these four historical figures, but rather to reflect some of the principles of their work.\r\n\r\nEach artist created two of the four chambers. Piotr Szyhalski's first chamber set up a situation in which things happen while the viewer holds still. In Szyhalski's second chamber he set out to create a pure state of emotion, looking directly at the violence that humans inflict on each other. Richard Shelton's chambers referenced Lilly's work with dolphins and Milgram's infamous shock experiments. In his first chamber, a virtual dolphin talked to th",

The exhibit provides the viewer a fascinating look at some of the personalities, intriguing iconography, and refined sculpting techniques of classical antiquity that are not available in the museum’s permanent collection of Roman sculpture. This thematic exhibit appeals tremendously to scholars and students of Roman art and anyone interested in classical history and art.

Currents of Change will explore the fine and decorative arts along the river during that period. America was undergoing extraordinary changes: from the steamboat era to the advent of the railroad, from a mostly agrarian economy to the beginnings of the industrial revolution, from a nation of youthful optimism to one which would soon erupt into civil war. Fortunes made from lumber and lead processing in the North and cotton and sugar production in the South gave birth to the great cities along the river that we know today, and financed the demand for sophisticated furnishings and a “refined” life. The Mississippi, which had long been a channel for trade, was becoming an important conduit for ideas about art, culture, and design.\r\nCurrents of Change brings together approximately 175 objects in all media: paintings, prints, and drawings, furniture, silver, ceramics, textiles, and sculpture. The exhibition includes a 16-foot segment from the only extant panorama of the Mississippi River (a 340-foot-long moving landscape), to be shown in a theatrical setting that recalls how viewers of the 1850s would have seen it.\r\nAn illustrated catalogue accompanies the exhibition.",

While his pursuit of art began in his native Knoxville, Tennessee, and continued over a five-year period in Boston, the years that followed (1929-1979) were the most innovative and productive of the artist’s life. His career is generally broken into two parts: the New York Years (1929-1953), during which time Delaney produced his colorful and highly-engaging compositions of the City’s urban landscape; and the Paris years (1953-1979) when the artist, known as “the dean of American Negro painters” in Paris, embraced abstract expressionism in a study of color and light. The Institute’s presentation, for the first time, provides a survey of the progression of his work. The exhibition brings forth transitional works that have not previously been considered and illuminate his place within American art history.

    "exhibition_description": "Packages of all sorts have come a long way since the plain brown bundles depicted in Victorian Christmas scenes. Advances in construction, printing, and mechanization throughout the 20th century have resulted in “graphic” developments for the simple shopping bag and hatbox.  They serves as portable billboards for the store, and once home, can live on as containers for keepsakes—often becoming keepsakes themselves. As department stores and boutiques increasingly consider packaging as an extension of their service and identity, they look to designers for more attractive wrappings. Artists such as Erté, Roy Lichtenstein, Salvador Dali, Andy Warhol, and Frank Stella have accepted commissions to design shopping bags, many of them considered portable art by museums and collectors.  \r\nIn the Twin Cities, such fashion-forward retailers as Young-Quinlan, Field-Schlick, and Dayton’s invested considerable effort and imagination into their packaging. The Institute will feature these and other designs from local shops in the Bell Decorative Arts Court during this year’s Holiday Traditions exhibition, on view in the Period Rooms and at the Purcell-Cutts house November 26, 2004 through January 2, 2005. Costumed docents will offer tours from Thanksgiving through New Year’s Eve.",

Their works show books as purveyors of popular culture, objects of physical beauty, vessels of information, and symbols of human knowledge. The exhibition consists of about 60 photographs and one installation by: Sally Alatalo, Peter Beard, James Henkel, Doug Keyes, Abelaredo Morell, Alison Rossiter, and JoAnn Verburg.",

Now a community activist and Representative in the Minnesota State Legislature, Cy Thao was born in Laos in 1972. His family spent the first two years of his life trying to escape the war and the next five starving in a refugee camp. Thao’s family came to Minnesota in 1980.",

The fifteenth-century Netherlandish painter—so named for the delicately patterned and crisply executed blades of grass and plants that resemble embroidery in his paintings—is best known for his panel paintings of the Virgin and Child with a book. Virtually identical in composition, these works feature Mary in voluminous robes sitting on a throne while the Christ child in her arms leafs precociously through the pages of an illuminated manuscript. The Master’s panels differ in their settings and other decorative details, however. Some feature landscape backgrounds while others show city streets. Angels, peacocks, or contemporary burghers embellish the pictures alternatively. Rich in palette and pattern, the panels are finely painted with an eye for detail characteristic of Northern Renaissance painters of this era, which include Rogier van der Weyden (c. 1399-1464), upon whose works the Master’s are based. An illustrated catalogue will be published on the occasion of the exhibition.",

    "exhibition_description": "\"I just want to say one word to you.  Just one word....Plastics....  There's a great future in plastics.\" This brief pronouncement appearing in the 1968 film, \"The Graduate,\" convulsed audiences then, but since has taken on an entirely new meaning. In the span of some 35 years, the entire spectrum of plastics — that \"miracle material\" — has risen from ridicule to respect (occasionally reverence) and, yet again, a scourge-like contempt when it comes to matters of biodegradable disposal.\r\nIn a two-part examination and celebration of innovative plastic design, a first installment will appear in Wells Fargo Gallery of The Minneapolis Institute of Arts followed by a second, overlapping presentation at Wells Fargo Center in downtown Minneapolis. It is the first such arrangement utilizing the city-center facility to expand on a given theme originating at the Institute.\r\nToday, nothing underscores the technological revolution more than plastics. Not since the early 20-century popularity of Bakelite (which will be featured in a simultaneous Institute installation as part of the on-going \"Case Studies\" Series) has plastic been so admired. Tutti-frutti colors, sensuous, tactile surfaces, transparent forms, groovy fusions of art and chemistry, and phenomenal tensile strength are but a few of the qualities fulfilling design needs beyond mere function. In the 21st century, functionality has become multi-dimensional and plastics appear to promise ever-expanding purpose and pleasure.",

    "exhibition_description": "An extensive suite of dramatic jazz posters by the Swiss graphic designer, Niklaus Troxler, will be presented in the U.S. Bank Gallery. Drawn from a collection of post-war posters acquired by Norwest Corporation in 1991, they exemplify the celebrated Swiss International Style initiated decades earlier. Thelonious Monk, McCoy Tyner, Alvin Jones, Arthur Blythe, the Roscoe Mitchell Quartet and Sam Rivers Quartet are but a few of the influential jazz musicians represented. \r\nNiklaus Troxler (b. 1947) is best known for his striking posters for the Jazz festival at Willisau, Switzerland. He studied at the Kunstgewerbeschule, Lucerne (1968-71) and worked briefly as art director at Hollenstein Creation in Paris before founding his own studio in Willisau in 1973. Troxler has been the recipient of numerous design awards, but his work to date is little known in America.\r\nIn their small hometown of Willisau, Troxler and his brother founded a jazz festival in 1975 which soon became world famous. Ever since, Troxler has remained the most prolific and talented of jazz posters artists. While there have been many jazz festivals over the years, none have produced a series of graphics that compare with Troxler’s memorable design. He continues to work in a select field he’s made his own.\r\nPictorial simplicity, bold color fields, rational order, compressed spatial compositions and innovative letterforms are among the qualities that distinguish this group of jazz posters. Clarity and immediacy are the two key ingredients conveyed in multilingual formats meant to transcend language and cultural barriers.\r\nThe Swiss poster movement had a decisive impact on postwar American graphic design, spreading a new “internationalism” in the print world. This cohesive set of posters represents a convergence of two distinct sensibilities: American improvisational jazz and the cerebral order of Swiss graphic design.",

    "exhibition_description": "While plastic is considered a \"now\" medium, the modern plastics industry stretches back to the 1920s and the mass production of Bakelite. Its potential was first developed in 1907 by Dr. Leo Hendrik Baekeland (1863-1944), now regarded as the \"Father of Plastics.\" As a simultaneous complement to the Institute's \"Just One Word: PLASTICS\" exhibition, \"Bakelite: Art Through Chemistry\" will be on view concurrently, from March 6 to February 27, 2005. The latter is a continuation of the museum's \"Case Studies in Design\" series.  \r\nSignificantly, Bakelite has earned the distinction of being the world's very first totally synthetic, thermosetting plastic.  It quickly found its way into homes and offices in a wide assortment of objects, many represented in this exhibition, ranging from kitchenware, household and office wares, to electronics, cameras, tools and jewelry. \"Its versatility extended from cradle to grave\" boasted advertisements in 1939.\r\nMolten Bakelite flowed evenly and gave rise to the smooth, \"streamline\" style so pervasive in the l930s.  At that time the ideological thrust of Modernism stressed the importance of new materials such as Bakelite and, in turn, plastics became firmly associated with the ideals and spread of modern design.",

Many of the pages in these laboriously hand-written books were illuminated - literally \"lighted up\" - with miniature scenes and elaborate initials, painted in bright colors and gilded with gold and precious metals.  Preserved in closed volumes for centuries, illuminated manuscripts remain fresh and vivid examples of medieval artistic techniques.",

    "exhibition_description": "Villa America: American Moderns, 1900-1950, organized by Elizabeth Armstrong, Orange County Museum of Art Deputy Director for Programs and Chief Curator, is drawn from the collection of Curtis Galleries, Inc., founder Myron Kunin, and will present over 85 paintings and sculptures from this collection to the public for the first time. The exhibition begins with a look at key American modernists working in Europe and New York during the first quarter of the 20th century. In these early years, artists such as Stuart Davis, Charles Demuth, Arthur Dove, Marsden Hartley, Gerald Murphy, and Georgia O'Keeffe, to name just a few, were reshaping our view of American art. In the early 1900s many of these artists traveled abroad, where they embraced experimentation to transform traditional subject matter into avant-garde statements of personal expression. After World War I, as New York began to eclipse Europe as the destination for creative people, American artists returned, and many artists from abroad moved to New York. \r\nThis extended period of artistic innovation largely came to an end in the 1930s, after the stock market crash, followed by a more sober, realistic mode, with themes reflecting regional values and a new sense of social responsibility. Artists such as Romare Bearden, Paul Cadmus, Philip Evergood, Philip Guston, Reginald Marsh, and Ben Shahn celebrated an 'American Scene' creating powerful images of everyday American life. In the 1930s and 1940s American Regionalists John Curry and Grant Wood championed a nationalistic art that celebrated agrarian values and the search for American roots. George Ault, Charles Sheeler, and Niles Spencer, among others, returned to a form of classical realism to celebrate the American landscape in their paintings of the period.\r\nIn addition to offering a chronological overview of American modern art, Villa America will also include a selection of major figurative works by such American masters as Milton Avery, Robert Henri, Walt Kuhn, and Andrew Wyeth.

A concoction of spirits, citrus, spices, sugar, and water, punch was made in hundreds of variations on this basic recipe.  From state dinners to tavern gatherings, it was the libation of choice for special occasions-particularly during the holidays.  As it grew in popularity, so too did its specialized bowls, ladles, cups, glasses, and mugs made of ceramic, silver, or glass.  The Institute will feature punch bowls from the 18th-20th centuries in the Bell Decorative Arts Court during this year’s Holiday Traditions exhibition, on view in the Period Rooms and at the Purcell-Cutts.  Costumed docents will offer tours from Thanksgiving through New Year’s. ",

    "exhibition_description": "The tiger figures prominently in Asian mythology, where it is identified with yin, the female principle, as well as autumn, wind, and the west. Artists often paired images of tigers with their cosmological cousin, the dragon (identified with yang, the male principle, spring, rain, and the east). Although tigers are not indigenous to Japan, their absence engendered great interest in them and spurred fanciful ideas about their nature and physical form. The earliest Japanese images of tigers date to as early as the 6th century, but the subject became a staple theme of artists from the 13th century onwards. Some artists pictured ferocious beasts in windswept bamboo; others rendered tigers as overgrown housecats.  This exhibition explores the great breadth of tiger painting through the fertile imaginations of twenty-one Japanese artists. \r\nFrom 1959 until 1964, Edson Spencer was Far East regional manager for Honeywell International in Tokyo. While in Japan, both he and his wife, Harriet, became enamored with Japanese art and amassed an important collection of folk painting. This collection was featured in the museum’s 1994 exhibition Øtsu-e: Japanese Folk Paintings. \r\nBorn in the “year of the tiger” Edson Spencer purchased his first tiger painting while living in Japan. Since then, his collection has grown to include 21 hanging scrolls and a magnificent pair of folding screens. Artists include many of Japan’s most famous painters of the last three hundred years, including Tawaraya Sotatsu, Maruyama Okyo, Nagasawa Rosetsu, Kano Tsunenobu, and Kishi Ganku",

By streamlining production and adapting to the latest fashions, Boston craftsmen produced desirable goods that were less expensive than their English counterparts. Until the mid 18th century, Boston exported more chairs to the American colonies than New York, Philadelphia, or even England.  So prevalent were chairs imported from Boston, that other cities advertised their own version of the so-called “Boston chair.”  Select chairs dating from the 1700s to the 1950s will survey the impressive heritage of Boston seating furniture.",

Its purpose is to provide a forum for examining the dramatic convergence of diverse media in the 20th century.

Classically trained in Chinese ink painting, Yang’s earliest influences include the mythology and philosophy of his homeland China; and later, the visions of modern western masters such as Picasso and Marini. Yang’s figurative images express the wholeness of his experience with nature, creating mystical atmospheres and places “where the viewer has never been before.” Very Taoist in their sensibility, Yang’s paintings are occupied with mysterious animals and humans, who defy any singular narrative. Yang suggests that animals see us far better than we see ourselves, and considers their wisdom (and our blindness to it) to be very significa.nt things",

Kaniess brings all – over abstraction squarely into the 21st century through images that he draws and paints on used record albums and expanses of billboard vinyl.

    "exhibition_description": "Creative photographers have great latitude when printing their work from their negatives.  They choose paper type and size, they can crop the picture differently, and they can alter the tones and contrast of the image, to name only a few options.  Photographers use such techniques to maximize their creative impulse and best convey their message.  But, over time, many photographic artists interpret a particular negative in different ways, challenging their viewers to become connoisseurs.  Only by seeing prints from the same negative, side by side, can one fully appreciate their differences and, perhaps, choose the most fully realized object.  Among the most striking examples are prints of vastly different sizes, silver prints and photogravures of the same image, and vintage versus modern prints. This exhibition, drawn almost entirely from the Institute's permanent collection, will include about 80 photographs, spanning the entire twentieth century.  Among those represented are Ansel Adams, Walker Evans, Lee Friedlander, Gertrude Kasebier, Alfred Stieglitz, and Edward Weston.",

His company was among the first to produce cloth to compliment the architects who championed the Modernist Movement. He then moved forward to enhance the refined aesthetic of the last part of the century through the use of natural as well as synthetic fibers and a variety of technical innovations. This gallery is dedicated to the display of materials from the Jack Lenor Larsen Company Archive that was acquired by the museum in 1999. The acquisition was particularly noteworthy because for five decades the company was renowned for its international leadership in the field of contemporary interiors textiles. Selections from the company’s production lines have been the subject of numerous museum exhibitions from Boston’s Museum of Fine Arts to the Louvre’s museum of decorative arts in Paris. With the MIA’s holding of the entire achieve we are able to examine the material in greater depth than has been possible in the past and share with the museum visitor new insights as well as showing pieces that never went into formal production.\r\nDrawing on the company archive of almost 4000 pieces this series of four rotations focuses on the function of the design studio and the roll of four designers whose distinctive talents played a major roll in the company’s aesthetic development. Two of these designers, Mark Pollack and Lori Witzner now head their own companies and the rotations highlighting their contributions to the Larsen Design Studio will also include pieces from their current work.",

The Near and Far East, India, Angor, Nepal, Bénarès, Cambodia, Shaanxi, China, the Soviet Union, North and South Vietnam, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Alaska, the U.S., Mexico, and his native country France.

He was one of the first western photographers permitted to enter China since the 1949 Cultural Revolution. Highly sensitive to the nuances and subtleties of cultural variations, his photographs provide insightful and memorable vignettes of our rich, complex, and diverse world. He has twice won the coveted Overseas Press Club Award (1967 and again in 1971). This is a retrospective spanning the illustrious career of one of the great French photojournalist of the 20th century.

However the Larsen design studio has never been limited by stereotypes and in the mid 60’s they created a line of clothing fabric under the JaeL label of dramatic prints on a synthetic knit, the new wonder fabric of that decade.  Colors were often bright and demanded attention while patterns ranged from abstract to figural repetitions of exotic birds and animals such as tigers and leopards.  The JaeL line received considerable acclaim but production demands in the fashion world differed so greatly from the creation of interiors fabrics, which were the focus of the company, that the line was discontinued after 3 years. Buried within the company’s archives, these textiles have not been seen for decades and it is the first time they have been highlighted in a museum. ",

As of trying to be children one last time, young, adolescent girls swing from trees, take rides in rickety boats and fearlessly test the boundaries of their last Indian Summer. The spectacle of their enthusiasm is designed to seduce he viewer while reflecting back the illusion inherent in the adult recalling of childhood. Idyllic landscapes offer a vision of a Shangri-la that never was or could be.",

As a painter, Munoz speaks to disconnection in epic terms, making a powerful case for the transformation of human consciousness. His paintings are apocalyptic in the most dynamic sense—in Munoz’s world revelation can serve as an alchemical flashpoint. His colossal cataclysmic images provoke the viewer into a rethinking about daily practice. Combining the diverse influences of Giotto, Velasquez and Chaim Soutine, Munoz's paintings mix spirituality with irreverence and hope, exploring the dark side in order to see the light.",

    "exhibition_description": "Alexander Calder is a ubiquitous presence in the story of modern art, and yet he is rarely seen in the context from which he initially emerged as an artist. His artistic parentage consisted of Marcel Duchamp, who provided the name of and concept for the mobile, Mondrian who introduced pure abstraction to him, and Miró who communicated the central thesis of Surrealism. “The Surreal Calder,” consisting of seventy works including thirteen paintings and objects by artists other than Calder, will put Calder back in the midst of Surrealism so that his achievement is more profoundly understood within that context. The exhibition is conceived of as a suite of six distinct galleries. The first gallery will include works by Miró, Max Ernst, Yves Tanguy, René Magritte and will delineate the Surrealist milieu and its chief aspects. In the following galleries themes will explore Calder’s relationship to that milieu during his early years, culminating in 1947 with the theoretical end date of Surrealism. Those works show Calder’s wit, caricature, and linear flights of fancy, his ‘marvelous,’ in the Surrealist sense of that word, personages – fantastic, never before seen, creatures, poetic constructions of unlikely materials, biomorphic forms from an imaginary vision of nature and Calder’s constellations; apparent views of celestial space. The film “Calder’s Circus” runs continuously in a gallery inside the exhibition. Made in 1961, this 19-minute color film shows Alexander Calder at work.  A fully illustrated catalogue accompanies the exhibition.",

    "exhibition_description": "The Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art is internationally renowned for the quality, rarity, and beauty of its European painting collection. Perhaps the most famous aspect is the concentration of Italian Baroque masterpieces. The museum’s distinguished director in the 1930s and 40s, Chick Austin, began this collection when such works were out of fashion and was able to acquire notable examples by Strozzi, Luca Giordano, and the first authentic Caravaggio in an American museum - - The Ecstasy of St. Francis. Spanish and Northern paintings of the 17th century also were acquired including the great Claude and unusual works of Sweets. Austin’s successor, Charles Cunningham, built on this foundation and added some of the collection’s most notable baroque and rococo treasures by Frans Hals, Zurbaran, and Panini. In more recent times examples by Vouet, Cigoli, Cuyp, and Valerio Castello were added to the collection. This exhibition will present approximately 60 masterpieces spanning the 15th through the 18th centuries; beginning with such Renaissance masters as Piero di Cosimo and Sebastiano del Piombo continuing with the finest examples of Baroque painting, and culminate in rococo splendor with Tiepolo, Canaletto, Guardi, Melendez, Greuze and Goya.

    "exhibition_description": "Inspired by the acquisition of the aerodynamic 1936-designed Tatra T87 automobile, the eighteenth consecutive modernist exhibition at Wells Fargo Center is devoted to streamline design.  In the 1930s, the essence of time and speed were exemplified in a body of work that embraced industrial design, new synthetic materials, worship of the machine and the cult of the future.  The advent of the teardrop form, the sexy, windswept, contour, speed lines and sleek, shiny surfaces are manifested in an array of imaginative concoctions that convey a residue of charm and innocence.\r\nThe exhibition is comprised of works drawn from the Institute’s extensive Modernism collection in which superstar designers such as Norman Bel Geddes, Kem Weber, Henry Dreyfuss, Raymond Loewy — among many unheralded but equally talented designers — are represented.  The streamline aesthetic remains one of the most enduring episodes of the 20th-century, characterized by panache and energy.  Little wonder there is a widespread resurgence of interest in this fascinating chapter of design.",

    "exhibition_description": "During his lifetime, Sir Francis Seymour Haden (1818-1910) was better known as a surgeon than as an artist.   It was considered proper for a 19th century English gentleman to learn how to draw and to collect art, but more as an avocation than as a profession.  Haden pursued his medical training in London and Paris and eventually came to specialize in obstetrics.  His private practice was successful enough to allow him to acquire a significant collection of old master prints, a well-appointed London home, and a country manor house, and to travel frequently throughout England and the rest of Europe.  It was during these holidays that Haden turned to etching and to his favorite subject, the landscape and the eternal beauty of nature.  \r\nWhile a medical student at the Sorbonne in Paris, Haden took night classes in anatomical drawing at the École des Beaux-Arts \"to train his powers of observation\" and to improve his surgical skills.  In 1844, on a trip though Italy, he etched his first copper plate.   Haden returned to the medium in 1857, and, because he was convinced that etching was an art form equal to painting, he founded the Royal society of Painter-Etchers.  He also authored several art books including The Etched Work of Rembrandt (1879) and was knighted for his artistic accomplishments by Queen Victoria in 1894.\r\nDespite the vital role he played in the graphic arts, Haden never considered himself a professional artist.  He was an amateur in the best sense of the work, and left behind an important legacy of etched works and writings.  The 31 Haden prints in this exhibition were selected from more than 250 of his etchings, drypoints, and mezzotints held in the Department of Prints and Drawings at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts.

This large format limited edition artist’s book features twenty brilliantly colored pochoir (stencil) prints and an extensive lithographed text reproduced from the artist’s handwritten original. In the early 1940s, while recuperating from a serious illness, Matisse found himself unable to paint and began to work in a technique he had devised years earlier as a way to develop ideas for his paintings and design projects. Known as papier découpée, or paper cutouts, the technique involved the cutting and collaging of hand-painted paper into two-dimensional designs. He called his work “drawing with scissors.”  Matisse, who often drew inspiration from music and dance, once described the series of designs he created for Jazz as \"chromatic and rhythmic improvisations\" and noted that the subjects, “with their lively and violent tones, derive from crystallizations of memories of circuses, folktales and voyages.”",

In some examples, the overt moralistic message is tempered with erotic overtones. \r\nThe works in this exhibition were made by Italian, German, French, Dutch and Flemish artists at a time when printmaking became a common art form.

Illustrations of The Book of Job, first published in London in 1825, ranks among Blake's best-known and most enduring achievements. This masterwork of the engraver's art comprises 21 line engravings and an engraved title page; each plate is accompanied by text that Blake selected from Job and other books of the Bible.\r\nThe Book of Job, one of the books of the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament), recounts the trials and eventual spiritual awakening of Job, a virtuous and wealthy citizen of Uz. The biblical text was written as a didactic poem framed by a prose prologue and epilogue. Intended as a challenge to the belief that misfortunes are punishment for sin, The Book of Job was for Blake the apotheosis of lyric expression.\r\nTaken as a whole, Blake's engravings are a metaphysical commentary in the form of a symbolic narrative. By Blake's own account, the engravings are not to be read literally, but are rather to be spiritually discerned as conceptions of the artist's personal reading of the Bible. To Blake, Job's spiritual journey paralleled his own creative struggles and spiritual awareness. Completed when the artist was nearly 70 years of age, Illustrations of the Book of Job is the last of Blake's experiments in combining text and image.",

The chance to interpret a favorite text with their own vision is, for many artists, irresistible. The artist’s books exhibited here—spanning more than a century—display a unique commingling of words and picture on the same page, from Pierre Bonnard’s exquisitely daring Parallèlement to Donald Baechler’s quizzical Double Whammy. \r\nThe Minneapolis Institute of Arts is committed to continually strengthening its collection of artist’s books, now numbering more than 600 works housed in the Department of Prints and Drawings. This exhibition presents a selection of recent and important additions to the permanent collection. As these books demonstrate, Greek poetry can provoke an artist’s imagination as readily as a modern-day fairy tale. The artist and author may be friends—like Sonia Delaunay and Jacques Damase—or the artist may take on the dual role of author and illustrator, as Hans Arp and Mark Beard do here.\r\nExciting, experimental, unexpected—the artist’s book format signifies, above all, collaboration between publisher and printer, image and text, high art and craft. The possibilities for expression ensure that all will persist in meeting on the same page for a long time to come.",

From simple protection to profound communication, cloth has been used for centuries to express personal identity and cultural patterns. A new commission inspired by one of the museum’s famous European tapestries, a Colonial American bed hanging and an Art Deco rug are among the objects that tell the story of cloth creating distinctive environments while a variety of costume accessories from South America to South Asia illuminate the importance of personal presentation.\r\nDrawn from the museum’s permanent collection, a number of objects are new acquisitions that have never been on view; a new commissioned “art wear” sculpture by Jon Riis; a 19th century Kashmir shawl; a Turkish embroidered ceremonial napkin; an 18th century embroidered colonial bed curtain and a 20th century Swedish bag made from wood shavings.

It was generally accepted that important visual statements were encoded in large objects, whether they were two dimensional or sculptural.  Cutting edge galleries and public museums displayed paintings and three-dimensional forms that were big.  Artists of the period knew that if they wanted their work seen, it must be expressed in a large scale. Nevertheless a number of individuals did not entirely reject the smaller form.   \r\nThis exhibition examines the large and smaller works of several fiber artists including Sheila Hicks, Olga de Amaral, and Magdalena Abakanowicz, who have produced free standing as well as wall pieces.  The objects communicate that the strength of the message isn’t dependent on the size of the object.",

One section is presented at Wells Fargo Center and the other is incorporated into the Minneapolis Institute of Arts Modernism galleries in the new Target Wing.\r\nPresently, there are more than sixty 20th-century modernist vases in the MIA collection, dating from 1900 to the 1960s, from which the vessels were selected.  Traditionally, a vase is an open container, generally used to display cut or dried flowers, made from unlimited media.  Form and surface vary considerable, from overall applied decoration to unornamented silhouettes in which the natural properties of the medium become the essential ingredient.\r\nThroughout the 20th century, artists continued to push the boundaries of familiar shapes as well as their expressed purpose, increasingly giving way to sculptural works of pure form and color; their function is often a secondary consideration.  Interestingly vases have served as principal transmitters of cultural styles for centuries due to the relative ease by which they can be transported worldwide.",

His life-long fascination with words and language—especially the intersection of the visual and verbal—continues to infuse his work to the present day.\r\nRuscha’s Stains portfolio, produced and published by the artist in 1969, features a series of 75 sheets of white paper, each bearing a single stain from one of a spectrum of common organic materials, including such household products as Vasoline petroleum jelly, tincture merthiolate, and Liquid Drano; food items such as egg yolk, red wine (Chateau Latour 1962), and Hershey’s chocolate syrup; bodily fluids including urine and semen; and such oddities as rose petal (American Beauty) and “ant.” The portfolio is housed in a simple black clamshell case, the interior of which has been marked with one additional stain—the blood of the artist.",

For the estimated 1,000 courtiers who kept rooms at the chateau, a dizzying schedule of amusements was offered each season—fêtes, masquerade balls, outdoor theater performances and concerts, fireworks displays—with no expense spared. Arranging these entertainments and parties was important business, overseen by an official bureaucratic department of the king’s household—called the Menus Plaisirs du Roi—which employed a small army of artists, architects, and craftsmen to execute the elaborate undertakings. \r\n\r\nThe prints in this show, drawn from the permanent collection although many never before exhibited in the museum, capture the splendor of the Ancien Régime—or “Old Regime” as post-Revolutionary France termed the former system of aristocratic rule. Many of the printmakers, Charles Nicolas Cochin II, Jean-Michel Moreau, Jean Le Pautre, were commissioned by the kings to commemorate the most important of these celebrations and fêtes, with a desire to propagate, both at home and abroad, the grandeur of their reigns. Ironically, these widely disseminated images of the frivolity and decadence of courtly life may also have fostered mounting tensions against the royal regime, helping to turn the oppressive system on its head at the end of the 18th century.",

In addition, pictures of the wilderness played a significant role as symbols of national strength and power.

It told the season and social occasion.  It could provide talismanic protection.  And sometimes, when fashioned for her own use by a woman of a certain skill and temperament, a veil turned community tradition into an expression of personal whimsy.

Her large format, photo-realist paintings are saturated with theatrical lighting and bright colors to emphasize the ominous nature of the situation. Three artists come together for this exhibition to explore issues of military representation in popular culture; the relationship between patriotism and fear and the way war and conflict is brought into our homes. Justin Newhall presents large-format, color photographs of historical battle re-enactments. Megan Vossler creates delicate graphite renderings from public images of marching troops, soldiers and refugees. Camille Gage alters military photographs, reducing the images to their essential and most powerful elements.",

Hiddur Mitzvah’s roots were established when Moses sang, “This is my God and I will glorify Him” (Exodus 15:2).  Such ornamentation of ritual objects is considered an example of Mitzvot, or good deeds.  This exhibition explores the concept of Hiddur Mitzvah by featuring ceremonial objects and textiles from the Minneapolis Institute of Arts and private collections that demonstrate the highest quality in craftsmanship and materials.

Marquette’s sculptures often take on minimalist forms infused with repetitive objects, merging the exhibition space with metal and experimental materials. With an acute interest in ballistics and munitions; neoprene, ballistic gelatin, antifreeze and matches have all played roles in his work. The formal beauty of his sculptures highlights the seductiveness of potentially dangerous materials, beckoning closer examination. By pulling the viewer into his work, Marquette forces us to consider the everyday use of the materials and the technology, science and precision behind them.\r\nMarquette has been creating sculpture and site specific installations around Minnesota and the country for the past ten years.",

From Afghanistan to Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan to Turkmenistan work of individual artists have helped to maintain cultural traditions for millennia, whereas the interdependence of highly skilled urban artists of the Central Asian Khanates often reflect influences from the many foreign interactions that were an integral essence of the Silk Road.

Jim Denomie and Andrea Carlson demonstrate two different perspectives on their shared content of irony, story and politics.\r\nThe exhibition will include an expansion of Denomie’s ''Renegade'' series. Denomie plans to revisit these politically charged and humorous landscapes in order to show further developments in the renegade’s ongoing saga. These paintings will be shown alongside an installation of portraiture from his painting-a-day series. By painting a daily portrait from his imagination, Denomie addresses the self-analytical qualities of painting others. These intense images complement Denomie’s Renegades by telling a different type of story that reads more like a personal diary.\r\nCarlson’s ''Windigo'' and ''Aatisokaanag'' series will also be featured. In her ''Windigo'' series, Calson questions calcified views of authenticity and cultural purity through hybridized imagery. She is also interested in how stories are often ascribed to objects and how these objects become surrogates for cultural exchange. In the ''Aatisokaanag'' series, Carlson has painted her interpretations of the sacred stories. Each image in this series serves as a cross-section of a larger cycle of stories.",

Over a lifetime career in industrial design, Harley initiated hundreds of designs to shape the products his clients were developing for the companies he represented, including those he owned between 1954 and 1986.  “Creativity is practically synonymous with Harley,” wrote the associate editor of the Counselor, a national industry magazine in 1991.  Harley has preserved an extensive archive from which these conceptions have been selected. The sketches resulting from his companies’ drawing boards range from office products, toys, and advertising, to fire hydrants and snow blowers.  As presentation drawings, they are remarkable for the innovative product designs being promoted, and the skilled draftsmanship utilized in glamorizing the individual pieces, all executed with color pencils — the media of the moment before computers took full rein of the design process.  Through the years, Harley’s clients at home and abroad included Honeywell, Toro, Playskool and Hallmark. ",

Trained as a boy in the art of gold-flecked lacquerware, he gained a reputation as a master lacquer artist by reviving techniques long forgotten, and by advancing the field by integrating many new materials into his designs. He first studied painting to improve the decorations he applied to his lacquerware, but he soon became so adept the paintings themselves won high praise. Trained in the naturalistic manner of the Shijo School, Zeshin rejected the slippily executed and formulaic designs of his colleagues and fought to maintain the quality of traditional Japanese craftsmanship. His crowning achievement was to invent a technique that allowed him to paint with lacquer on paper and silk. This installation is the first to examine Zeshin’s work by looking at his dual role as a cultural preservationist and technical innovator.

Bands with roots in blues and folk music improvised and jammed freely, allowed their songs to go on at length, and utilized unusual sounds such as feedback. This music was central to the American counter-culture (“hippie”) movement, spawning freeform dance concerts, flashing light shows, and psychedelic posters. Among the leading groups were Big Brother & the Holding Company (featuring Janis Joplin), Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, and Steve Miller Band.\r\nPhotographers easily integrated themselves into the psychedelic music scene. They made portraits of the musicians in the controlled settings of their studios, captured band members on the streets of the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood (where most of them lived), and photographed the frequent and energetic live performances. A handful of talented photographers made iconic images of the bands that were used in magazines, posters, and on album covers. Prominent among them were Herb Greene, Jim Marshall, Bob Seidemann, and Thomas Weir.",

Her use of this motif stands in contrast to strategies of abstraction adopted by many of her peers, which tended to be Cubist-based, using straight lines and angles rather than curves and circles. Using the circle and its kin-the ellipse, the oval, and the arcing line-O’Keeffe explored the shifting terrain between abstraction and representation, sometimes calling upon such forms to represent a mood, a reaction to a sensation, or the spiritual essence of a subject, while at other times using them to encourage her viewers to see new relationships between familiar objects. As she developed her unique pictorial vision, O’Keeffe looked to a wide variety of sources, ranging from the theories of Arthur Wesley Dow and Wassily Kandinsky to the work of her American peers, Asian art, and contemporary photography, constantly seeking inspiration and new ideas, but consistently integrating what she learned into a visual language that was, finally, a highly personal and thoroughly innovative contribution to American Modernism.\r\nDespite O’Keeffe’s broad popularity and the numerous exhibitions devoted to her work both during her lifetime and posthumously, Georgia O’Keeffe: Circling Around Abstraction is the first exhibition devoted to this aspect of her work, and promises to make an important addition to scholarship on both O’Keeffe and twentieth-century American art.

    "exhibition_description": "River to Infinity - The Vanishing Points is the summation of a series of reflective mirrored landscape installations that present the viewer with visually constructed cultural dualities. The work points to the convergence of manifest destiny, contemporary American environmental values, and the vanishing of the natural world by recognizing the demise of species, peoples, and, through metaphor, society. At the same time, River to Infinity celebrates the excesses and the opalescent beauty of western culture in a fantasia of recontextualization: the work exists as a place of inspiration and horror. At first, the opulence gratifies and distracts the viewer. As time passes, the viewer is reflected in the mirrored surfaces of the installation, triggering an awareness of personal complicity and entrapment in a web of causation. \r\nRiver to Infinity is an entirely reflective landscape containing a mirrored river. On the banks of the river, reflective floral and fauna of endangered and extinct species coexist with fantastic and ambiguous reflective animals borne of recombinant DNA technology. At both end points of the river, separated by its length, video projections of constantly changing American landscapes play on the walls of the space. As the videos are projected, they are reflected on the mirrored surfaces of the river and its sculptural life forms. ",

Some artists have bent the strong tradition of photojournalism to explore more subjective modes of photography and video as overtly interpretive media that extend into social analysis. Others construct elaborate fictions with self-portraiture and performance to create deeply personal, often enigmatic narrative histories. Each has used his or her medium to provide rich insights into the dynamics shaping the contemporary Indian psyche. This exhibition demonstrates the artistic vitality arising from extreme economic and political shifts, the pervasive influence of the media, and the competition between cultural traditions and globalization.

Popular Passion tracts encouraged such meditations by elaborating on Gospel events with wholly invented miseries, designed to intensify people’s empathy for Christ’s suffering. As this exhibition shows, printmakers followed suit, adding new forms of torture, inventive coloring, and other wrenching devices to heighten the drama of Christ’s sacrifice.",

Saarinen’s presence in the Midwest is very strong, with his creation of corporate campuses for General Motors (Technical Center, Warren, Michigan, completed 1956) and IBM (Rochester, Minnesota, completed 1959), as well as churches and campus projects including his collaboration with his famous architect father, Eliel, on Christ Church Lutheran in Minneapolis, Minnesota (1949).  By examining the architect’s entire output of more than 50 built and proposed projects, Eero Saarinen: Shaping the Future will be the first opportunity to understand Saarinen’s collective work in the larger context of postwar modern architecture. It will also address his sculptural furniture, including the famous “Womb” chair Eero designed in 1948 for Knoll. The exhibition will be organized into two sections: “Building for Postwar America,” shown at the MIA will focus on building types, illustrating the wide range of Saarinen’s projects in the context of their cultural and political significance; and “The Architect and his Milieu,” shown at the Walker will examine Saarinen and his many collaborators including designers Charles Eames, and Alexander Girard, and local architect Ralph Rapson.

Numbering about 10,000 photographs, it covers the entire history of the medium, from the mid-nineteenth century to the present day.\r\nThis exhibition features the fifty most salient and fully-realized photographs in the museum’s holdings.  It begins with a 1845 salt print by the English inventor William Henry Fox Talbot and ends with a 2002 color portrait by Alec Soth, from his series “Sleeping by the Mississippi.”  In between, the genres of documentary photography, photo-journalism, and street photography are well represented in the show.  Included are Dorothea Lange’s “Migrant Mother” and Arthur Rothstein’s “Dust Storm,” both iconic images from the Great Depression. Among the most recognizable pictures are Edward Weston’s “Pepper No. 30” (1930) and Ansel Adams’s “Moonrise, Hernandez” (1941).  The names of other photographers represented reads like a who’s who of photography: Berenice Abbott, Diane Arbus, Eugene Atget, Richard Avedon, Walker Evans, Robert Frank, Lee Friedlander, Lewis W. Hine, Man Ray, W. Eugene Smith, Alfred Stieglitz, and Paul Strand.\r\nThis is the first time that the Minneapolis Institute of Arts has presented such a highly-selected grouping of its most important photographs.  The exhibition and its accompanying publication commemorate the significant collecting legacy of Carroll T. (Ted) Hartwell, the founding curator of the department, who died in 2007.  It reveals Mr. Hartwell’s critical eye for singular historical pieces as well as his belief in the influence and vitality of accomplished living photographers.

    "exhibition_description": "The poster medium is inseparably linked to the international Art Nouveau movement through such figures as Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec (1864-1901) and Alphonse Maria Mucha (1860-1939) both prominently featured in this exhibition where graphic design, advertising and art became one.\r\nThe transition from Victorian graphics to L’Art Nouveau style was a gradual one, initiated largely by Jules Cheret (1836-1933) and Eugene Grasset (1841-1917) who were instrumental in the development of the street poster.  A new French law in 1881 permitted the widespread distribution and display of posters, playbills and leaflets on public walls.  Appearing everywhere, they unleashed a booming poster industry.  \r\nDesigners and printers quickly multiplied.  Press runs blossomed, increasing to 200,000 copies.  So too did individual poster sizes.  By 1884 posters measured up to seven feet in length.  At least eight French printers were specializing in posters alone.  The Paris streets became an art gallery for the nation in which the art of color lithography reached its zenith.\r\nMore expedient and timely than other media, posters codified the primary ingredients readily identified with the Art Nouveau moment.  The influence of the Japanese print is clearly evident in Toulouse-Lautrec’s use of flat silhouettes, foreshortening, unmodulated color, and fluid, reportorial imagery inspired by Paris cabaret life.  From 1895 to 1900, the movement found its most comprehensive statement in Mucha’s paperworks.  His dominant theme was a central female figure surrounded by floral arabesques.  His highly stylized hair patterns became a hallmark of the era — Le Style Mucha — seen in his “Job” poster (1898) and the celebrated quartet suite, “Les Fleurs” (1897).\r\nThe Art Nouveau episode led to dramatic changes in the relationship of words and images forever transforming the way we perceive the graphic arts.",

Concepts of cosmopolitanism and worldview are also often encoded into the composition of jewelry, as well as one’s cultural and religious beliefs.  Necklaces are familiar objects but the purpose of this exhibition is to inspire a different approach to thinking about them.  It will also allow the public an opportunity to experience, in a new context, objects from our permanent collection that might be overlooked. Necklaces for this exhibition will be chosen from many world cultures and be made of various materials, including ivory, hair, gold, jade, shell, coral, glass, metal and marble.",

It will be comprised of around fifteen objects, primarily sculptures, taken mainly from the MIA’s collection, that will be shown in various kinds of settings, for example with different sorts of captions, with or without contextual photos, etc. The different settings will explore degrees of accessibility of the objects, amounts of information offered, the use of audio-visual aids, and other “parameters.”\r\nA crucial part of the exhibition will be the reactions – comments, criticism, and suggestions – from the different audiences. The kind of questions to be asked, and the ways in which to respond, will be determined in close association with MIA’s Education and Interactive Media departments.",

He worked from the 1910s through the 1960s, producing ethereal landscapes, modernist still lifes, and sweeping panoramas of the city of Prague.  Every subsequent Czech photographer acknowledged Sudek’s pioneering work and contributed, in their own way, to the rich photographic legacy of their country.  Among them were the modernists Frantisek Drtikol and Jaromir Funke, the surrealist Eva Fuka, and the contemporary figure-photographer Jan Saudek.  These and other individuals working in what is now the Czech Republic created one of the strongest contributions to twentieth-century photography in all of Europe. The exhibition will include approximately 75 photographs drawn entirely from the MIA’s holdings and the local collection of Harry Drake.",

Through repetition, non-linear narratives, and patterns, she creates meditative environments that evaluate time. Constructing landscapes she explores the possibility that there could be genetically transferred memories and behaviors that are rediscovered and found through a methodology of free association. \r\nMyhre’s work is made to prompt memory of witnessed events by building an object to commemorate its importance. They are ‘self made’ souvenirs that authenticate an experience and allow embellishment of specific aspects of each occurrence. Carefully chosen materials, objects and processes make a clear representation, but the resulting piece is usually a nostalgic replica rather than a factually correct object. ",

    "exhibition_description": "The year 2009 marks the 20th annual Modernism exhibition presented at Wells Fargo Center in downtown Minneapolis.  To commemorate the anniversary, Wells Fargo Minnesota has donated a series of twenty Swiss posters — emblematic of the Swiss International Style dating from 1950 -1985 — to the Minneapolis Institute of Arts.\r\nA haven for artists fleeing two world wars, neutral Switzerland formulated a distinct advertising style with special emphasis on the poster format.  Swiss artists had been exposed earlier to the move-ments and styles flourishing elsewhere in Europe, yet it was not until the late twenties that the Swiss poster exemplified a universally recognized signature style.\r\nThe active encouragement of poster design by the Swiss government at national and local levels and the institution of an annual competition to promote it were significant, as were such important journals as Graphis (founded in 1944) and Neue Grafik (New Graphic Design) founded in 1958.  Replete with articles summarizing the major tenets of the Swiss Style, it was responsible for establishing Switzerland’s reputation as the epicenter of modernist typography.  Moreover, the schools of applied arts in Basel and Zurich became internationally important education centers for graphic design.\r\nSwiss designers developed a number of new typefaces in the 1950s, the most popular and celebrated being Helvetica,* a refined version of Akzidenz Grotesk, a 19th-century sans-serif typeface.  Helvetica’s widespread use became integral to the clarity and easy legibility of the Swiss graphic style.  In fact, sans-serif type was the most emblematic component of the International Typographic Style.  In 1954, Adrian Foutiger designed Univers, a mathe-matically constructed and visually programmed font with twenty-one variations.\r\nAmong the younger Swiss designers who emerged in the 1950s through the ’70s as important innovators were: Armin Hofmann (his 1965 book, “Graphic Design Manual,” was a key manifesto of elementary design principles), Tino Steinemann, Car",

The exhibition consists of 64 objects: paintings, drawings, engravings, textiles, photographs as well as some of Hunt’s letters and memorabilia. \r\nThis exhibition looks at the origins of Hunt’s vision, which is rooted in the economic, cultural and spiritual milieu of Victorian England. His concern about contemporary moral and spiritual dilemmas is articulated through works that focus on the theme of spiritual, intellectual, or emotional enlightenment. He is especially interested in moments of insight or revelation, which have the power to change the lives of individuals or the course of the civilized world. The questions that Hunt dealt with in his own times are still relevant today.  This is a Hunt for the 21st century, and audiences are able to see how many of our contemporary dilemmas were ones with which Hunt and his contemporaries struggled.\r\nHunt’s secular themes, particularly those featuring women and the relationship between the sexes, reflect his personal experience and have special resonance for modern audiences. His marriage to his deceased wife's sister, who cared for his motherless son, placed him beyond the pale in Britain where such marriages were illegal. He campaigned successfully for a change in the law but never lived to benefit from it.\r\nHunt’s religious subjects captured the High Victorian imagination, and struck an evangelical chord around the world. His vision was disseminated by means of engravings produced after his paintings. The Light of the World, Hunt’s allegorical painting of Jesus, actually circumnavigated the globe on protracted tours.

    "exhibition_description": "This exhibition consists of 110 of the most outstanding works of art drawn from the Thaw collection of North American Indian art.  The exhibition will reveal the extraordinary range of art produced by Native American cultures.  While the works of art are enormously diversified in type, style, and use of materials, they demonstrate a consistent appreciation of the power of the natural world in human affairs and the universal appeal of beautifully realized works of art. This is also an exhibition about connoisseurship as revealed through the unrivaled eye of one of the foremost and far-ranging art collectors and dealers of our time.  The Eugene and Clare Thaw Collection of North American Indian art comprises more than 800 masterpieces of Native American art from across North America and spanning more than 2000 years.  Mr. Thaw has selected the works in the collection on the basis of their visual impact, superb artistry, and exceptional aesthetic qualities.  The collection reveals, in Mr. Thaw’s words that “To me, American Indian art stands rightfully with Ancient art, with masterpieces of Asia and Europe as their equal.”\r\nThe exhibition will be accompanied by a special installation of videos featuring members of the local Native American community. Organized by Associate Curator of Native American Art Joe D. Horse Capture, each video adds a contemporary Native voice to the mostly historical exhibition. The videos will spotlight the work of: visual artist and curator Carolyn Anderson; Terri Yellowhammer, the Indian Child Welfare Consultant for the State of Minnesota Department of Human Services; playwright and author Rhiana Yazzie; dancer and choreographer Emily Johnson; Perry Flanagan, Director of the Native American Leadership Program, Wellstone Action; and Justin Kii Huenemann, President and CEO of the Native American Community Development Institute.

    "exhibition_description": "The exhibition presents the cream of the Scottish National Gallery’s renowned Venetian paintings collection, including three Titians from the famed Bridgewater collection of the Duke of Sutherland, which have been on loan to the National Gallery since 1945. This is the first time they have been exhibited outside of the gallery.

The pastel images create a surface veneer of innocence and charm that hints at darker truths beneath the surface. Olson’s drawings and sculptures question the human impulse to clean up and arrange nature and their need to immortalize once-living objects. Payne’s oil pastels use narrative elements and line and color to capture awkward moments in life’s pursuits. Sinness uses colored pencil and sculpture is a personal examination of queer domesticity using fable, history and unconfined possibility as visual metaphor.",

    "exhibition_description": "Death has a lot on his calendar. Of course, there is the work of ministering to and menacing his endless stream of more or less willing clients. But, he also has parties to attend, concerts to perform, and places to go. He is an athlete, adept at riding horses, driving chariots, and maneuvering other contraptions that most of us know little about. His musical skills include stringed instruments, percussion, and brass. It comes as no surprise that he is also a gifted dancer. Death also has a practical side, as demonstrated by his mastery of agricultural implements and time pieces. He is unimpeachably democratic in his associations. In fact, it is difficult to think of anyone he would avoid. Many have claimed the title of “The Great Equalizer,” but ever-busy Death retains the crown.\r\nSo compelling is Death that he has been a subject of fascination to artists since the Middle Ages. This exhibition, a complement to “The Mourners: Tomb Sculptures from the Court of Burgundy” (January 23—April 17, 2011), features the flip-side of the human act of mourning as seen by artists ranging from Renaissance master Hans Holbein to Mexican surrealist Rufino Tomayo. Some artists take delight in the dark humor of the netherworld, some shock us with its fearsome aggression, and others find poignancy in its comfort. Some remind us that Death is an unexpected visitor for whom we must prepare; while, others see Death approaching quickly, attracted by our actions.\r\nDespite his busy calendar, Death beckons you. Great artists urge you to accept his invitation—in your imagination for the present—for eventually Death is sure to find you.",

He spent the next twelve years making a series of monumental portraits of Americans, with no special lighting or equipment, only a finely-tuned sense of form and his ability to establish a rapport with his subjects.  By focusing on their penetrating gazes, downcast eyes, or distant stares, he depicts individuals, not types, revealing their “strength and delicacy,” as the distinguished art historian Meyer Schapiro noted.  Placing their faces at the front of the frame, Bergman leaves little room for background distractions while clearing a path toward the recognition of his subjects’ psychological complexities, as well as their remarkable range of emotions.  Viewed together, the photographs form a provocative series that speaks not only of the physical presence of these individuals but also their psychic states. The exhibition of thirty works is the first major presentation of these portraits. ",

    "exhibition_description": "Hayter’s Atelier 17 was seminal for the adventurous printmaking of the mid-20th century. He encouraged artists to try their hand at printmaking, and the studio became a meeting place for the exchange of artistic ideas. Hayter’s stimulus was particularly widespread, for Atelier 17’s 60-year run in Paris (1927 to 1988) was interrupted by a ten-year exile in New York during the 1940s. Moreover, Atelier 17 became a prototype for the collaborative workshops that have played a central role in printmaking over the past several decades. Dennis Jon has selected this presentation of innovative prints by European and American artists who worked with Hayter. The roll includes familiar names, such as Miró, Masson, Arp, Chagall, Lasansky, Nevelson, Nicholson, De Kooning, and Pollock. Others, such as André Racz and Leo Katz will be new to most of our visitors.",

This exhibition takes a look at the meaning of good design though the examination of just one form over the course of more than 300 years – the chair.  From the basic Tudor to Phillippe Starck’s Louis Ghost Armchair for Kartell, we will explore in just twenty-one chairs how designers over time have reconciled the desire for design with the basic need to find a place to sit.  This exhibition is held in conjunction with the Minneapolis Institute of Arts 2010 Antiques and Design Fair, September 24-26, at the St. Paul Armory. ",

    "exhibition_description": "Until Now: Collecting the New (1960-2010) is an in-depth look at international artistic activity from around the globe. The exhibition explores more than seventy-five works, including paintings, sculpture, prints, installation art, photography, and video, by artists; who have altered the direction of art during the past fifty years. While some of these pieces are in the museum’s permanent collection, most are on loan from artists, collectors, and galleries. The roster of artists, which incorporates modern masters as well as those emerging on the scene, includes Siah Armajani, Willie Cole, Mona Hatoum, David Hockney, Ilya Kabakov, Yayoi Kusama, Takashi Murakami, Claes Oldenburg, Nam June Paik, Cindy Sherman, Yinka Shonibare, and Andy Warhol, among many others.\r\nPresenting a fresh vision of contemporary art, the exhibition also builds on the strengths of the museum’s renowned encyclopedic collection. Seeing contemporary art in the context of these diverse cultural forms and historical periods offers visitors new insights and perspectives on art’s ongoing significance and meaning.  In conjunction with this special exhibition, a new program titled “Art Remix” features selected works of contemporary art installed throughout the museum in a variety of juxtapositions with the museum’s culturally rich and diverse historical holdings.\r\nUntil Now is organized around general themes that encompass a broad range of global art activity that cut across time, cultures, and other borders. Reflecting significant trends in the recent history of art, these themes include “New Poetics,” “Reviving Realism,” “Poptical,” “Recuperation,” and “Passages.”",

The impact of Western artistic techniques is reflected in Kiyochika’s use of aerial views and pastel colors. By imitating Western-style etching, he made Japanese historic subjects strangely compelling. ",

While serving at the shogun’s court, Asano Naganori, the lord of a small rural fief, drew his sword on an abusive master of ceremonies, Kira Yoshinaka. For this egregious breach of protocol at court, Asano was ordered to commit ritual suicide. His fief was confiscated, and his retainers were disbanded. On a snowy night in 1703, forty-seven of Asano’s most loyal retainers attacked Kira’s mansion and beheaded him. For over a year, these men had plotted in secret to avenge their lord’s disgrace and death. Although they were all arrested for their crime and forced to commit suicide, the general populace lauded them as heroes for their fierce loyalty.\r\nThe event was quickly adapted for the Kabuki stage in several versions. That of 1748, known as Chu-shingura, became a box-office hit and has remained popular ever since. Woodblock print artists at first designed images of actors playing Chu-shingura roles. After the early 19th century however, people were so familiar with all the characters and subplots that artists depicted scenes from the play without reference to specific performances or actors. The prints in this gallery show some highlights of the \r\nChu-shingura story as well as the actors who delivered memorable performances of Japan’s favorite drama.",

    "exhibition_description": "This exhibition, continuing the series at Wells Fargo Center in downtown Minneapolis, comprises a variety of influential designers and celebrated workshops from the Nordic countries of Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland, with objects dating from the 1890s through the 1960s representative of prominent design movements. The stylistic diversity on display is unified by a common focus on democratic ideals, realized through underlying principles emphasizing practicality, affordability, and aesthetic appeal in design for a broad range of consumers. \r\nEarly works in ceramic display fin de siècle decorative embellishment on increasingly modernist forms. Colorful ceramics, from Josef Ekberg’s large-scale Art Nouveau vase, covered with an abstracted allium, to the bold geometry of the Fennia vase for Arabia Porcelain Factory, evidence advancement in graphic design toward an aesthetic vocabulary favoring pattern, symmetry, and precision. \r\nA number of refined works in metal highlight the emergence of the Nordic functionalist movement of the 1930s, marked by the central principle that form follows function. Objects such as a donut-shaped decanter by Harald Folmer Gross demonstrate the unadorned, minimalist aesthetic commonly associated with Nordic modernism in the twentieth century. This shift, prominently displayed at the influential 1930 Stockholm Exhibition, saw many designers, artists, and architects creating work that emphasized usefulness through a scaling back of decorative embellishment. But while functionalism saw its fullest realization in architecture, in the decorative arts its principles were embraced while also maintaining distinct references to handcrafts and tradition. \r\nBeginning in the 1950s, many designers developed a more sculptural and organic sensibility. A silver teapot by Karl Gustav Hansen, with a biomorphic shape and wicker handle, reveals not only a focus on simplicity and technical virtuosity, but also includes subtle yet distinct flourishes at the handle and spout.

The baskets on display demonstrate a dexterity and precision that required an immense amount of time, skill, and resources to produce.  \r\nThis exhibition also highlights how the tourist market opened the doors for new creative expressions and stands as testament to the ability of Native peoples to adapt to radical changes that were happening around them.

While teaching at the Tokyo School of Fine Arts, the first Japanese academy of fine arts, he met Earnest Fenollosa (1853-1908), an American philosopher and art historian who helped found the academy. In the midst of the Japan’s transformation into a modern industrial country, Fenollosa saw the need for preserving traditional Japanese art. With Fenollosa’s encouragement, Shøson started designing woodblock prints, which were sold mainly in the United States. During the 1910s and 1920s in collaboration with the famous print publisher Watanabe Shøzaburø, Shøson produced a number of commercial prints, which were marketed in Europe as well as in the U.S. The majority of his prints were kachø-ga—depictions of birds, flowers and small animals—in traditional Japanese style. Ever popular in the U.S., Shøson’s prints have only recently been rediscovered in Japan, where they are presently gaining in popularity among print collectors.",

Indigenous and visiting photographers have captured enduring images of the landscape, architecture, and inhabitants of Dixie, from the time of the Civil War up to the present.  E. J. Bellocq, for instance, sensitively portrayed women in the red-light district of New Orleans a century ago.  Walker Evans made many of his iconic Depression-era images in the South.  Danny Lyon documented the turbulent Civil Rights Movement there.  And contemporary photographers like our own Alec Soth have been drawn to the mysterious ways of everyday Southern folk.  The diverse work of these and many other photographers will present a rich collage of this southern sensibility.

    "exhibition_description": "This exhibition is a new ReMix that brings together 23 works from two major collectors whose strong personal identities characterize their maverick approach to collecting art. Over the past forty years, Myron Kunin has built one of the most important collections of early 20th century American art in this country; since the late 1960s, Gordon Locksley has been collecting contemporary art with a similar passion and verve. Pairings from these two remarkable collections provide a unique view of the evolution of art over the past century as well as of its enduring themes.",

    "exhibition_description": "Katsukawa Shunshø (1726-92) was one of the first woodblock print designers to create yakusha-nigao-e, or pictures that convey an actor’s actual, rather than idealized, appearance. The growing popularity of Kabuki, a highly stylized and melodramatic form of theater that appealed to Japan’s urban commoners, fostered a demand for images of popular actors.  Shunshø’s readily recognizable celebrities were greatly admired and helped evolve a taste for greater artistic realism. Print designers of the Katsukawa School closely emulated Shunshø’s style to create their “likeness” pictures of actors, but some achieved a greater degree of individuality than others. The prints on display in this gallery are by artists associated with the Katsukawa School, including Shunshø, the school’s founder, and his top pupils Shunkø (1743-1812) and Shun’ei (1762-1819). Images by Shunrø, better known as Katsushika Hokusai (1760-1849), are also included, since this renowned artist began his artistic career in the Katsukawa studio and later credited his success to this early training.

    "exhibition_title": "Japanese Seascapes and Fishing Scenes",
    "exhibition_description": "Extending roughly 2,000 miles long off the Asian coast of the Pacific Ocean, Japanese archipelago has a long jagged coastline. Situated in a volcanic zone along the Pacific deeps, Japan is particularly prone to earthquakes and tsunamis such as the recent disaster that struck the northeast coast of the country in March. This unique coastal terrain, on the other hand, affords breathtaking views. The small villages that historically dotted the rocky shore were home to fishermen and their families, who made their living from the abundance of the sea. \r\nThe prints in this gallery show Japan’s arresting coastal terrain and the boats and nets of the fishermen who pulled their daily catch from waters of the multitudinous inlets and bays.  Most of the images are from the series “Famous Places of the Sixty-odd Provinces,” designed by the artist Utagawa Hiroshige (1797-1858). The series was meant to appeal to city residents and thus to encourage them to travel.  Consequently, these prints convey the diverse beauty of the Japanese coast. In the wake of the current calamity in Japan, they are also a reminder of the generous side of nature. \r\nIn the hope that the communities affected by the recent disaster in Japan will rebuild, and the placid beauty of Japan’s northeast coast will return, this exhibition is dedicated to the victims of the March 11 earthquake and tsunami.",

    "exhibition_title": "Continuity and Change in Japanese Prints",
    "exhibition_description": "When the Tokugawa shogunate returned the rule of the country to the Emperor in 1868, Japan began a dynamic transformation. The new government vigorously pursued modernization, Westernization, and industrialization, and people sometimes found themselves torn between traditional values and progressive ideas. \r\nSome images designed around the turn of the century reflect a reluctance to accept Japan’s new modernity. This tendency was most obvious in works by artists involved in the shin-hanga movement that arose in the 1920s. These artists supported the traditional print production system, which involved collaboration between the artist, the publisher, woodblock carvers, and printers. In fact, this notion was counter to the modern idea that art should be a form of self-expression, and that artists should carve and print their own images. Shin-hanga artists preferred traditional subjects and often borrowed motifs from 19th century prints, although they were not completely immune to the influence of modern techniques. This unique mix of old and new was a distinguishing characteristic of shin-hanga prints.\r\nThis exhibition consists of eight pairs with similar subjects: a 19th century print and a 20th century one. Visual comparison reveals elements continuity and change in the works of artists who lived during Japan’s rapid modernization. ",

    "exhibition_description": "The word “panorama” was coined in the late eighteenth century by the Irish artist Robert Barker to describe his own elongated paintings.  Shortly after the invention of photography, in 1839, its practitioners also embraced the format, first making multiple-part pictures and, later on, individual images created with a succession of panoramic cameras. Most panoramic photographs fall into two categories; either they mimic normal human vision, or they extend it. Panoramas that mimic our vision are those that present a wider (or taller) view of a scene in a straightforward manner—one that an individual could take in on his or her own, by merely moving one’s head.  Panoramic photographs that extend our vision are those that show us something we cannot actually see on our own.  They extend not so much our vision of the world, but our comprehension of it, by stopping time, showing multiple views of a subject, or other results that only a camera can achieve.\r\nThe exhibition will comprise about thirty-five photographs, books by Josef Sudek and Edward Ruscha, one installation piece by Ken Fandell, and a coffee can reproducing a landscape by Ansel Adams.  Among the photographers represented are Berenice Abbott, Oscar Bailey, Frederick H. Evans, Christopher Faust, Gus Foster, Mark Klett, Stuart D. Klipper, O. G. Rejlander, Art Sinsabaugh, Todd Webb, and Jonathan Wells.  The photographs will range in time from 1848 (a daguerreotype) to within the last few years (digital color prints).  ",

His paintings are now found in public and private collections from coast to coast. This exhibition will bring together one of the most substantial groups of Rembrandt paintings assembled in America in a generation. While the main focus of the show will be on the artist and his remarkable development as a painter, attention will also be given to his influence on other artists, his status as an icon, and America’s relationship to his art. Taken as a whole, the Rembrandts in America have a distinctive character: the overwhelming majority are in portrait format whether they are portraits or not. The MIA’s own Lucretia, a single-figure half-length, is a prime example.\r\nThe paintings will be a placed in groups that attempt to illuminate specific issues, such as Rembrandt’s experimentation with different ways of handling paint, his interest in actual portraiture and in various types of fantasy portraiture, and the issue of defining the boundaries of his art. While this exhibition cannot be viewed as a full-scale retrospective, it will provide visitors the rare opportunity to observe Rembrandt’s evolution from brash young artist, to confident master, to resolute observer of timeless humanity. Rembrandt collecting has always been a challenging field. The works can be difficult and expensive to obtain, and questions of authenticity are ever present. American collectors—and they are not alone in this—have often bought paintings thinking that they were getting Rembrandts only to find out later that they were the product of other hands. For this reason, a number of works formerly attributed to Rembrandt will be displayed, including one or two for which the pendulum of scholarly opinion has swung back and forth. We hope to use this opportunity to suggest answers to the all too obvious but usually evaded question: If Rembrandt is such a genius, why is it so difficult to tell which paintings are his?\r\nThe exhibit",

Described as the \"Queen of the Adriatic\" with its maze of canals and confluence of Byzantine, Arab, and European architecture, Venice has also been a favorite subject for artists as they have strived to capture the city's unique character and beauty. From Renaissance woodcuts designed by Titian to Venetian views by Canaletto and Whistler, \"Venice on Paper\" explores the city through the graphic arts, bringing together five centuries of original prints, drawings, books, and photographs, all made in or about this enchanting \"floating\" city.",

After considering all of the proposals that were submitted, the panel chose a six-channel sound installation by Carla Rodriguez and Ethan Holbrook to be installed in the 2nd floor rotunda of the Target Wing. All of the panelists were impressed with the proposal's ability to create a subtle yet dramatic effect and how it would accentuate the acoustics of the rotunda. \r\n\r\nThe Panelists for MCAD@MIA were:\r\nElizabeth Armstrong, Curator of Contemporary Art/Director of Center for Alternative Museum Practice (CAMP), MIA\r\nChristopher Atkins, Coordinator for Minnesota Artists Exhibition Program, MIA\r\nJay Heikes, Artist\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to Vince Leo, MCAD Chair of Graduate Studies, MCAD President Jay Coogan, and MIA Director and President Kaywin Feldman for their support and partnership.",

    "exhibition_description": "“A Field Guide to Snow and Ice” is Paula McCartney’s photographic essay of images that recall the northern winter, including falling snow, icicles, and snowdrifts. But McCartney doesn’t work in a straightforward documentary style; she combines the grandeur of landscape photographs with delicate figure studies. She uses technical sleights of hand to affect scale; snowdrifts that appear larger than human scale are actually small piles of gypsum sand, and slender icicles are calcite stalactites that grow anonymously, over centuries, in caves. McCartney doesn’t look for images; she makes them. Her craft in shooting and printing her photographs is exacting; she is just as precise in her critique of assumptions about the truth-telling, indexical, and documentary aspects of photographic image making.",

Throughout her career, Miller has completely transformed gallery and public spaces with her riotously colored installations. The viewer is immediately pulled into the fastidious complexity of her craft and the beauty of natural and manufactured networks; the work seems to crawl, grow, and swallow up space. As a site-specific artist, Miller has spent many hours researching the MIA and its collection. She is especially interested in the Asian, African, and European collections of weapons and armor, and will find creative means to incorporate these objects into her installation.",

Taking that collection as a departure point, this exhibition brings attention to the museum’s modest but notable holdings of design from the post-World War II era to the present. American and European designers over the last six decades have explored abstraction of form, new technologies, new materials, and adventurous colors in items for household use. This exhibition focuses on these developments through over thirty examples of furniture, industrial design, jewelry, and other consumer objects, including notable recent acquisitions. Works by Americans Charles and Ray Eames, Harry Bertoia, Frank Gehry, and Michael Graves, as well as Europeans Eero Aarnio, Piero Fornasetti, and Jens Quistgaard, are among the designers included. ",

For centuries, artists of various nationalities and points of view have addressed this difficult subject in their work, creating distinctive expressions ranging from virulent anti-war sentiments to frank eyewitness accounts to personal reflections on loss and grief. Drawn primarily from the MIA’s extensive collection of graphic art, the 35 works on display include some of the most compelling representations of war and violence ever created. From Francisco Goya’s renowned Disasters of War etchings to Otto Dix’s infamous Der Krieg (War) portfolio to Daniel Heyman’s powerful portraits of tortured Iraqi War prisoners, the selection shines a bright light on the ravages of war and violence as seen through the eyes and minds of artists. \r\nAlso featured are important graphic works by Honoré Daumier, Käthe Kollwitz, Max Pechstein, Max Beckmann, George Bellows, George Grosz, Pablo Picasso, Jacob Lawrence, David Rathman, Ken Campbell, Stephen Dupont, as well as a major sculptural installation by British contemporary artists Dinos and Jake Chapman.\r\nThis exhibition was organized in conjunction with the museum-sponsored program MIA Inside/Out: Battle of Everyouth, a special one-night event presented as part of the Northern Spark Festival, a citywide celebration of experimental contemporary art in public places. This free program begins at sundown on Saturday, June 4, 2011, on the shared campus of the MIA and Minneapolis College of Art and Design. ",

    "exhibition_description": "A few years ago, a friend gave artist Jason Fulford a manila envelope, found at a flea market. The envelope contained over 80 photographs of different mushroom types, each composed and annotated with the care of someone who just had to be a mushroom collector. These anonymous photographs inspired Fulford to create his own collection of photographs, publications, sculptures, and performances, all under the umbrella of his fictional Soon Institute. Similar to the lifecycle of mushrooms, the project goes underground and periodically sprouts up in various artistic forms (including The Mushroom Collector, a book he published in 2010), in unexpected locations, such as New York, California, and Amsterdam. The “Mushroom Collector” is now rumored to be arriving this October at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts as part of “New Pictures 5,” and we are looking forward to seeing what form it will take.\r\nJohn Cage, the avant-garde musician, thinker, and, of course, mushroom collector, noted in his book For the Birds (1981), “It’s useless to pretend to know mushrooms. They escape your erudition. [The more you know them] the less sure you feel about identifying them.” Fulford’s  photographs draws inspiration from Cage’s pleasure, wonder, and openness in the pursuit of visual knowledge. The pictures appear to be unremarkable shots of commonplace objects, people, and places. Yet a closer look reveals humorous and subtle oddities: a crane lifting two ladders; a natural branch form casting an artificial multicolor shadow; a happy threesome running toward a cave as though part of a travel advertisement.  Instead of a singular, heroic photograph, Fulford’s images reveal themselves through repetition, sequences, relationships between form and shadow, abstraction and reality.  \r\nFulford is the co-founder of the publishing house J&L Books in Atlanta / New York, and the author of several titles, such as Sunbird (2000), Crushed (2003), and Raising Frogs for $$$ (2006). This will be his first museum exhibition.",

    "exhibition_title": "Bonjour Japon: A Parisian Love Affair with Japanese Art",
    "exhibition_description": "Like a tidal wave hitting the shore, the impact of Japanese art on European artists of the late nineteenth century was startling and profound. Japanese woodblock prints, screens, scrolls, and decorative objects opened new aesthetic possibilities, particularly for artists working in Paris at the turn of the century.  Ukiyo-e woodcuts and a wide variety of Japanese artifacts were on display at World Fairs, in commercial galleries, and in Parisian private collections. Virtually every artist working in Paris at the end of the century felt the influence of Japanese art. Western artists incorporated asymmetrical compositions, calligraphic lines, bird’s-eye views, flat areas of color, bold patterns, and outlines into their work. Inspired by the Japanese love of subjects from everyday life and nature, European artists explored similar themes, while Japanese screens, scrolls, and fans led to the appearance of similar formats in Parisian galleries and exhibitions. \r\nBonjour Japon: A Parisian Love Affair with Japanese Art will capitalize on two major strengths within the MIA’s permanent collection—turn-of-the-century French prints and Japanese art.  The works in this exhibition will come from the MIA’s permanent collection of prints and drawings and be organized into four thematic groupings mixing a broad scope of artists including Pierre Bonnard, Mary Cassatt, Edgar Degas, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, and Edouard Vuillard. The categories will echo the organization of the adjacent and complementary Edo Pop: The Graphic Impact of Japanese Prints.  This synergy will allow visitors to continue their journey through the museum and enable them to easily continue their exploration of the concept of ukiyo-e.",

She controls the physics of paint, but also lets go of that control to open up to the paint’s own properties. The irresistible tensions on the surfaces of her large-scale paintings keep viewers looking. Wall-Romana structures her paintings using an elaborate atmospheric perspective balanced with non-illusionistic color. A sharp student of art history, she conflates the still-life delicacies of the Dutch Golden Age with Mannerist attitudes towards scale, Hudson River School atmospherics, and yolky Abstract Expressionist smears. Formally, she pushes the physical properties of paint to their limit, with her use of thin, translucent colors to create delicate surfaces, and chalky impasto for ripe forms and textures.",

    "exhibition_title": "Facing the Lens: Portraits of Photographers",
    "exhibition_description": "Photographers, naturally, have a unique relationship with the camera, given it is their tool of choice.  They are accustomed to being behind it, shooting with it, and seeing the results of their efforts.  Many photographers are also comfortable situating themselves in front of their lenses, making self portraiture either an aspect of their work or its mainstay.  On the other hand, some are notoriously camera shy, allowing few photographic images of themselves--Henri Cartier-Bresson being among the most notable.\r\nPortraiture is one of the oldest, enduring, and constant genres of image making, in all media.  In the early decades of photography, humans made up the vast majority of subjects placed before the camera, because people believed whole-heartedly in the verisimilitude of the medium.  Since photographs were taken “from nature” and did not involve the hand of the artist, they were thought to perfectly depict the physical--and sometimes even spiritual--characteristics of the sitter.  Today, we know this to not necessarily be the case, and as photographers continue to confront the camera face on, the lens happily offers up photographic half truths and “lies.”\r\nThis exhibition features about 75 pieces, drawn largely from the MIA’s permanent collection, dating from the 1850s to within the last decade.  There are both self-portraits and images by other makers. The eye of the photographer is examined as a metaphor for seeing and the act of photographing and cameras are suggested as an extension of the photographer’s eye.  In this vein, images are included of Brassai, Bill Brandt, Man Ray, and Robert Mapplethorpe.\r\nThe idea that a single, solitary photographic image of an individual can fully represent its subject is, of course, spurious.  Multiple images, therefore, can fill in the blanks and give a more rounded impression of the sitter, as demonstrated by many acute photographers.  Eadweard Muybridge included sequential, full-figure profile images of himself in his mammoth 1880s project on human motion, in which he",

Carved by three sculptors, Jean de Marville, Claus de Verver, and the great giant, Claus Sluter, they have, with several important exceptions, remained in Dijon since they were carved in late 14th and early 15th centuries. \r\nThe exhibition consists of a small and powerful group of closely related works of art, which are, in effect, fragments of a single work of art. Issues of religion, grief, royalty, patronage, and authorship are raised by their removal from the original context in Dijon, and they will be, in effect, ambassadors to American FRAME museums from the Kingdom of Burgundy at its height.",

He began collecting seriously in the 1960s and never stopped, forming one of the greatest private collections of drawings in America in the 20th century. Traveling frequently to London and Italy in search of great drawings, the collection grew to a staggering 2,500 works before his death. It was not only remarkable for its size, but also its breadth and quality, guided by an exceptionally discerning eye.\r\nMr. McCrindle’s passion for drawings was matched by a generous spirit. Upon his death, his collection was divided up among some 30 American institutions, with the MIA acquiring a total of 98 works from his collection. Celebrating this extraordinary gift to the museum, this exhibition features selections from this rich, and very personal collection. And Mr. McCrindle’s generous legacy continues to enrich our institution. Four of the studies from his gift came to the museum in a fragile state, and they were recently conserved with a generous award from the Joseph F. McCrindle Foundation.",

    "exhibition_description": "In the early 14th century, Dante Alighieri wrote The Inferno, one of the most celebrated poems of all time. In writing about the human condition, Dante made his words accessible to a broad audience by writing in the vernacular Italian rather than the more elite language of Latin. Ever since The Inferno first appeared, readers have seen themselves and their neighbors in its timeless investigation of human frailty, and artists have repeatedly turned to the poem as a source of inspiration.\r\nIn a project that extended through the 1990s, painter/printmaker Michael Mazur and poet Robert Pinsky collaborated on the production of a new illustrated translation of The Inferno. Mazur said that in grappling with Dante, he reinvigorated his own artistic creativity. Pinsky, who became Poet Laureate of the United States in 1997, credited Mazur’s imagery with deepening his own understanding of the poem. In a shift from the practice of earlier artists, Mazur does not show us Dante travelling through Hell; rather, he shows us his interpretation of what Dante saw. Mazur’s investigation of The Inferno involved series produced in various media and culminated in a grand portfolio of etchings, the entirety of which appears alongside a selection of Dante’s verses translated by Pinsky. This is an opportunity to join two gifted modern artists—one working with images, the other with words—in their exploration of the depths of The Inferno, and of the human spirit itself.",

    "exhibition_description": "The world of the handmade object is changing. Makers, curators, collectors, and scholars are discussing the expansion of the contemporary craft field into conceptual areas. Crucial to this discussion is the current role of traditional values, such as function and perfection, as expressed through craft objects. Can these concepts be examined on a sliding scale of emphasis when applied to craft-based media?\r\n\r\nCraft and the Hand explores these various perspectives. The exhibition takes as a point of reference the role of the hand in contemporary craft, a fundamental concept that still has relevance in this changing field. Through objects in the MIA’s permanent collection and various loans, Craft and the Hand explores, through thematic groupings, how very different philosophies are carried out by craft-based artists in their work. These range from perfection of form through skill, to using excellent handcraft to achieve a conceptual emphasis, to conscious elimination of the mark of the hand. Featured artists include Bob Stocksdale, Warren MacKenzie, Ken Price, Susan Warner, Frank E. Cummings III, and Amy Sabrina.",

    "exhibition_description": "Prior to 1450, all European books were made by hand. Scribes copied texts letter by letter. To illustrate or decorate the pages, artists used pens and brushes to apply ink or paint, and sometimes further embellished them with burnished gold. In the last half of the 15th century, however, books changed dramatically. By the year 1500, printing presses had taken over much of the work.\r\nJohannes Gutenberg’s invention of movable type—perfected by 1450—immediately revolutionized the replication of texts, but the transformation of illustration and decoration took longer. For decades, many books were hybrids with printed texts and hand-made decoration. Printed images—with or without coloring—slowly began to appear in books. \r\nBefore the printing revolution, the most skilled artists illustrated only books meant for the richest and most powerful patrons. Once printed images could be issued in great numbers, however, great artists began to design illustrations for books catering to the middle class. Albrecht Dürer so fully understood the potential of printed books of pictures that he even assumed the role of publisher, taking control of the entire process, from design, to production, to distribution. His illustrations for The Apocalypse (1498) proved black-and-white images could be so compelling that one would not want to spoil them with coloring.\r\nBy looking at single leaves from books dismembered long ago, one can reconstruct the history of book illustration. Here you can see comparisons of painted and printed works, as well as objects that combine both processes. In many cases, the printed works were made to simulate their painted predecessors, but sometimes influence ran in the opposite direction. Witness the ingenuity printers brought to mass production. Some attempted to print text and image from a single surface or to employ modular elements that could be re-used and re-combined. Others tried to use finely engraved copper printing plates, although woodcuts ultimately proved more practical. While the gem-like quality ",

Early, innovative photographers and filmmakers were fundamental to this transformation, creating powerful images that put millions of people in the center of the historic, athletic-action.  The Sports Show spotlights the artistry and cultural significance of this shift.\r\nEarly 20th-century photographers first captured leisure sports. Jacques-Henri Lartigue’s photographs of his family’s adventures driving racecars and flying planes exemplified these private and personal endeavors. Media imagery, however, quickly moved sports into the public arena. By the 1960s, televised events radically altered the nature of sports, players’ standings, and fans’ participation.  Charismatic professional athletes—Joe Namath, Muhammad Ali and others—became international pop icons, and television audiences expanded exponentially.  Roger Welch’s The O.J. Simpson Project, reveals Simpson’s early attempts to shape his popular image as a non-athlete, and is seen in the exhibition for the first time in the U.S. since its 1977 premier. \r\nNow, in the 21st century, body-thumping music, roaming cameras, and multi-screen global broadcasts of sporting events create larger-than-life spectacles that attract the critical attention of contemporary artists. Capturing the power of these events, a centerpiece of the exhibition is Paul Pfeiffer’s The Saints, an immersive sound-and-video installation based on the 1966 World Cup final between Germany and Great Britain, which examines nationalism and crowd dynamics in sports. It was shown previously at Hamburger Bahn of in Berlin, Germany, and the Guggenheim Museum, Bilbao, Spain. The installation at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts is its U.S. premier.\r\nThe Sports Show features approximately 175 astonishing works arranged around themes such as Leisure; Circulation; Politics; Icons; Race; and Spectacle.

More recently, pop-up parks have begun to spring up, especially in urban spaces where they can offer a sense of respite for those looking to escape without leaving their environs.\r\n\r\nDuring Minnesota’s cold winter months, the Minneapolis Institute of Arts will be host to a new pop-up park, which will transform the museum’s cool, white lobby into a relaxing, tropical oasis with grass, palm trees, and other South Seas amenities.

    "exhibition_description": "Since the Arts and Crafts movement of the early 20th century, women have been an active force in craft and design. Its predominant aims were to produce beautifully designed and well-made objects for e everyday use. The movement’s democratic ambitions appealed to women artists who were not only encouraged to participate, but to lead. The innovation and creation of these early female modernists continues today, with handcrafted, unique objects and utilitarian works designed for mass production. \r\n\r\nDrawing from the collection of the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, this exhibition at the Wells Fargo Center in downtown Minneapolis showcases the talents of women in the fields of industrial design and craft. Examples of industrial design come from a diverse array of pioneering women, including British silver designer Kate Harris, American inventor Marion Weeber, and lifelong designer Eva Zeisel, who recently passed away at the age of 105. Works by contemporary craft artists include vessels by British ceramicist Jennifer Lee, American wood artist Virginia Dotson, and local artist Jan McKeachie-Johnson. Combined, this selection of objects highlights the creativity and skill women have used to transform everyday objects into fascinating and beautiful works.",

    "exhibition_description": "Creating views of various locales in sets of eight has a long history in Japan. The concept originated in China during the Song dynasty, with a cycle of eight poems lauding the beauty at the confluence of the Xiao and Xiang rivers. The area where these rivers meet—in Hunan Province, in southeastern China—became a favorite subject for painters, who followed the themes established in the poems. The Chinese paintings inspired artists in other East Asian countries to adapt the eight themes to their local landscapes.\r\nIn Japan, the Eight Views of Ømi (Ømi hakkei) was the first such series. The scenery around Lake Biwa, the country’s largest lake, located in Ømi Province, resembled the Eight Views of the Xiao and Xiang. By the late 17th century, the Eight Views of Ømi was a well-known subject among Japanese painters and print designers. Later, artists also depicted eight views of other places, such as the oceanside town of Kanazawa and the Sumida River in Edo. Whatever the location, the images echoed the original eight themes: homing geese, returning sailboats, clearing weather, evening snow, autumn moon, night rain, evening bells, and evening glow.",

By the 1720s, it had grown into one of the world’s largest cities, with a population of over a million. In 1868 it was renamed Tokyo. Edo occupied about a third of today’s sprawling metropolis.\r\nShops and businesses, including restaurants and popular theaters, flourished under the patronage of a bourgeoning well-to-do middle class whose daily activities contributed to the hustle and bustle of a lively downtown area. The city’s outskirts, separated from the urban center by rivers and canals, retained their rural character. Consequently, Edoites regularly enjoyed seasonal outings and flower viewing without traveling very far. Various festivals held in neighborhood shrines and temples to mark the seasons attracted throngs of visitors.\r\nThe prints in this gallery, designed by three popular artists active between the late 18th century and the mid-19th, show crowds, street life, and seasonal activities in the vibrant city of Edo.",

Men enjoyed the sexual appeal of these femmes fatales, while women studied them for the latest fashions. The expert craftsmanship of the block carvers and printers meant the colors and patterns of women’s robes were lavishly reproduced. Hair accessories, makeup, and the latest consumer products were also carefully noted. Women clamored to emulate styles they encountered in the prints, fueling an entire industry that catered to quickly changing tastes and trends. For today’s art lovers and scholars, these details provide insight into Japanese social norms and exotic crazes during the Edo period. The prints in this gallery—all depicting beauties—date from the 18th and 19th centuries.",

After considering all of the proposals that were submitted, the panel chose an installation by MCAD students Luke Axelson and Josh Ritenour titled “transfiguration.” The proposed work will use reflective material and geometric forms to provide a layered experience of space and light in the stairwell of the new Target wing. \r\nThe 2012 panelists for MCAD@MIA were:\r\nCameron Gainer, artist\r\nMelinda Hobbs-Childs, director of Artist Services, Forecast Public Art\r\nChristopher Atkins, coordinator, Minnesota Artists Exhibition Program, MIA",

    "exhibition_description": "Contemporary fiber artists working over the last forty years have mined American folk quilts for techniques and patterns commonly seen in these ubiquitous domestic objects.  Drawing inspiration from the quilt’s geometric structure, contrasting, often bold color and fabric combinations, and decorative layers of stitches, the artists featured in this exhibition explore personal expression through references to this traditional textile art. Combining multiple techniques with a conscious, sophisticated approach to composition, many of these works can be seen in the context of the so-called “surface design” movement active since the 1970s. \r\n “Layered Abstraction” features a variety of contemporary fiber art from the MIA’s collection.  In addition to works by Sheila Hicks, Jack Lenor Larsen, and Jan Myers, it will showcase a recent MIA acquisition: Mary Lee Bendolph’s striking quilt, Strings, a contemporary example of the Gee’s Bend, Alabama quilting style. Strings well illustrates how the Gee’s Bend quilters have interpreted traditional designs in highly-individualized fashions, producing functional quilts that are now prized as abstract artworks.  The exhibition will also feature quilt-inspired garments from the Goldstein Museum of Design and, as part of the MIA’s ReMix initiative, an exploration of layered abstraction in relief sculpture by Minnesota abstract artist Charles Biederman.",

    "exhibition_description": "In collaboration with world-renowned English culinary historian Ivan Day, the Minneapolis Institute of Arts will present the exhibition, Supper with Shakespeare: The Evolution of English Banqueting, December 13, 2012 – March 31, 2013. The term “banquet” in the context of sixteenth and seventeenth century England meant a visually striking collection of after dinner sweet foods, preserves, and confections. In Shakespeare’s time (he died in 1616), such displays of culinary wonder were among the most magnificent in the history of British dining. Banquets were intended to impress and delight diners while the servants cleared the remains of the main feast, so they were often held in outdoor “banqueting houses” or in an intimate chamber such as the MIA’s Tudor Room.  \r\nIn 1923, the Minneapolis Institute of Arts installed the Tudor Room as the museum's first period room, calling it \"the very embodiment of the spirit of the seventeenth century.\" Furnished with a rich assortment of tables, chairs, and case furniture that evoke the furnishings and lifestyle of Tudor England, the room’s oak paneling dates to about 1600. Once part of a private chamber used for eating, sitting, and entertaining guests, the room came to the MIA with a history of use in a manor in Suffolk, England. \r\nFor Supper with Shakespeare, the Tudor Room will be laid out with a full banquet of period culinary delights hand-crafted by Ivan Day. The exhibition will continue in the adjacent Briggs Court, featuring dining related objects of silver, ceramic, and glass from the MIA’s collection, as well as an assortment of loan objects such as period cookbooks, food moulds, and kitchen utensils.  The whole will enchant art lovers and foodies alike!  \r\nPlanned programs include a “Supper with Shakespeare” public lecture by guest curator Ivan Day on Thursday, December 13, 2012 at 11:00 am, sponsored by the Friends of the MIA; a private Tudor-inspired feast curated by Ivan Day, date TBD, complete with a special Tudor inspired ale locally brewed for the occasion; and",

Luke Aleckson is interested in how these low-tech images are designed to encode then release information. By themselves, the wall-mounted sculptures in his fascinating exhibition UNPAC (Uniform Non-coding Parallax Autostereogrammic Cyclopti-cryptograms) are complex wood abstractions carved using a home-made routing machine. But when they are looked at like stereograms, the image he has inserted into the piece will appear. In this case, visitors will see an image of the 8-foot cube Aleckson built in the gallery; it is made from a maple veneer that matches the same wood and stain treatment of the surfaces in the Target Wing rotunda and door jambs.",

His fastidious drawings, sculptures, and books are a collaboration with excerpts from classic literature but he has replaced the words with thousands of individual \"Es\", inserted gaps, and bent the lines to make the original text unreadable. He is exacting in how the resulting forms follow the precise word count of the original text, yet, like a concrete poem, turned them into abstract and architectural compositions of the narrative that spread the edge of the page. The silver-point mark making he uses in the large-scale graphite and ink drawings will slowly tarnish, turn to black, and no longer be visible on the hand-made paper. Also on display in “Deeper Wonders Than the Waves” are scattered floor sculptures are bent paper drawings that barely stand up as 3-dimensional forms. Finally, there is Quinn’s self-published book which is bound with hundreds of screen-copied prints of the same page.",

Taking frequent trips to visit family and friends in Nepal over the years, he has returned with recorded testimonies from others who have seen and suffered the violence firsthand. In Nine Steps dozens of his earthenware pots have been punctured and torn apart. Shrestha’s installations and smaller works, made of elemental materials such as mud, wood, and sand, are metaphors for the collective human bodies who have suffered from intense physical and political pressures.",

    "exhibition_title": "Picturing Poverty: Artistic Views of the Poor in the Baroque Era",
    "exhibition_description": "During the 17th century, artists in Europe began looking to everyday life for their subjects, with special attention to the poor.\r\nThe plight of the impoverished came to the fore during the Thirty Years War (1618–48), which reduced broad swaths of Europe to subsistence living or starvation. People were also familiar with Gospel teachings that exalted the poor as inheritors of the kingdom of heaven. Jesus himself was born in a humble stable and had simple shepherds as his first visitors. Artist after artist depicted the Holy Family’s flight into Egypt, riding on a donkey and cooking over a campfire. A strong note of compassion informed the work of Stefano della Bella and Rembrandt, whose portrayals of wretched humanity in this exhibition often took on a remarkably personal character.\r\nMany artists were able to find a sort of ragged dignity in the lower levels of society. They showed the poor in attitudes of industrious acceptance or stoicism, where a battered hat became a crown of virtue, a sign of resolute endurance of a miserable life. Such fortitude found adherents especially in France with the Le Nain brothers, whose sympathies are evident in the realism of their painting now in the Louvre, where poor farmers are portrayed, in all their deprivation and sad acceptance of poverty.\r\nIn other cases, an insistent attention to the decorative value of tattered and patched clothes—torn caps and shoes, wrinkles, sagging cheeks—suggests a colder curiosity, a simple pleasure in the representation of the picturesque, and a willingness to caricature misery.\r\nAs this exhibition demonstrates, artists interpreted poverty in many ways. For Adriaen van Ostade, it sometimes became the equivalent (both in cause and consequence) of spiritual misery. For William Hogarth, it would lead to the social denunciation described in his famous satire Gin Lane (1751). Whether the emphasis was on debauchery or the delineation of a frayed hem, the work of Baroque-era artists found the poor to be rich subject matter indeed.",

Comprised of day-glo gestural landscapes, paintings made after Ansel Adams photographs, and cinder block table sculptures, “Seven Billion” is a response to the aesthetic projects of modern art and architecture. It’s no accident that Fitz’s work is made from economical materials such as insulation foam and chip board, or that he works so quickly. By doing so he wants to leave his decision making process visible and make a counter-point to the legacy of modern painters and sculptors. This leaves his work wide open for questions about the sacred value given art, the environmental concerns of art making, and the emphasis placed on craft and presentation. Fitz’s work has been part of group exhibitions at Form+Content, the Soap Factory and Weisman Art Museum.",

    "exhibition_description": "China's Terracotta Warriors: The First Emperor's Legacy brings to Minneapolis one of the greatest archaeological discoveries of our times. MIA was one of the first museums outside China to feature these figures in a small display held in 1985. Twenty-six years have passed since that exhibition. Every day, as the Chinese archaeologists toil away around the burial mound of one of the most remarkable figures in the history of China – the First Emperor – new finds and moments of the wealth of China’s ancient past are revealed. This is an epic story that has begun but is far from fully told.\r\nDrawn from over thirteen institutions in China including the Museum of Terracotta Warriors and Horses, the Shaanxi Provincial Archaeological Institute and the Shaanxi History Museum, the exhibition is about an extraordinary man who has so impressed himself on the unfolding drama of the history of the Middle Kingdom. Born in a time of turmoil in China’s history, known as the Warring States period (475–221 BCE) this man was the founder of the short-lived Qin dynasty (221-206 BCE). He forged the seven warring states into one nation and himself from king of Qin Shihuang state to First Emperor. He left a legacy of a centralized and bureaucratic state that would be carried onto successive dynasties over the next two millennia.\r\nDriven by his eagerness for immortality, from the moment Qin Shihuang ascended the throne of the Qin state at the age of thirteen he began to construct his burial. The complex plan and symbolic content of the mausoleum, as gradually revealed by the ongoing archaeological excavations, are far beyond anyone’s imagination, and beyond the boundary of the original protective outer wall which extends over 2km from north to south and nearly 1km from east to west. The Terracotta Army was discovered by accident in 1974 approximately 1km from the Emperor’s tomb mound by local farmers who were drilling a well. Shortly thereafter Chinese archaeologists excavated three pits containing, what is estimated to be, over 7,000 ter",

William McWillie and his wife Catherine built Kirkwood after arriving from South Carolina in about 1845. By 1857, McWillie had become governor of Mississippi and Kirkwood was a large cotton plantation with nearly 200 slaves. African Americans produced much of the material objects needed on the self-sustaining plantation, which included a smoke house, winery, bakery, and blacksmith shop. A skilled and no doubt valued carpenter and builder, William Howard remained on the plantation after the Civil War. While we have no record of his own sentiments regarding his continuation at Kirkwood, an 1869 letter from Mrs. McWillie to her son expresses her hope that, “…Willie may conclude to live ever here and give his precious wife and children as well as his beloved self a chance for a long and useful life.” ",

Bill and Libby Clark amassed one of the world’s finest collections of Japanese art according to their own finely honed interests, instincts, and idiosyncrasies. Not trends. Not markets. Not a particular time, place, or medium. They collected what they liked—what drew their audacious eyes.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis exhibition hints at the stunning variety and bold taste that accorded the Clarks’ endeavor, begun in the late 1970s, a kind of legendary status. Tucked in the agricultural valley of central California, their collection grew from frequent trips to Japan, stoking their enthusiasm for Japanese aesthetics—their home is a blend of Japanese and California Arts and Crafts styles. The combined collection of the Clarks and the Clark Center for Japanese Art & Culture reached almost 1,700 objects, ranging across 10 centuries and from paintings to sculpture, ceramics to textiles, woodblock prints to works of bamboo. They include important examples from every school of painting in Japan since the 16th century and from some of its most acclaimed living artists, including 80 pieces by ceramist Fukami Sueharu—the largest assembly of his sleek bluish-white porcelain in the world.",

The outcome of this endeavor is not only an exhibition, but more importantly: an unvarnished series of interpretations that deal with the psychological phenomenon of selected memory and perception.\r\nBrewer will invite visitors to fill out a simple description form, a request to isolate one piece within the entire collection that has a personal resonance, and then put it into words. Patrons will fill out the description form, which will be provided at the entrance of each gallery. He will collect the forms each week and create replica of the works, based on the descriptions, to be executed in his studio. The editing process of the pieces will be organic and judicious and in consideration of the MAEP gallery space.The weight, history and origin of words will alone dictate the outcome of each piece.",

    "exhibition_description": "This exhibition commemorates the 100-year anniversary of the MIA’s crown jewel of Prairie School architecture, the Purcell-Cutts House, through a celebration of the design work of George Grant Elmslie (1869-1952). \r\n\r\nHaving worked for Louis Sullivan (1856-1924) for nearly twenty years, Elmslie became well-versed in organic design principles, carrying them over in the exceptional work of the Minneapolis firms of Purcell, Feick and Elmslie (1910-1913) and Purcell and Elmslie (1913-1921). His contributions to the integrated decorative schemes developed by the firms often included a combination of elements such as terra cotta, stained glass, stenciling, furniture, murals, and sawed wood, to create a harmonic whole greater than the sum of its parts. \r\n\r\nElmslie’s design drawing for the firm, rarely shown and minimally published, are delicate and beautiful studies, though they were meant to communicate to his partners and to the craftsmen who would execute these elements. The majority of these drawings are housed in the William Gray Purcell Papers at the Northwest Architectural Archives at the University of Minnesota. The exhibition will focus on the drawings as art objects, and as documents of the collaborative process of producing organic architecture. “The Progressive Pencil” would feature drawings for the Purcell-Cutts House and other notable Purcell and Elmslie projects such as the Merchants Bank of Winona, Minnesota (1911-13), along with historic photos and selected objects. Recent MIA acquisitions by Elmslie will also be featured, including the one-of-a-kind dining room suite for Mrs. Hanna (1915) with its wealth of detail.  It will include approximately 15-20 of George Grant Elmslie’s elegant design drawings, alongside photos and related objects from the MIA and local collections. ",

    "exhibition_description": "During the 15th century, the bedroom was the most private and symbolic room in patrician homes. It was the locus of conception, birth, sickness, and death. \r\n\r\nLeon Battista Alberti (1404–1472), the famous architect and theorist of the Renaissance, in his book “On the Family” (1432), describes how the newlywed husband gave his bride a tour of the house, finally entering the bedroom and locking the door. But his next move did not involve the rustling of fabric and the exposure of flesh. Instead, Alberti’s groom shows his new bride all the valuables—silverware, tapestries, clothing, and gems, as well as the splendid furniture where all these things would be secured. This passage makes clear how important the bedroom was at that time—a space of family privacy and splendor.\r\n\r\nIn the most luxurious palaces, tapestries embellished the bedroom walls and helped to control temperature. A small altar for devotion was always present, often an image of the Virgin Mary with her child, propitious for childbearing. The rooms had no closets, and cupboards or armoires had not come into use; instead, chests were the means of storage. Such chests—cassoni in Italian—were richly decorated or painted with fables or episodes from the history. They were a fundamental item of home decoration and considered the most symbolic piece of furniture connected with marriage. Great attention was therefore paid to the subjects represented upon them, allusive to the husband’s qualities, to the wife’s chastity and obedience, and to the family’s glory and wealth. Scenes of battle—reminders of hard-won power or triumphant moral virtue—were favored, and one assumes that they were also entertaining conversation pieces.\r\n\r\nClothing, wedding gifts, family documents, and other treasures were locked up in the cassoni. Smaller elegant boxes contained jewelry, sewing kits, or other personal items. The bed—the focal point of the room, and a very monument to lineage and fertility—was a complex machine, often placed on a raised platform that in some cases was a",

These shapes are cut out of Styrofoam sheets, sanded into opaque geometric forms and lit from within by LED bulbs. The installation will produce a large-scale, gently glowing effect, with each shape resembling a crystalized milk bubble.\r\nNicholas’s previous installations have also been ambitious, room-filling accumulations made from thousands of individual parts. His materials have included blue plastic zip ties, inflated silvery Mylar balloons, and bright red, fuzzy pipe cleaners. The artist intends for these manufactured materials to mimic microbiological forms as they spread and grow throughout the gallery.",

They can change their colors and patterns instantly, whether for communicating or active camouflage, as their chromatophores (pigment-containing and light-reflecting parts of cells) are expanded or contracted.\r\nDuluth artist Ryuta Nakajima has been studying the color-changing physiology and behavior of cephalopods in Japan. Using waterproof images of artworks from the MIA’s collection, he has photographed cuttlefish responding to and attempting to replicate the colors and patterns of European paintings, Japanese prints, and Islamic decorations. Nakajima has also created plastic molds of small cuttlefish, which he will mass-produce and paint in various patterns that mimic and stylize the cephalopod color-changing properties. Nakajima likens them to collectible Japanese Kubrick dolls.",

Shells are common, abundant and, at the same time, can be precious and extremely desirable. Their sound, when drawn to the ears, is the evocative, infinite sound of the waves.\r\nFrom the islands of the Pacific to African villages, from prehistoric shacks to the most sophisticated courts of Baroque Europe, the shells’ translucent texture and their complex and fantastic forms can be recognized in everyday objects, in decorative patterns, in figurative symbols and in an incredible variety of art works.\r\nShells assume a primary position in the naturalistic studies of the modern era, along with the discovery of new lands, and the improvement of optical instruments. Their forms attest not only to the perfection and magnificence of creation, but also visually make manifest mathematical logarithms; they also bring to life, and help to solve, the religious drama of the evolutionary problem.\r\nCollecting shells can also be an expensive mania, as the first Mannerist Wunderkammern testify. There, nautilus and conches were mounted in precious metals, adorned with gems, “portrayed” by painters in still lifes, and displayed in magnificent cabinets—a pride of place in keeping with the importance of shells as an important field of naturalistic studies. \r\nMinneapolis and its surrounding area possess various treasures contained in the Minneapolis Institute of Arts and public libraries, including the Wangensteen Historical Library and the James Ford Bell Library—which, together, represent an immense patrimony of prints and precious antique books on natural history. \r\nThe exhibition encompasses the passion for shells from the Wunderkammer to the post-Linnaean era. A small section is devoted to the still nowadays never-extinguished fever of shell-collecting.",

The deliberations were not easy, as each proposal was unique, challenging and rewarding in different ways. But we were impressed with the overall quality of the proposals that reflected both the applicants’ strengths and the spaces of the MIA. We welcome and look forward to working with these talented students and continuing our partnership with Minneapolis College of Art and Design. \r\n\r\nAfter careful deliberations, the panel chose Josh Manoles and Linnea Stephan’s proposal for a wall installation of a pictographic character system derived from objects in the museum collection. Situated on the main staircase wall that connects all three floors of the museum, the pictographic system will highlight ties between different collections and provide a visually dynamic wayfinding guide.\r\n\r\nThe panelists for MCAD@MIA this year were: Christopher Atkins, Coordinator, Minnesota Artists Exhibition Program, MIA; Karen Wirth, Vice President of Academic Affairs, Minneapolis College of Art and Design; Jennifer Phelps, Director of the Burnet Gallery, Le Meridien Chambers, Minneapolis; Chris Larson, artist and professor University of Minnesota-Twin Cities.

Using a range of sculptural, installation, drawing and documentation techniques, she investigates the specific qualities of materials and objects to articulate a gesture or statement. \r\n\r\nInspired by thoughts of accumulation, structure and failure, Estell will create a largescale silicone rubber sculptural installation for the MAEP gallery space. In my studio, the work will begin by making a series of structures out of cardboard shipping boxes of various sizes. The boxes will be stacked on each other and secured to shape solid mountainous, pyramidic forms. A range of these forms with gradated shaping and dimensions will be designed to sit centrally within the gallery space and reach a maximum peak height of up to twelve feet. Once the individual stack forms are constructed, I will apply multiple layers of silicone molding rubber to all of the exterior surfaces of the structures. The limp, empty and soft rubber shells will be given structure and rearticulated in the MAEP space by being suspended from hundreds of monofilament lines that will be attached from inside the form (with custom rubber hardware) at strategic corner locations. The replicated stacked box installation will become something of a mountainous marionette as it is lifted by lines from hundreds of points and pulled into shape while still revealing its true flaccid and sagging material nature.",

The other story is that of the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, a museum that recognizes the power of photography as “the leading and only popular visual means” in the 1970s. A third story is of a curator, the late Carroll T. Hartwell (known as Ted), the MIA’s founding curator of photography, and his long-standing friendship with Martin.

In China, the majority of these groups commonly call themselves Miao.\r\nThe Chinese Miao people are famous for their embroidery skills and indigo dyeing techniques, and for underscoring the central roles of textiles and jewelry in their culture. Styles of Miao costume are diverse among the culture’s various sub-groups. A popular saying states “If you meet one hundred Miaos, you will see one hundred costumes.” Chinese anthropologists and art historians have noted that there are more than 170 different costumes from various geographic regions, which then fall into distinct categories. Even within the same village, the great variety of Miao dress and jewelry reflects the different functions of each costume: clothes indicate marital status, age, and ceremony.\r\nThe elaborate festival costumes and silver adornments constitute the most significant forms of Miao visual art. Such costumes are not only important possessions, but also considered the living visual art form of Miao culture.

Of particular interest is how knowledge of soil might affect visitors thinking about the ground on which the museum sits, as well as understand historical depictions of the landscape and objects made of materials from the ground.

    "exhibition_description": "This spectacular havdalah spice box, recently acquired by the MIA, was made in Rome during a crucial period of emancipation. A time when Roman Jews first enjoyed full civil rights, albeit briefly.\r\nIt was made by Giovacchino Belli (1756–1822), the leading Roman silversmith of his time, who generally worked for the pope and high-ranking nobility. A symbol of religious freedom and a testament to the new status of the Roman Jewish community, the spice box epitomizes the neoclassical style, often associated with enlightenment and freedom. It is the same style employed by the young American nation in those years to symbolize its freedom and independence.",

    "exhibition_description": "In the 1930s, American poet Ezra Pound famously encouraged modern artists to “make it new.”  Modernists did so through abstraction, 12 tone music, collage, photomontage, and other experimental approaches to the visual arts, film, dance, and architecture.   Today, to make it absolutely new is almost impossible given the sheer quantity of art produced since Pound’s slogan.  Still, contemporary artists certainly make art that is new, again.  And historic artworks acquire new meanings in our time.  This photography exhibition will feature a selection of recent museum acquisitions by Richard Avedon, Stan Douglas, Marco Breuer, and Margaret Bourke-White, among others – many will be presented in the MIA galleries for the first time – in an innovative installation that reveals how powerful images acquire new and provocative meanings in different historical situations.",

    "exhibition_description": "Two different approaches to understanding and depicting nature melded—with beguiling results—as the long interlacing of British and Indian cultures on the subcontinent came to a head in the 17th and 18th centuries, an uneasy period of spreading colonial rule. This exhibition showcases these unique representations of nature, commissioned from Indian artists by Indian princes and increasingly powerful European colonial patrons—an artistic and scientific confluence that forever reshaped the way we view the natural world.At the heart of the exhibition are 10 “Lady Impey” paintings on loan from Bill Clark. A British colonialist in Calcutta, Lady Mary Impey commissioned Indian painters to illustrate birds from her private menagerie, resulting in more than 200 images that owe as much to European natural science as India’s rich painterly tradition.",

He has done this by carefully choosing images that both test the limits of what is an acceptable level of sentimentality for critical art, and offer visual pleasures that also contain sensations of alienation and loss. With a relatively small number of works, \"How to Make a World\" is meant to engage the various and contradicting claims made on painting regarding beauty, artistic merit, and its relevance as a medium. \r\nThe driving principle of Jonathan Bruce Williams MAEP exhibition will be to display the science and technology of vision.

These objects share an inherent practicality, but are thoughtfully designed for an elevation of the user’s experience. Strong undercurrents in the exhibition include: the use of natural and local materials; respect for and closeness to nature, with an ecological emphasis; a high level of quality in all aspects; and a sense of wonder. Finland: Designed Environments is the first significant museum-organized exhibition outside Finland since the 1990s to examine the breadth of current Finnish design.\r\nThe exhibition Finland: Designed Environments will encompass furnishings, fashion, and craft, as well as architecture and urbanism.

A picture of a child breastfeeding. Ants carrying a grain of sugar. A tiny chrysalis on a blade of grass. She views the world with a playful, thought-provoking, and critically detached curiosity.\r\nKawauchi is also well known for her photography books, which present an evocative sequence of images unfolding on every spread. She has produced 15 photo books since 2001, including Light and Shadow (2012) and Illuminance, Ametsuchi, Seeing Shadow (2012). Now living and working in Tokyo, Kawauchi has exhibited around the world, including a recent solo exhibition at the prestigious Tokyo Metropolitan Museum of Photography in 2012.",

The work was painted during his exile in Amsterdam between September 1944 and October 1945 under difficult wartime circumstances. In his journal, Beckmann refers to air raids and lack of food, coal and electricity; in fact, much of the triptych was painted by candlelight. The MIA acquired Blind Man’s Buff in 1955. It is consistently counted among the top five important artworks owned by the museum. Unfortunately, despite its controlled environment, the fragility of the three panels increases yearly, due to structural instability and surface deterioration. \r\n\r\nThe conservation treatment of the Max Beckmann triptych has been generously funded by Bank of America's Art Conservation Project, and will be conducted over a four-month period by the MIA’s art conservation provider, the Midwest Art Conservation Center (MACC), and under the supervision of the MIA. MACC is a non-profit regional conservation facility housed within the museum, making frequent conservator-curator consultation throughout the treatment possible.",

His fascinating MAEP exhibition will present a running text of Henry David Thoreau’s \"Walden\" on a set of highway message boards. By converting this classic meditation on the beauty of wilderness and creative isolation into tiny 3-line bits of text, Rutter’s installation will conflate the private and slow-paced act of reading with the fast-lane drive through the natural landscape.  It will also reflect on the Rutter’s understanding of transcendentalist philosophy, which he links to American values of individualism, car culture and exploration. ",

His chaotic installations draw from his stockpile of holiday ephemera, which includes miles of wrapping paper and dozens of Christmas tree skirts. Obscure religious iconography is layered throughout the wall collages and sculptures, creating a riot of patterning and appropriated symbolism that find the divine in throwaway materials. The exhibition title, Delta Delta Delta Force, connotes secret letter and military organizations that have their own initiation rites and symbolism. The gallery will be lit with a deep red glow, and a low delta wave hum will emphasize Messerschmidt’s surreal, free-associative imagery.",

It may appear that the bricks and hero’s face in “When You’re Dead, You’re Dead” are cut, then pasted, but each detail is meticulously handpainted.

It is this story, whether arising from persecution, criminal intent, or a depraved sense of passion, that artists find so intriguing.\r\n Today, with murder constantly in the news—if it bleeds, it leads—and saturating our entertainment, from video games to mystery novels, we may be desensitized to its frightening reality. And yet our fascination with the ultimate crime endures, suggesting a primal need to grapple with its brutal truth. Artists, too, feel compelled to explore this meaning, as seen in the works here.\r\nThis exhibition was drawn from the MIA’s permanent collection of graphic Art and photography, and was complemented by key loans from private collectors.",

It was the values we had expressed in those structures that I sought and attempted to elicit in photographs and text.\r\n\r\nBeginning in 1999 – four years after the first democratic elections brought Nelson Mandela to power - and continuing into the present, I have engaged in a similar photography of some of the structures that have emerged with our democracy and that I believe are expressive of values in this new, still nascent and yet in many ways old way of being in our society.\r\n\r\nThe photographs exhibited here are from these two separate yet intimately connected bodies of work.\" - David Goldblatt, July 2014\r\n\r\nOne of the preeminent photographers working today, David Goldblatt has received the Hasselblad Award, the Henri Cartier-Bresson Award and the ICP Lifetime Achievement Award.

By building up then surgically peeling back the layers of his paintings and sculptures, he is looking for a glimpse into past experiences.

These paintings and a new site-specific installation mark a dramatic change from his earlier work, especially his evolving interest in how art’s relationship to architecture is an opportunity to understand how fragmentary perceptions are the grist for memory and behavior.",

Moreover, it demonstrates that Florentine bronze sculpture did not end with Giovanni Battista Foggini, Massimiliano Soldani Benzi, and Antonio Montauti, but Pietro Cipriani this cycle – together with the copies after the Antique recently acquired by the J. Paul Getty Museum and in a private collection in England – it reveals that Pietro Cipriano was the last master of European rank and influence active in this field. Differently from the four copies after the antique from the Macclesfield collection, the six reliefs however are new and highly successful inventions, which were celebrated at the time, as attested, for instance, by copies in Doccia porcelain.",

While the dynamism of Italy’s fashion industry was essential to its post-war recovery and subsequent rise as an industrial power, a preoccupation of its changing society included all areas of design. From the 1950s, Italy established itself as a source of both high design and high fashion, with compelling dialogues between the two. The location of craft specialists near Italy’s manufacturing enters helped to forge the collaborative links that became a hallmark of Italian production.\r\nThe exhibition will feature approx. 100 ensembles both from the V&A’s collections and lenders. Important fashion houses include Valentino, Armani, Gucci, Fendi, Pucci, Prada, Missoni, Dolce and Gabbana, Walter Albini as well as the new generation of fashion talent. Examples of Italy’s tailoring and menswear designs will also be displayed. Fashion accessories such as shoes, handbags and jewelry are also an important part of the story.

    "exhibition_description": "Henri Matisse (French, 1969-1954) was one of the most influential artists of the 20th century, whose stylistic innovations fundamentally altered the course of modern art. In a career spanning six decades, his achievements in painting, sculpture, drawing, graphic arts, book illustration and paper cutouts earned the acclaim of collectors, critics and several generations of younger artists.\r\nMatisse initially trained as a lawyer before developing an interest in art. He moved to Paris to study painting in 1891. He followed the traditional academic path first at the Académie Julian and then at the École des Beaux Arts, but he also discovered a dynamic and experimental contemporary Parisian art scene. He began to experiment with a diversity of styles to create his own pictorial language. In 1905, Matisse exhibited at the Salon d’Automne with André Derain, and their shockingly bold experiments with using color to structure their paintings brought them the derisive nickname “Les Fauves” (Wild Beasts). Across a succession of stylistic periods, Matisse aimed to discover the “essential character of things” through art that expressed balance and serenity, as he explained in his Notes of a Painter (1908).\r\nThis sweeping exhibition features fifty paintings and sculptures and thirty works on paper spanning six decades of Henri Matisse’s prolific career. Drawn entirely from The Baltimore Museum of Art’s permanent collection, one of the most comprehensive collections of Matisse’s work in the world, this exhibition provides a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for a regional community to share in the beauty of such a magnificent body of work.\r\nIn addition to Matisse: Masterworks from The Baltimore Museum of Art  are four exhibitions of outstanding works from the collection of the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, all of them created or inspired by Matisse.\r\nChasing Matisse: American Moderns Under the Influence, Gallery 361\r\nMore Matisse, Please: Drawings and Prints, Gallery 369\r\nMore Matisse, Please: Book Illustration, Gallery 359\r\nMore ",

Siegmann visited Liberia for the first time in 1965 to teach history. In the ensuing decades he lived on and off in Liberia for fifteen years, pursued a graduate degree in African art history at Indiana University, and was a major force behind the development of two museums in Liberia. During this time he developed a life-long passion – and formidable eye – for African art resulting in an extensive personal collection. In 1987 he became the Curator of African Art at the Brooklyn Museum of Art and continued research on his collection. Before he passed away in November 2011, Siegmann – a native of Minneapolis who had maintained strong connections with his hometown – started donating portions of his collection to various museums including the Minneapolis Institute of Arts.\r\nCovering a period from the fifteenth to the late twentieth centuries, with many examples from the nineteenth century, Visions from the Forests: The Art of Liberia and Sierra Leone will showcase approximately seventy-five pieces, created by artists from over a dozen different ethnic groups. Some of the highlights include: a Mano face mask with feathers and shoulder cap; a large horizontal mask from the Loma; a Vai helmet mask by an identified yet unnamed master carver from around 1900; a rare wooden female figure by a Sherbro artist; a brass tortoise cast by the famous Dan caster Ldamie of Gaple; a unique sixteenth century Sapi stone sculpture representing a seated couple; ceremonial horn pendants adorned with silver in which inscriptions in Arabic and Vai have been written; a late eighteenth century side-blown ivory horn from the Krim; a Temne chiefly hat in silver modeled after a fez; and a tie dyed wrapper designed by contemporary artist Christina Tombe.",

    "exhibition_description": "Visions from the Forests: The Art of Liberia and Sierra Leone is the collection brought together between 1965 and 1987 by the late William Siegmann. Siegmann visited Liberia for the first time in 1965 to teach history. In the ensuing decades he lived on and off in Liberia for fifteen years, pursued a graduate degree in African art history at Indiana University, and was a major force behind the development of two museums in Liberia. During this time he developed a life-long passion – and formidable eye – for African art resulting in an extensive personal collection. In 1987 he became the Curator of African Art at the Brooklyn Museum of Art and continued research on his collection. Before he passed away in November 2011, Siegmann – a native of Minneapolis who had maintained strong connections with his hometown – started donating portions of his collection to various museums including the Minneapolis Institute of Arts.\r\nCovering a period from the fifteenth to the late twentieth centuries, with many examples from the nineteenth century, Visions from the Forests: The Art of Liberia and Sierra Leone will showcase approximately seventy-five pieces, created by artists from over a dozen different ethnic groups. Some of the highlights include: a Mano face mask with feathers and shoulder cap; a large horizontal mask from the Loma; a Vai helmet mask by an identified yet unnamed master carver from around 1900; a rare wooden female figure by a Sherbro artist; a brass tortoise cast by the famous Dan caster Ldamie of Gaple; a unique sixteenth century Sapi stone sculpture representing a seated couple; ceremonial horn pendants adorned with silver in which inscriptions in Arabic and Vai have been written; a late eighteenth century side-blown ivory horn from the Krim; a Temne chiefly hat in silver modeled after a fez; and a tie dyed wrapper designed by contemporary artist Christina Tombe.",

This means she draws equally from thrift store treasures, a wry sense of humor, and found objects that only be described as “suburban sublime.” For those already familiar with her work, these newest pieces will show how she is making an important shift to a human-scale and working more quickly. Since her use of art historical concepts such as ready-made and recycling are so elastic she can develop forms that become endearingly awkward and self-effacing. “Feelings” is the head of a sad-eyed dog figurine, the top portion of which seamlessly transitions into her sculpted, oversized lower body. The exaggerated scale is funny and pathetic",

The men that Her has photographed, in the tradition of classical paintings of generals, are veterans of that war—excluded from subsidized health services, refused the right to be buried in national cemeteries, and disqualified from wearing U.S.–sanctioned military uniforms and medals.\r\nHere, they stand proudly. These Hmong Army veterans have awarded one another medals based on their oral testimony. Her sees these portraits as neither advocacy nor criticism. The installation magnifies a particular effort in our common hope to be recognized.",

With more than 12,000 images in the collection of the Department of Photography and New Media, the hard part was choosing one from each year! Some years were easier than others: 1916 offered just five works, while 1993 had 333.\r\n\r\nThe resulting exhibition reveals something wonderfully idiosyncratic: freed from the narrative traditions of photographic history, yet tied to the collecting habits and tastes of MIA curators.\r\n\r\nBut what about the +? The MIA’s interest in photography reaches back to 1903, before this building—or the MIA itself—even existed. Known then as the Minneapolis Society of Fine Art, this precursor held its first photography exhibition in the Minneapolis Public Library at 1834 Emerson Avenue North. It would be another 70 years before the MIA established its Department of Photography, in 1972.\r\nIn the spirit of “100+”, you are invited to share your favorite photos from any year of your life. Simply post your photo to Twitter or Instagram using #tbtMIA. Your photos will appear on a screen outside the Harrison Photography Gallery throughout the run of the exhibition.",

Kaplow focuses on the common chair to bring our attention to the products that fill our home, and asks whether a community can develop around the global reach of a shared commodity. Using ink on paper to conflate chair designs from both ancient China and modern Ikea—which depends on Chinese mass-manufacturing—Kaplow’s techniques of abstraction and photorealism stress the tension of connecting with the unfamiliar.\r\nKaplow also uses video to find connections between cultures, nations, and physical architectures. As part of her 2010 Red Gate International Artists Residency, she traveled to Beijing and recorded Chinese commuters as they passed her in the subway or below her balcony. When covered by projections of Kaplow’s video footage, the gallery walls become windows, and we can see the world as connected by more than our chairs.",

A creative force behind Devo, a punk-era, art-house band, Mothersbaugh has been making art since before the band’s inception. Throughout this time, his work has both embraced handmade qualities and also incorporated the slick elements of consumer culture.\r\nAt once an artist, musician and tinkerer, he offers a key to understanding the current state of art, with its hybridity, subjectivity and fluid boundaries. The intention of this retrospective is to reveal the creative and artistic mind behind what is familiar to many people. The exhibition will feature artworks from the beginning of Mothersbaugh’s career through his most recent work. This retrospective encompasses the most comprehensive presentation of Mothersaugh’s work to date, not only revealing his unique aesthetic sensibility between pop art and comic culture, but also his role as a key figure in establishing the alternative legacy of millennial art.",

But now special new lighting in Gallery 353 is allowing the museum to show these works more routinely. This selection pays tribute to trees, variously interpreted as dancing, frightening, chatty, wily, and close to perfection. Some works entered the collection only in the last several years, including mouthwatering watercolors by Auguste Lepère, Charles Burchfield, and Childe Hassam, and this delicate bit of poetry by the impressive Dutch landscapist Egbert van Drielst.",

    "exhibition_description": "Eugène Delacroix was the very engine of revolution that helped transform the art of French painting in the nineteenth century. At his death in 1863, he was the most revered artist in Paris. The younger generation of painters from Edgar Degas to Vincent van Gogh scrambled to pay homage to his achievement and to explore his aesthetic theories, as articulated in his life’s work, much of which was accessible to the public, and in his incisive critical writings. If he was often described appropriately as the last painter of the Grand Style, he was equally one of the first modern masters and arguably the most influential artist of his epoch.\r\n This exhibition will investigate, through various thematic groupings of pictures, how and why this was so. The themes will range over some of the following: orientalism; color theory; religious and history painting at a crossroads; beasts, flowers and aestheticism; “musical” painting; and the artist’s own unpublished “Dictionary of Art.” \r\nIn addition to Delacroix, the exhibition will include works by Cézanne, Van Gogh, Gauguin, Renoir, and others.\r\nA significant number of paintings from the Minneapolis Institute of Art will form the core of the show, including Delacroix’s Fanatics of Tangiers, generally considered one of the principal masterworks by the artist in North America, van Gogh’s brilliant Olive Trees, and Signac’s initial pointillist work Snow, Boulevard de Clichy.",

    "exhibition_description": "Mountains lie at the very heart of Chinese culture and art. A bridge between the human and transcendental realms, they have provided an enduring source of inspiration for poets, scholars, and artists and remain a potent theme within China’s landscape painting tradition.\r\nThe idea of retreating from society into a life of reclusion in the mountains has a long-standing history in China. The practice thrived in ancient China, in part because it found support in the philosophies of Confucianism, Daoism and later Buddhism. The motivation for reclusion could be spiritual or ethical. For Daoist adherents, the mountains offered the opportunity to encounter immortal beings and were therefore a path to transcendence. For some intellectuals, the politics of the court and the burdens of society or perhaps fame proved unbearable. Retreats built in mountain or streamside settings promised a peaceful and unfettered life in simple circumstances where they could indulge in scholarship and the practice of art. The ethos of reclusion so influenced the Chinese intellectual class that it left an imprint on almost every facet of artistic endeavor. In landscape painting, the theme of reclusion was expressed through diverse imagery, sometimes unprecedented and original, but often based on well-known prototypes and patterns. Among the patterns represented here are “retreat in solitude,” “reclusion in a fishing boat,” “reading in seclusion,” “visiting a recluse,” and “gazing at waterfall.”\r\nDrawn from the collection of the Minneapolis Institute of Art, the works on display span 500 years of Chinese history, from the late Southern Song to the Qing dynasties (13th–early 20th centuries).",

Aquatint, an etching technique developed in the late 18th century, introduces a porous ground to the printing plate through the application of resin that is fused to the plate before it is etched in the acid bath. The inked porous ground produces an effect akin to wash or watercolor, which artists have exploited to dramatic, evocative ends. The show features a range of works, from innovative early examples of the technique by Francisco Goya and Jean-Baptiste Le Prince to haunting, spectacular images from the 20th century by Otto Dix and Pablo Picasso.",

At the same time, global wars, economic depression, and racial and religious conflict produced suffering for many. These turbulent decades prompted insightful, often impassioned, responses from American artists whose perspectives conveyed many of the hopes, dreams, and fears of the public at large. This exhibition presents more than 45 original prints, drawings, and watercolors by such leading figures as John Sloan, George Bellows, Charles Burchfield, Thomas Hart Benton, John Steuart Curry, Grant Wood, Rockwell Kent, Reginald Marsh, Leo Katz, Elizabeth Catlett, Rico Lebrun, Ben Shahn, and many more.",

For Adrià, a native of Barcelona, drawing has been the fundamental tool in defining this activity. Adrià’s complex body of work positions the medium as both a philosophical tool—used to organize and convey knowledge, meaning, and signification as well as a physical object, used to synthesize over 20 years of innovation within the kitchen.

    "exhibition_title": "Seven Masters: 20th-Century Japanese Woodblock Prints from the Wells Collection",
    "exhibition_description": "At the end of the 19th century, demand dropped significantly for the once highly popular traditional Japanese woodblock prints, better known in the West as ukiyo-e. Publishers and artists slowed production and created fewer new designs. Yet what seemed like the end of a unique art form, without parallel in the world, was actually the beginning of another, as the path was cleared for a new kind of print: shin hanga. \r\n\r\nIn the 1910s, a few painters began to design prints that included much stronger references to Western aesthetics, painting styles, and techniques. Spurred on by the entrepreneurial publisher Watanabe Shōzaburō (1885–1962), artists like Hashiguchi Goyō (1880–1921) began to create portraits of beautiful women, prints that early on were particularly cherished by foreign collectors. These shin hanga were produced in unconventional paper formats, different sizes than those typically used for ukiyo-e, signaling a clear break with the past. Also, instead of printing thousands of copies, as was common with ukiyo-e, publishers produced shin hanga in more limited quantities, ranging from editions of 350 to as little as 29.\r\n\r\nSeven Masters focuses on seven artists who played a significant role in the development of the new print and are noteworthy representatives of this new print movement. Drawing from the collection of Ellen and Fred Wells at the Minneapolis Institute of Art, the exhibition features the spectacular beauty portraits of Hashiguchi Goyō, Itō Shinsui (1898–1972), Yamakawa Shūhō (1898–1944), and Torii Kotondo (1900–1976), the striking actors of Yamamura Toyonari (Kōka; 1886–1942) and Natori Shunsen (1886–1960), as well as the evocative landscapes of Kawase Hasui (1883–1957). \r\n\r\nPencil drawings and rare printing proofs offer insights into the production of woodblock prints, and, as these seven artists were painters as well as print designers, a selection of paintings offers a glimpse of their multiple talents.",

    "exhibition_description": "Lindsay Rhyner’s textile wall hangings are loosely based on found-photographs and postcards from the 1940’s. The imagery depicted in the postcards and photographs is of a seemingly idyllic time. Pictures of exotic places, agriculture, war, tourism and monuments were rendered in oversaturated color and rigid composition. A window to a perfect world which never existed.  By translating these worlds into fabric and using reflective materials, like sequins, reflective fabrics, and rhinestones, Rhyner forces us to look beyond the frozen image and to take a closer look at the materiality of the wall hangings themselves.",

By diverting the boundaries of a space, Sexton enables us to mistrust artifice and seek what exists when the seams surrounding us become malleable to our perceptions. Places become like people, with walls that are permeable, fallible, sometimes scarred, yet, deep within lies the perfect ideology of geometry and nature.",

    "exhibition_title": "James Castle: The Experience of Every Day",
    "exhibition_description": "James Charles Castle (1899-1977) was a self-taught American artist who lived his entire life in rural Idaho. Born profoundly deaf, he grew up in a small farming community surrounded by family members (including seven surviving siblings), but remained socially isolated due to his inability to communicate with others. Despite attending school for the hearing-impaired as a child, he never learned to speak or sign. Castle lived at home with his parents until their death, and then with other family members until his own death in 1977. He never married, nor had any children of his own. In addition to farming, his parents owned a small-town general store and operated the local post office. It was in this environment that Castle discovered his need and acumen for personal expression. The materials, subjects, and sentiments of his art were born of everyday life experience. \r\nHis collages, constructions and bound books consist largely of repurposed scrap materials, often stitched together with lengths of string or ribbon, and sometimes combined with hand-drawn designs and lettering. He made countless drawings on waste paper or commercial packaging, using a range of media that included ink made from stove soot and spit, and watercolor solutions he contrived by grinding and soaking color reproductions cut from magazines and other printed material. As a result, Castle’s drawings and constructions possess a material ingenuity and an engaging improvisational spirit that define his creative vision. His work is generally representational, though many of his constructions are highly abstract and only hint at their real-world inspiration. Castle occasionally produced non-representational drawings, whose subjects may in fact be merely unidentified. Above all, his work reveals a compelling and persistent inner need for personal expression. ",

Captain Eastman spent his long assignment transfixed by Native ways, and he produced the most frank and intimate—if slightly romantic—record of Native people in pre-territorial Minnesota. Mia is extraordinarily fortunate that the W. Duncan and Nivin MacMillan Foundation has given Mia 35 of Eastman’s historic watercolors and drawings, most based on his Minnesota sketches. Among these small, detailed gems are Indian Sugar Camp and Gathering Wild Rice, believed to be the first-ever images of harvesting maple syrup and wild rice. Eastman’s quiet observations are especially evident in Dakotah Encampment, which reveals wonderful details of tipi construction.",

Andrus III had a particular passion for these small-scale marvels, and now selected works from his exceptional collection are being unveiled in Gallery 344. They are part of a generous gift of more than 230 works from John and Marion Andrus’s three daughters, Elizabeth, Julie, and Catherine. \r\nThis display focuses on prints from the 16th and 17th centuries. Most are no bigger than a credit card. Some, like Rembrandt’s Goldsmith, have an intimate, personal feel. Other prints began life as ornamental designs for sheaths or brooches. A series of tiny religious scenes by Jacques Callot were meant to be used as paper substitutes for pilgrim badges. The German Kleinmeister, or Little Masters—followers of Albrecht Dürer—executed diminutive gems with uncommon charm, playfulness, and technical refinement, as exemplified by this Italianate nude.

Showcasing her recent work, “New Pictures: Leslie Hewitt, A Series of Projections” features a two-channel film installation, Untitled (Structures) (2012); photographs—A Series of Projections (2010) and Untitled (Abloom) from Blue Skies, Warm Sunlight Studies (2012); and a photolithograph, Flowers (2013).\r\n\r\nUntitled (Structures) responds to an archive of civil rights-era photographs housed at the Menil Collection in Houston. Commissioned by the Menil, the Des Moines Art Center, and the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago, the double channel film installation presents a series of silent vignettes shot at locations in Chicago, Memphis, and the Arkansas Delta—places profoundly influenced by the Great Migration and the Civil Rights Movement—as well as body movements that represent those of black migrants and protesters. Posing critical questions of the historicity and relevance of the archive and documentary photographic modes, Untitled (Structures) explores multiple ideas, exposing the tensions between still photography and the cinematic experiences of moving images, between the corporeal and the architectonic, between the past and the present, and between the physical and the psychological.\r\n\r\nThe high-resolution projectors used in the exhibition are generously provided by Canon U.S.A., Inc.",

Pushing against nostalgia, these pictures renew the question of narrative construction in a photograph of documentary nature, and suggest their relevance in today’s political, social, and racial conflicts.

    "exhibition_description": "Bryant is from Minnesota, yet he has spent a significant amount of time living abroad in Greece, Cuba and China. Life in those countries has allowed him to experience \"otherness\" outside of an American racial black/white binary. Bryant was able to examine how art is manifested in other cultures, and its influence on and reflection of their people. \r\n\r\nFor his MAEP exhibition, Bryant will expand a new body of work based on his experiences abroad. Illustrated in historicized images, paintings, maps, etchings and manuscripts that chronicle the experiences of the time traveler. By re-positioning the protagonist from the role of object to the central subject in history, Bryant questions our own understanding of cultural binaries. By flipping the protagonist from object to subject, we begin to question our interpretation of accepted historical images or objects, while simultaneously questioning the subversive brutality of contemporary human relationships.",

    "exhibition_description": "What if an art installation bent the rules? What if it questioned the norms of museum practice by replacing its traditional white walls with colorful murals? Or combined artworks not because they came from the same time or place, but because, together, they spoke to universal themes of human existence: people, places, and things?\r\n\r\nArtist Dave Muller asks these questions in Now Where Were We?, his temporary re-installation of Mia’s contemporary art galleries. Muller collaborated with Mia’s staff to explore its vast collection, selecting and combining artworks from very different times and places. He then integrated them into the new visual context of his hand-painted murals. Muller’s extensive music collection streams through a listening station in the galleries, adding to the eclectic atmosphere. We hope you’ll consider these artworks in a new way, beyond their original time and place, and join in the conversations that arise from this new configuration.",

    "exhibition_description": "Alison Hiltner views herself as an archaeologist of science fiction, exploring the media landscape of films, television, and video games and intertwining these themes with current scientific inquiry. She merges visual cues from the natural world and fiction to create large-scale sculptural installations. The results confront the viewer with something that appears alien yet undeniably familiar.\r\n\r\nThe central concept throughout Hiltner’s work is a fascination with how science fiction cinema influences our current understanding of scientific research, and how that filter of understanding will affect technological advancement in the future. By maintaining a sense wonder, humor, and a touch of the absurd, she anchors these pieces conceptually in earnest manipulation, driven by a curiosity of the stranger elements of our existence.\r\n\r\nFor her MAEP exhibition, “It Is Yesterday,” Hiltner has created a responsive environment that explores the symbiosis between algae and humans. An installation that’s equal parts experimental laboratory and mechanized environment, it immerses the audience in a landscape influenced by science fiction, yet populated by real organisms, confusing fact and fiction. By forging a personal connection to algae growth, this work provides an intimate approach to climate issues.",

Born in China to Japanese parents, and active professionally in New York and Taipei, Araki created an immense body of ink paintings that reimagined tradition and straddled East and West.\r\n\r\nThis exhibition is organized around five mid-career, large-scale works—monumental compositions, each of which stretches more than 70 feet—depicting landscapes, dragons, snow monkeys, and lotus ponds. Each painting is complemented by early and late works that marry influences as disparate as the eccentric Chinese painter Bada Shanren (c. 1626–1705), the Lithuanian-American artist Ben Shahn (1898–1969), Araki’s mentor, the renowned Chinese traditionalist painter Zhang Daqian (1899–1983), and medieval Japanese Zen painters.",

John Stuart, who served as Superintendent of Indian Affairs for Britain’s southern colonies and was also an owner of enslaved Africans. For over 80 years, the rooms have been interpreted as late-1700s interiors featuring high-style Chippendale and Federal-style American and English furniture and objects.\r\n\r\nThis new temporary exhibition replaces a stylistic approach by reinserting African and Native American presence in these spaces. In the Charleston Drawing Room, Cherokee art of the Colonial era and contemporary Cherokee art that responds to this moment of history reveal stories of diplomatic relations and travel between the Cherokee Nation and the British Crown. In the Charleston Dining Room, West African and African American objects tell important stories of Charleston’s dependence on enslaved West Africans’ indigenous knowledge of rice cultivation for commercial gain and as a source of nourishment during this time—foreshadowing the legacy of African cuisine in contemporary America.\r\n\r\nThis project is part of Living Rooms, an initiative to present Mia’s historic interiors and decorative arts collections in new ways.",

Dating from the 1970s to the early 2000s, these relics of the pre-digital age were collected by Collier, each image discarded by its original owner yet finding its way back to relevance in Collier’s work. The slideshow consists of amateur snapshots of women photographing themselves with film cameras prior to the advent of the digital “selfie.” Instead of circulating on social media, these abandoned images once existed for a private audience. The resulting work is steeped in a deep sense of loneliness, illustrating photography’s contentious relationship to memory, loss, and self-representation.\r\nAnne Collier (b. 1970, Los Angeles), lives and works in New York. Collier received her BFA from the California Institute of the Arts, Valencia in 1993, and her MFA from the University of California, Los Angeles, in 2001.",

Through face-to-face portrait sessions, the artist bonded with her sitters, building a relationship of friendship and mutual trust. The resulting paintings represent the diverse communities that live and work in Phillips and Whittier, some of whom are Latino and Somali immigrants. The exhibition will also feature video documentation of the painting process providing the audience with an intimate window into the community groups portrayed.\r\n\r\nBy representing individuals and communities that are under-represented in the history of art and have traditionally been underserved by public arts institutions, Nisenbaum seeks to empower her sitters and visitors alike, instilling in them an expanded sense of ownership and belonging to the museum. To that end, Cargill Gallery will be reimagined as a platform for dialogue and community exchange for the duration of the exhibition, providing a flexible space for programming by community members themselves.",

Many of their nocturnal soirees were private affairs, hosted in elite homes by invitation only. The Grand Salon from the Hôtel de la Bouëxière will be prepped for one of these exclusive parties with a games table for card-playing (the night-loving aristocrat’s favorite diversion), candlesticks, and the required stimulants: coffee and chocolate. Of course, staying up late meant burning the midnight oil, so artificial lighting with candles and fire increased in importance during this time. New lighting in the Salon will simulate the effects of flickering flames, revealing the warm glow of gilded paneling and metalwork in a “nighttime” setting.\r\n\r\nThis project is part of Living Rooms, an initiative to present Mia’s historic interiors and decorative arts collections in new ways.",

Acting as “windows” on scenes that likely would have remained unseen without the benefits of photographic technology, the images reflect the medium’s ability to turn the familiar or hidden into unfamiliar, thought-provoking, evocative, and even iconic moments. Challenging a linear history of photography that began in the 1820s, this collection suggests the timelessness and timeliness of the images’ subjects as well as the global transmission and dissemination of the medium.",

    "exhibition_description": "A horse is the projection of peoples' dreams about themselves—strong, powerful, beautiful—and it has the capability of giving us escape from our mundane existence.    – Pam Brown\r\n \r\nFor more than 500 years, horses have been favorite subjects for artists and their patrons. In the prints, drawings, and artists’ books featured in this exhibition, horses take on many roles. They carry riders, propel vehicles, run freely through the landscape or within the confines of the race track, battle heroically, and sometimes fall tragically. They are servants, masters, partners, and victims. Just as man has attempted to tame the horse, the horse has transformed man, making him stronger, faster, more commanding. Artists have borrowed attributes of the horse to create new creatures, often endowed with magical powers. Though today horses are seldom part of our daily lives, they are rarely absent from our imaginations.",

    "exhibition_title": "\"I Am Somali\": Three Visual Artists from the Twin Cities",
    "exhibition_description": "In Somalia, poetry has long been the preferred medium for artistic expression—in fact, the country is sometimes called “the land of bards.” This is in part because of Somalia’s long Islamic tradition, which discourages the visual depiction of people while embracing the power of the spoken word. Yet Somali artists have also turned to other media, including drawing, painting, photography, and video.\r\n\r\nThis exhibition celebrates the work of three Somali visual artists from the Twin Cities: Hassan Nor (81), Aziz Osman (69), and Ifrah Mansour (30). Nor and Osman were born in Somalia and grew up there, migrating to the United States in the 1990s after the outbreak of civil war at home. Their drawings and paintings look to the past, depicting life in Somalia before the war and in transit, on the way to their new country. Mansour, on the other hand, was born in Saudi Arabia and raised in Minnesota. Her video addresses the cultural ignorance and stereotypes she encounters in her daily life. All three share stories of exile, memory, identity, pride, and resilience.",

    "exhibition_description": "George Morrison (1919–2000) was a renowned Anishinaabe modernist from Minnesota whose visionary work was inspired by the natural world, a profound sense of place, and Native American thought and culture. Morrison believed that nature, particularly the sky and water, held a spiritual vitality, a transcendent force that could be experienced through an aesthetic rooted in abstraction and surrealism.  Emotive, personal, intuitive, and organic, Morrison’s approach was also deeply introspective, with Minnesota landscapes and the shoreline of Lake Superior serving as his principal subjects. Selected from the holdings of the Minneapolis Institute of Art, this exhibition highlights Morrison’s abiding interest in color, abstraction, the natural world, and creating art on an intimate scale. Featuring drawings in pen and ink, colored pencil, conté crayon, and gouache, the selection also includes several small acrylic horizon paintings.",

    "exhibition_description": "Buddhism has been a dominant religious and intellectual force in China since it arrived from India around 100 C.E. Both literati and professional artists created Chinese Buddhist paintings.\r\nLiterati painters, scholars for whom painting was a form of intellectual and moral cultivation, created meditative scenes by incorporating Buddhist ideas into landscape painting. For painters who followed Chan (Zen) Buddhism, the expressive handling of ink evoked the sudden awareness that comes in moments of insight.\r\nProfessional artists generally focused on figurative paintings, including depictions of buddhas, bodhisattvas (nearly enlightened beings that stay on earth to help people), arhats (the original followers of the Buddha), and eminent monks. During the Qing dynasty (1644­–1911), the imperial patronage of esoteric Buddhism—the primary school of Tibetan Buddhism—resulted in a vast number of religious works in the Tibetan style. These paintings combine Tibetan attention to iconographic detail with Chinese-inspired decorative elements.",

Born near Grand Marais, Minnesota, Morrison trained in Minneapolis before moving to New York in 1943. Immersed in the culture of improvisation and experimentation in New York, Morrison gradually worked on a large scale and made thickly encrusted paintings shimmering with light and energy. This installation places Morrison’s Untitled (1960) painting in dialogue with artists he knew and exhibited with in the 1950s and 1960s, including Philip Guston, Grace Hartigan, and Louise Nevelson. Recently conserved, Morrison’s painting has not been on view at Mia for many decades. This installation reconnects Morrison’s work to midcentury modernism and reaches forward to suggest his legacy. A newly acquired piece by Andrea Carlson (Anishinaabe, Ojibwe, b. 1979), who early on received encouragement from Morrison, will also be on view for the first time.",

Women often engaged with scientific discoveries and cultivated observational skills through embroidery and drawing—common pursuits for women of leisure. The c. 1730 Queen Anne Room will feature works on paper and textiles made by women. The adjoining c. 1740 Georgian Drawing Room will be arranged for a “scientific party” where curious men and women socialized amidst telescopes, microscopes, an electrostatic generator—an experimental instrument that generated an electric charge—and, of course, tea.",

Ringler's compositions place familiar objects (a car, a canoe, a buffet) alongside natural forms rematerialized, like the Mississippi watershed cast in iron, to form a sculptural still life in the gallery. Placed within the context of the museum, Ringler’s exhibition speaks to the human need to preserve objects, protect moments of fragility, and illustrate our deepest potential for compassion.\r\n\r\nRingler’s artistic practice focuses on landscape sculpture and public art installations that engage environmental awareness. She studied at the University of Wisconsin and received her MFA from the University of Texas, Austin. She teaches at the University of Minnesota–Twin Cities and serves on the board of directors of Franconia Sculpture Park. Recent exhibitions include Bascom Art Center, Highlands, North Carolina; Pedvale Open-Air Art Museum, Latvia; and the Weisman Art Museum, Minneapolis. Ringler is a recipient of the 2017 McKnight Fellowship.",

This installation questions that division. It includes works by fiber artists whose formal art studies first centered on painting. There are also works by painters, some who have influenced fabric design, and others who have paid close attention to textile patterns and the relationship of clothing to the female body. Featuring many new additions to Mia’s collection, this display illustrates how artists often think and create outside the categories of art that museums generally like to employ. Among the thirteen artists included are Sheila Hicks, Yayoi Kusama, Marcia Marcus, Elizabeth Osborne, Christina Ramberg, and Shinique Smith.",

At court, women’s attire was highly standardized; outside court, they had greater flexibility to choose styles and designs that matched their personal taste. Robes arranged with medallion designs were considered the most formal. Robes with overall scattered schemes were less formal, and robes with only decorative borders and plain grounds were the least formal. Floral imagery, already popular for hundreds of years, became increasingly realistic at this time. Many of these garments exemplify a fashion trend of the 1800s: cuffs and hems embellished with embroidered bands, which in turn were often edged with strips of brocaded ribbon.",

Brightness gives way to darkness. Abundance yields to scarcity. The objects are cast, quite literally, in a new light.\r\nEach room evokes an aspect of life within China’s imperial palace during the Qing (pronounced “ching”) dynasty, which ruled for more than 250 years, until 1911, and combined power with beauty—a golden age of art. The splendor of royal gatherings. Mystic teachings and the sacred rhythms of nature. And the emperors themselves—their bliss and burdens and occasional desire to escape it all.\r\n\r\n“The reason we work in the theater is to ask, ‘What is it?’ not to say what it is,” says Wilson. And this is the approach he has brought to Mia. Objects as emotion. The exhibition not as explanation, but experience.",

They have worked side by side their entire lives. Their focus on drawing and meticulous, painstaking process sets them apart. Each dedicates hundreds (and sometimes thousands) of hours to a single work, drawing skillfully, obsessively, until pencil has transformed paper into a provocative image rendered with photographic precision.\r\nAlthough the brothers use the same medium (graphite) and technique (photorealist) in their drawings, their subjects and approaches diverge. Bly concentrates on portraiture and nature. He scrutinizes the ordinary, overlooked, and seemingly banal to show such details of life are worthy of appreciation and artistic expression. Rowan focuses on narrative to examine a range of human emotions, a path that can lead to a chilling view of humanity. In their hyper-vivid depictions, both create haunting, memorable, and at times disturbing works of art.\r\nThe exhibition will feature a selection of their drawings, paintings, and works in process.",

Meanwhile, fellow Minnesotan Elizabeth Olds was writing herself into history by helping to transform screenprinting, traditionally a commercial process, into a medium for fine art. Her efforts, part of Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal program of arts patronage, enabled artists to put low-cost art in the hands of a mass audience.\r\n\r\nOlds’s prints used humor, satire, and a socially conscious viewpoint to document American life during the unsettled 1930s. Gág’s work came from a more private place: a spinning wheel, tree, or sleeping cat was enough to ignite her one-in-a-million imagination.\r\n\r\nThis exhibition celebrates these two Minnesota-grown artists with prints, drawings, and preparatory materials for their children’s books.",

This first major U.S. retrospective exhibition of Hagiwara’s work showcases his enormous versatility. More than 30 prints span his early work of the 1950s to the Greek Mythology series in 1965, and from his celebrated series of novel views of Mount Fuji in the 1980s and 1990s to his enormouslylaborious prints of the Face, Memory, and Mandala series.\r\n\r\nThis exhibition will be presented in two rotations: Rotation 1: December 14, 2019 – October 25, 2020.

At Mia, these rooms have traditionally been installed with period-appropriate furniture and paintings to illustrate the tastes of people who resembled John Stuart in their wealth and social station.But in many cases these artworks reveal far more about John Stuart’s world than its fashion sense. For North Americans in the late 1700s and early 1800s—whether free or enslaved, Native American or of African or European descent—life was impacted by a common set of historical forces, albeit in very different ways. These forces—territorial conflicts, international diplomacy, global trade of precious materials, and shifting national identities—are in some ways embodied by the worldly possessions you see before you. The objects expose deeper themes that tell a more complete story of North America and its inhabitants.This Project is part of Living Rooms, an initiative to present Mia’s historic interiors and decorative arts collections in new ways.",

As a member of Mia’s Board of Directors, the St. Paul native relished opportunities to fortify Mia’s collection of modern photographs; when he died in 2012, his generous bequest to Mia included a collection of over 600 photographs. The striking portraits, landscapes, still lifes, and conceptual photographs selected for this exhibition illuminate the breadth of Drake’s remarkable gift to Mia.",

Elaborate and colorful, theatrical costumes were exaggerated versions of real-life attire—familiar yet fantastical—and historical accuracy was secondary to drama and opulence.\r\n\r\nChinese plays are labeled either civil (wenxi) or military (wuxi). Civil plays presented dramas of daily life—romance, intrigue—while military plays focused on battle scenes, heroic victories, and tragedies. The stories mostly familiar. The beautiful spectacle of the costumes and performance was the true appeal of theater.",

Painters took up the brush to create small vignettes of nature in shades of black on paper or silk, inspired by Chinese paintings then being imported to Japan. The expressive potential of ink has meant that the popularity of monochrome bird-and-flower paintings has never waned. This exhibition highlights several dozen monochrome bird-and-flower paintings in a variety of formats, from folding fans to folding screens, from the 1400s to 1700s.",

Born and raised in Minnesota, Muska came out as a lesbian at age 20.  After earning a BFA at Ohio University, she used photography to record her community of “beautiful, strong women, full of love and joy.”  In an era of persistent legal and cultural prejudice against LGBTQ inviduals, documenting her community was a radical act.  Because her photographs could expose her subjects to significant risks, including the loss of employment, child custody, or housing, she developed her own film in a basement darkroom for decades.  The extraordinary photographic record she produced as a part of the women’s land movement in both Minnesota and Oregon, as well as her work as a labor and women’s rights activist, illuminates a new and vital chapter in American history.

    "exhibition_title": "Living Rooms | Turkish Rugs on Tudor Walls: 16th-Century Trade between England and the Islamic World",
    "exhibition_description": "The Ottoman Empire formed in 1299 and lasted more than 600 years, at one time controlling much of Southeast Europe, Western Asia, and North Africa. Also known at the Turkish Empire, it was centered in what is now Istanbul, and loomed large in the imagination of English elites during the height of its influence in the 1500s and 1600s. Indeed, the English often held conflicting views of the “Turks,” as they broadly referred to Muslims of the Ottoman Empire, the Middle East, and North Africa. They were both a trade ally and a menace from the East, an intriguing culture and a threat to Christianity.\r\n\r\nOne way English people encountered Ottoman Muslims was through material objects. The residents of Mia’s Tudor-era manor room might have been part owners of a trading ship, or stockholders in the powerful Levant Company that regulated trade with the Ottoman Empire. They would have owned Ottoman spices, carpets, kitchenware, and books about Islam. Some objects in the room speak to thoughtful engagement with Muslims and Islam, while others were employed as misleading or hateful propaganda.\r\n\r\nIntolerance or Ignorance?\r\n\r\nTudor-era Britons wrestled with their nation’s trade relationship with Muslims, who were considered “heathens” by both the Catholic and Protestant church at the time. Their anxiety is borne out in this exhibition, in racist imagery and Islamophobic language steeped in prejudice and fear—a difficult encounter with hatred that sheds light on the Western world’s history of bias against Muslims. Exploring how cultures encountered each other long ago can prompt us to examine our own biases and how we can better understand other nations and people.\r\n\r\n“Turkish Rugs on Tudor Walls” is co-curated by Dr. Katie Sisneros, Mellon-ACLS Public Fellow, in collaboration with a graduate student research team supported by the University of Minnesota’s Consortium for the Study of the Premodern World: Alyssa Gregory, Ashley Patton, and Noam Sienna. Thank you to our academic and community advisers: Dr. Nabil Matar, Dr. Wadad ",

Books and language lie at the heart of her practice, one informed by an abiding fascination with the personal and collective expression of memory. Bart describes herself as a cultural storyteller, drawing on historical events, literary sources, and other narratives to shape meaning and engender empathy for her subjects. Conceptually rich and aesthetically refined, her books and works on paper are highly original evocations of the human condition. This solo presentation includes examples of Bart’s artist’s books, drawings, collages, editioned prints, and related objects representing three decades of the artist’s career.",

Through costumes, props, sets, and other devices, these photographers present expansive, critical views of the history of the medium—and, in turn, of their roles as authors of historical narratives.",

    "exhibition_description": "Perhaps no other subject has been so well documented as the lives of children. The first text message to include a photographic image was a birth announcement; today, snapshots of children, teens, and young adults are among the most widely shared images across digital platforms. Photographic images of children have sparked some of the most contentious conversations in contemporary times and raise new and pressing concerns regarding privacy in the age of social media. Yet what kids think, feel, and understand about themselves as represented within the medium plays a far less prominent role in these debates. What do young people perceive when they see photographs of other kids, or of themselves? What is it like for them to hold a camera and to photograph themselves, their peers, and the world around them?\r\n\r\n“Just Kids” is an exhibition of photographs of and by children, teens, and young adults, organized in partnership with middle and high school students. A collaboration among colleagues in the Minneapolis Public School District and the Center for Empathy and the Visual Arts and the Departments of Photography and New Media and Learning Innovation at the Minneapolis Institute of Art, the exhibition offers a fresh perspective on the work of photographers including Lewis Hine, Dawoud Bey, Rania Matar, and Carmen and Alec Soth.",

    "exhibition_description": "Held once every 10 years, “Foot in the Door” is an open exhibition for all Minnesota artists. Now marking its fourth decade, this exhibition celebrates the talent, diversity, and enthusiasm of Minnesota’s visual artists. This is an important event for the arts community and a great opportunity for artists to display their work at Mia. The sole curatorial criteria? Each submission must fit within one cubic foot.\r\n\r\nNew this year, the exhibition is going virtual! In order to prioritize safety, this exhibition will be completely digital to accommodate the huge number of participating artists and visitors.\r\n\r\nHistory of “Foot in the Door” Exhibitions\r\nThe first “Foot in the Door Show” was the brainchild of the Artist Panel of the Minneapolis Artist Exhibition Program (MAEP), a curatorial program of Mia dedicated to exhibiting and supporting artists living and working in Minnesota. Early MAEP critics had expressed concern that the artist-run program would “let anyone into the museum.” The panel’s response was to do just that—invite all Minnesota artists to join the “Foot in the Door Show,” as long as each work was no larger than one cubic foot.\r\n\r\nIn 1980, the first “Foot in the Door” featured work by 740 artists. It was a fantastic success—a whirlwind of images and ideas coalescing into one gallery. And so was born an arts community event. In 1990, “The Other Foot in the Door Show” grew to include works by nearly 900 artists. By 2000, the exhibition featured the work of over 1,700 artists. In 2010, “Foot in the Door 4” officially became the state’s largest art exhibition, presenting nearly 5,000 works; these included video and multimedia works.",

This exhibition will feature a selection of more than 60 artists’ books and original prints by prominent European, Japanese, and American artists and writers, reflecting Kosmas’s wide-ranging interests in art, poetry, and classical literature. The display includes important works by Joan Miró, Sigmar Polke, Georg Baselitz, Richard Hamilton, Shinro Ohtake, Federico García Lorca, Samuel Beckett, Josef Albers, Jim Dine, Jasper Johns, Betye Saar, and the German book artist Veronika Schäpers, among many others.",

She is dedicated to maintaining collective memory for African-descended ancestors who defied the constraints of a racist society. A guiding motto for her life’s work is “Save Me From My Amnesia.” \r\n\r\n\r\nThis exhibition includes many works from Frazier’s Target Series, in which the artist explores the concept of the target from multiple perspectives: Black people as targets of unjust violence and suspicion, but also of love and affection. The bullseye is a recurring motif in this series. \r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to Frazier, “This exhibition continues my work and conversations, concerned with equity and justice, called The Quilted Chronicles and its Target Series. It examines the lives and legacies of African-descended people, including children and their communities across centuries of memory, places, and activism.”\r\n\r\n\r\n<i>Freedom Rising</i> is part of a larger initiative, <i>We Are The Story</i>, organized by the Women of Color Quilters Network (WCQN) and the Minneapolis-based Textile Center, and hosted by arts spaces across the Twin Cities. WCQN founder Carolyn Mazloomi conceived of <i>We Are The Story</i> when Minneapolis became an epicenter for nationwide protests following the police killing of George Floyd. In this exhibition, Frazier’s quilt “Barricades: I Am the Story (CAUTION)” was created in the weeks following Floyd’s death. ",

It was a space in which women gathered or sat alone to work, or to pursue leisurely activities such as reading, writing, sewing and playing music. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe furniture, artworks, and antiquities found within a noblewoman’s bedroom reflected her social status and showed her to be educated and well-read. But they also very much reflected her reality as a woman living in a man’s world, from a dressing table at which she prepared herself for the male gaze, to a bed that signaled her position as the legitimate partner to her husband.

Richly decorated lacquer wares often invoke themes and ideas meant to bring wealth, health, moral ethics, good luck, longevity, and even immortality to their owners—and also communicate their wealth and status.

He thought of himself as an author who drew—a conceptual artist. \r\n\r\n\r\nBorn in Romania, Steinberg studied architecture in Milan and contributed cartoons to student journals. In 1941, Fascist anti-Semitic laws caused him to flee Europe. By the time he arrived in New York in 1942, his drawings had already appeared in several American periodicals, including <i>The New Yorker</i>. He soon entered the U.S. Naval Reserve, joining the Office of Strategic Services, precursor of the Central Intelligence Agency. He served in China, North Africa, and Italy, returning to Washington, D.C. in 1944.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll of this gave Steinberg a healthy distrust of power, authority, and even perception. After the War, he poured his energy into his art. He became famous for destabilizing his audience, reorienting them to his off-kilter point of view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<i>This installation celebrates The Saul Steinberg Foundation’s gift of eight works, giving Mia a representative selection from his mature career.</i>",

The accompanying album grew from Mkali’s in-depth research on the work of each artist, and approaches their individual visual practice as a means to access and articulate a collective Black consciousness that transcends time and space. \r\n\r\nHere, images, words, and music combine to explore themes of identity, culture, spirituality and power through the embodiment of Black lived experience.  As Chaka Mkali explains: \r\n\r\nRituals of Resilience <i>is about the act of survival under intense pressure and heat. A place to hide when being in your body isn’t safe. A reimagining of new worlds and possibilities.

    "exhibition_description": "This exhibition focuses on four remarkable printmakers working in Italy around the year 1600. Each took a different path. Two were brothers, Agostino and Annibale Carracci. Promoting the study of live models and nature, they had a profound impact on artistic trends in Italy. Yet, their engagements with printmaking diverged. Agostino was a prolific, highly skilled professional engraver. Annibale preferred to spend his time making paintings, but for his limited output of prints he adopted the more intuitive technique of etching to produce works of exceptional sensitivity. Camillo Procaccini spent even less time on printmaking, but his few etchings resulted in visionary productions with powerfully emotional content. Andrea Andreani devoted his career to translating the works of other artists into complex woodcuts, sometimes of remarkable size. Several of the prints in this exhibition are here making their first appearance in Mia’s galleries.",

    "exhibition_description": "On March 24, 2020, Minneapolis-based artist Piotr Szyhalski embarked on a daily drawing practice responding to the COVID-19 pandemic as it unfolded in real time. What began as a way for the artist to share observations of life in lockdown and the pain caused by the pandemic quickly became a daily exercise of chronicling his thoughts and feelings and reconciling them with the changes being wrought in the world. \r\n\r\nCOVID-19: Labor Camp Report consists of 225 drawings created over eight months that fall under Szyhalski’s ongoing artistic framework, Labor Camp. New drawings were posted daily on Instagram, serving as a witness to the unfolding crisis and a record of time, both labored and lost. \r\n\r\nSzyhalski’s work addresses themes ranging from time, home, and resilience to misinformation, greed, authoritarianism, and police brutality. The series’ bold messages and images call us to action, ask us to question what is happening in our world, and most importantly, inspire hope and solidarity. \r\n\r\nWhile the pandemic is far from over, we hope COVID-19: Labor Camp Report offers you an opportunity to reflect on both the events of the past year and your own experiences of this turbulent moment.

    "exhibition_description": "<i>“A bridge divides what is “above” the bridge, what is “below” the bridge, what is “before” the bridge and what is “after” the bridge, but at the same time it brings totality and turns it into a neighborhood.”</i>\r\n– Siah Armajani\r\n\r\nIn 1960, at the urging of his family, Siah Armajani (Iranian American, 1939-2020) left his native Iran for the United States, landing in St. Paul where his uncle taught at Macalester College. The artist was an activist at a time of political upheaval in his native country and, for him, immigration was a political act. \r\n\r\nThe installation in this rotunda celebrates an important facet of Armajani’s career: the act of bridging. Ironically, bridges emphasize divisions even as they create connections. As an immigrant, Armajani understood his status as a metaphorical bridge between two cultures, and between two locations. For Armajani, the questions of citizenship and culture are deeply embedded in his works.",
