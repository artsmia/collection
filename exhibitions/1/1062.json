To the west of Fort Belknap lies the Blackfeet Indian Reservation, and to the north into Canada is the Cree tribe. This “triangle” of tribal groups influenced each other’s artwork based on color, technique, and design. The exhibition will explore the artistic and cultural relationships between these tribes.",
