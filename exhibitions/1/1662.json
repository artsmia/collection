  "exhibition_description": "James Holmberg believes that art gives form to human experience. By building up then surgically peeling back the layers of his paintings and sculptures, he is looking for a glimpse into past experiences. Unfinished wood frames, sheets of plastic, and raw building materials, expertly and quickly composed, have a strong visual language but they also show Holberg's interest in concepts of absence, transparency and recovery. These paintings and a new site-specific installation mark a dramatic change from his earlier work, especially his evolving interest in how artâ€™s relationship to architecture is an opportunity to understand how fragmentary perceptions are the grist for memory and behavior.",
