  "exhibition_description": "A beautiful display of decorative bindings by noted French, Belgian, English, and American artists and designers. Most are from the golden age of fine binding, 1920–1960, but with John Graham’s sensational cover for Picasso’s illustrated edition of Balzac’s Chef d’oeuvre inconnu we see the shift to a new era exemplified by the work of Anselm Kiefer and Jim Dine.",
