  "exhibition_title": "New Pictures 2: Marco Breuer",
  "exhibition_description": "Breuer removes both the camera and the traditional image. Instead, he strips photography to its essential materiality, and presents photographs that reveal physical actions on the surface of the light-sensitive paper. This gallery rotation is divided into two parts. Opening in February, Breuer will present selections of old and new works; then in mid-March, he will reorganize the gallery into a space that resembles a darkroom, emphasizing the artistâ€™s process of creating a picture.",
