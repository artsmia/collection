  "exhibition_description": "“Coming Out Party” will showcase new multimedia wok that includes ready-made and fabricated conceptual art pieces Broc Blegen has meticulously copied from original works of art. They are attributed to the original artists but have become part of his personal art collection; it’s his way of living with compelling artworks without the prohibitive cost of purchasing the originals. Blegen has included many familiar names in his collection, especially those artists interested in identity politics, such as Glenn Ligon, Jonathan Horowitz, and Jenny Holzer. The works in the show will provoke interesting questions about religion, gay rights, and the economics of art patronage and collecting.",
