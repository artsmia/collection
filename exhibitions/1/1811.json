  "exhibition_description": "Amy Toscani's sculptures have been carefully churned through a distinct Midwestern aesthetic. This means she draws equally from thrift store treasures, a wry sense of humor, and found objects that only be described as “suburban sublime.” For those already familiar with her work, these newest pieces will show how she is making an important shift to a human-scale and working more quickly. Since her use of art historical concepts such as ready-made and recycling are so elastic she can develop forms that become endearingly awkward and self-effacing. “Feelings” is the head of a sad-eyed dog figurine, the top portion of which seamlessly transitions into her sculpted, oversized lower body. The exaggerated scale is funny and pathetic",
