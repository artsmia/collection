  "exhibition_description": "“Isohyet, Isopleth” is the second collaborative installation by Katelyn Farstad and David Frohlich. The title of the exhibition is borrowed from meteorological terms for lines on a map that are drawn in order to connect two or more points that share similar data. For two artists who are working together on a single exhibition, they are terms that allude to what might happen when different work styles merge in the space of a single exhibition. This show will be comprised of new paintings, prints, and sculptures, in various media. And through these works, audiences will be able see how their exhibition showcases their expanded practice and how they use concepts of idle time and desperation in their work. Both Farstad and Frohlic have exhibited extensively in the Twin Cities, including the Soap Factory, Art of This, and They Won’t Find Us Here. ",
