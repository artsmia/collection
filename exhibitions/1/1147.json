  "exhibition_description": "Each individual has their own story, but these stories are made unique by our surroundings both natural and man-made and by the burden of what we hide and what we hope to present. Jennifer Davis, Erika Olson, Terrance Payne, and Joe Sinness create work that focuses on self-image and the desire to create order where nature would have it otherwise. \r\nDavis’s paintings pick up where her subjects trails of thought drop off. The pastel images create a surface veneer of innocence and charm that hints at darker truths beneath the surface. Olson’s drawings and sculptures question the human impulse to clean up and arrange nature and their need to immortalize once-living objects. Payne’s oil pastels use narrative elements and line and color to capture awkward moments in life’s pursuits. Sinness uses colored pencil and sculpture is a personal examination of queer domesticity using fable, history and unconfined possibility as visual metaphor.",
