  "exhibition_description": "In the 1960s, top textile design firms such as Heal’s of England and Marimekko of Finland sold the most daring, lively and trend-setting patterns produced during the decade. Designers Lucienne Day, Howard Carter, Maija Isola and Marjatta Metsovaara abstracted motifs from the natural world in their bold graphic designs, and employed energetic colors that infused youthful energy. Magnifying Nature explores these gigantic patterns through a selection of screen-printed textiles from the MIA’s collection and examples of clothing from the Goldstein Museum of Design at the University of Minnesota.",
