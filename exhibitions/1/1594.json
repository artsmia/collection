  "exhibition_description": "Given the sheer and varied amount of antiquity and daily visitors in the MIA, Allen Brewer feels compelled to document the MIA visitors' perceptions of art and experience. To do so he will paint, draw and sculpt their descriptions of a (personally important) piece of art from the MIAâ€™s collection. The outcome of this endeavor is not only an exhibition, but more importantly: an unvarnished series of interpretations that deal with the psychological phenomenon of selected memory and perception.\r\nBrewer will invite visitors to fill out a simple description form, a request to isolate one piece within the entire collection that has a personal resonance, and then put it into words. Patrons will fill out the description form, which will be provided at the entrance of each gallery. He will collect the forms each week and create replica of the works, based on the descriptions, to be executed in his studio. The editing process of the pieces will be organic and judicious and in consideration of the MAEP gallery space.The weight, history and origin of words will alone dictate the outcome of each piece.",
