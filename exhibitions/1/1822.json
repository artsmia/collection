  "exhibition_title": "Revealing the Body: The Art of Anatomy",
  "exhibition_description": "During the Renaissance, the advent of printmaking and a new interest in anatomical science converge in representing man for the beauty of his proportions and for the mechanical perfection of his inner structure. Famous artists illustrated the studies of physicians, and dissections became the theater of a new empirical approach to anatomy. In this exhibition, precious, rare volumes from the early 16th to the 18th century, on loan from the Wangensteen Bio-Medical Library, join artistsâ€™ manuals, drawings, and prints from the MIA Prints & Drawing collection, and a skeleton and skulls from the Science Museum of Minnesota, to celebrate the glory of the human body.",
