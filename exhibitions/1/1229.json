  "exhibition_description": "The Ricci Map is the first map in Chinese to show the Americas, and the first printed map to incorporate both Eastern and Western cartography. This large scale map, 12 1/5 ft x 5 ½ ft, was created in 1602 by a visiting Italian-born Jesuit priest, Matteo Ricci, and thought to be commissioned by the court of Emperor Wanli. This is the first time the map is on display in North America. The Ricci Map will be shown at the Library of Congress in Washington DC (January 12 – April 10, 2010) and the Minneapolis Institute of Arts (May 15 – August 29, 2010).",
