  "exhibition_title": "Tokaido Road: Gus Foster and Ando Hiroshige",
  "exhibition_description": "In 1832 Ando Hiroshige traveled the Tokaido, the roadway linking the historic capital of Kyoto with Shogun’s court in Edo. Based on sketches made along the way, Hiroshige later created one of the world’s most celebrated and artistically influential series of woodblock prints. Nearly 160 years later, Gus Foster, an American panoramic landscape photographer, was determined to retrace Hiroshige’s footsteps. His 360° photographs, taken while walking the entire 306 mile route, strikingly document Japan’s metamorphosis in the twentieth century. This exhibition paired each artists’ conception of the fifty-three “stations” of the Tokaido, revealing not only radical changes in Japan’s topography, but also the vast differences between artists’ inspiration, materials and creative interpretation.",
