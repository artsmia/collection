  "exhibition_description": "This exhibition showcases approximately 90 original prints, drawings, collages, books, and other works on paper by leading American and European artists, ranging in date from 1965 to 2011. All of the works to be shown were acquired by the MIA through recent gifts or bequests from individuals, businesses, and other organizations. Many of the editioned prints and artists’ books were produced in collaboration with nationally prominent print workshops and publishers. \r\nThe exhibition is designed to acknowledge and celebrate the generosity of our collecting community, while underscoring their allegiance to the museum and support of the MIA’s public mission. Major donors to be represented in the show include Bob and Mary Mersky (gifted anonymously), Bob and Carolyn Nelson, Dar Reedy, Kate Butler Peterson, and the family of Mary H. Dayton. Other important donors include Barbara Kaerwer, Donna and Cargill MacMillan, Michael Root, Martin Weinstein, Dan Avchen, Roman Verostko (given anonymously), David and Mary Parker, Tom Rassieur, Mary Ryan Gallery, G & K Services, National Academy of Arts and Letters, Well Fargo Bank, among others.
