  "exhibition_description": "Great art is being made right here and now in the Great Lakes. This exhibition presents fourteen of the regionâ€™s most important artists who use wit, critique, warmth, color, imagination, and beauty to celebrate, challenge, and expand our views of Native art.\r\nThese artists are boldly tackling universal issues of humankind, ideas about truth, life, justice, community and self. They also chronicle personal and social histories, biographies, activating and affirming aspects of their communities and selves. Each artist pushes through surfaces and some of our expectations of Native art, encouraging viewers to experience moments of revelation through the beauty of their work.",
