This exhibition pairs closely related objects that reveal stages of the creative process and the evolution of artistic thoughts. Visitors will also see several of the MIAâ€™s remarkable new acquisitions, including masterpieces by artists such as Rembrandt, James McNeill Whistler, and Chuck Close.",
