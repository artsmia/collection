  "exhibition_description": "This installation features a selection of more than fifty drawings, prints, and artists’ books that demonstrates the persistent interest in abstraction and non-objective art among modern and contemporary artists working in the postwar era. The works on view were drawn entirely from the museum’s permanent collection and range from Jackson Pollack’s rare early experimental etchings to Robert Motherwell’s dynamic gestural color prints to Brice Marden’s monochromatic minimalist abstractions. The installation includes examples by Willem de Kooning, Grace Hartigan, Helen Frankenthaler, Philip Guston, Joan Mitchell, Cy Twombly, Beauford Delaney, Richard Diebenkorn, Louise Bourgeois, Sam Francis, John Newman, Mel Kendrick, Julie Mehretu, and others.",
