  "exhibition_description": "Art historian Alfred Moir (1924-2010) of Santa Barbara has bequeathed his superb collection of art to the Minneapolis Institute of Art. The gift, which comprises over 250 works, includes drawings, watercolors, paintings, and prints. It is particularly rich in Italian old master drawings, with rare and outstanding works by such artists as Domenico Beccafumi, Annibale and Ludovico Carracci, Salvator Rosa, Giambattista and Giandomenico Tiepolo, and Federico Zuccaro, and will enrich the MIAâ€™s holdings in this area exponentially. Alfred Moir was born and raised in Minneapolis, but spent most of his life in southern California. A specialist in 17th-century art, he was a professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, where he taught for almost 30 years and retired emeritus in 1991. A selection of works from his collection will be featured in this exhibition.",
