  "exhibition_title": "Seven Billion: Gregory Fitz",
  "exhibition_description": "This exhibition will be the debut of Gregory Fitz’s ambitious 3-part installation. Comprised of day-glo gestural landscapes, paintings made after Ansel Adams photographs, and cinder block table sculptures, “Seven Billion” is a response to the aesthetic projects of modern art and architecture. It’s no accident that Fitz’s work is made from economical materials such as insulation foam and chip board, or that he works so quickly. By doing so he wants to leave his decision making process visible and make a counter-point to the legacy of modern painters and sculptors. This leaves his work wide open for questions about the sacred value given art, the environmental concerns of art making, and the emphasis placed on craft and presentation. Fitz’s work has been part of group exhibitions at Form+Content, the Soap Factory and Weisman Art Museum.",
