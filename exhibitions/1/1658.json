  "exhibition_description": "Let’s face it: men’s fashion is pretty boring. But, it wasn’t always so. There was an age when men used their clothing to stand out rather than to fit in. Often that meant ruffles, embroidery, wigs, slashed sleeves, stuffed shirts, jerkins, leggings, jewels, and cod pieces. This exhibition may inspire you to clear your closet of muted garb to make room for a little self-expression.",
