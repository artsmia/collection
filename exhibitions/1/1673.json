  "exhibition_description": "Mathew Zefeldt’s brightly colored acrylic paintings of 16-bit graphics and textures are appropriated directly from vintage video games he played as a teenager, classics such as DOOM, Super Mario Brothers, and Castle Wolfenstein. The themes of life and death, both real and virtual, are repeated throughout his work, as seen in his use of traditional memento mori, such as funerary reliefs and vanitas paintings. It may appear that the bricks and hero’s face in “When You’re Dead, You’re Dead” are cut, then pasted, but each detail is meticulously handpainted. Gallery walls covered floor to ceiling with sheets of 16-bit brick vinyl wallpaper will complement the paintings.",
