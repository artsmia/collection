  "exhibition_description": "Artist’s books emerged as an art form in the late nineteenth century, and have since become repositories for unbounded artistic imagination. The chance to interpret a favorite text with their own vision is, for many artists, irresistible. The artist’s books exhibited here—spanning more than a century—display a unique commingling of words and picture on the same page, from Pierre Bonnard’s exquisitely daring Parallèlement to Donald Baechler’s quizzical Double Whammy. \r\nThe Minneapolis Institute of Arts is committed to continually strengthening its collection of artist’s books, now numbering more than 600 works housed in the Department of Prints and Drawings. This exhibition presents a selection of recent and important additions to the permanent collection. As these books demonstrate, Greek poetry can provoke an artist’s imagination as readily as a modern-day fairy tale. The artist and author may be friends—like Sonia Delaunay and Jacques Damase—or the artist may take on the dual role of author and illustrator, as Hans Arp and Mark Beard do here.\r\nExciting, experimental, unexpected—the artist’s book format signifies, above all, collaboration between publisher and printer, image and text, high art and craft. The possibilities for expression ensure that all will persist in meeting on the same page for a long time to come.",
