  "exhibition_title": "We Believe in Some Thing: Roxanne Jackson",
  "exhibition_description": "Roxanne Jacksonâ€™s sculptural installations explore the duality of human nature through the metamorphosis of humans and animals. Her installations are macabre scenarios of predator vs. prey, good vs. evil, instinct and survival. Primarily a ceramicist, Jackson is experimenting with materials: glossy ceramic mouths pushing out of suede covered head forms or translucent rubber lit from within to suggest living, pulsing flesh. Her outdoor scenes filled with glowing eyed, hyenas and their victims are like stepping into the middle of the darkest of fairy tales.",
