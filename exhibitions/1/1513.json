  "exhibition_description": "Rembrandt's artistic output was by no means confined to painting. In fact, many consider him the greatest printmaker of all time. Concurrently with \"Rembrandt in America,\" the MIA will present an exhibition of the master's etchings. From quick sketches to elaborate baroque masterpieces, Rembrandt produced an astonishingly imaginative and diverse body of work. He studied beggars in the street, loved ones in his home, and unforgettably his own likeness--sometimes growling at us, sometimes costumed as a dandy, sometimes displaying full awareness of his own limitations. He recorded the world around him, from humble animals to majestic trees to dilapidated farmhouses. He reimagined the stories of the Bible, each time endowing the scene with drama or tender human emotion. This exhibition shows the mind of a genius at work.",
