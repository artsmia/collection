  "exhibition_title": "Venice on Paper",
  "exhibition_description": "As a maritime power at the heart of international trade and travel, Venice has been an important cultural center since the Middle Ages, inspiring both native and visiting artists to create exceptional and unprecedented works of art. Described as the \"Queen of the Adriatic\" with its maze of canals and confluence of Byzantine, Arab, and European architecture, Venice has also been a favorite subject for artists as they have strived to capture the city's unique character and beauty. From Renaissance woodcuts designed by Titian to Venetian views by Canaletto and Whistler, \"Venice on Paper\" explores the city through the graphic arts, bringing together five centuries of original prints, drawings, books, and photographs, all made in or about this enchanting \"floating\" city.",
