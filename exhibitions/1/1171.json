  "exhibition_description": "Satyrs—half man, half goat. Centaurs—half man, half horse. Tritons—half-man, half-fish. They and their female counterparts are known to cavort in the woods and wreak havoc on the seas. Yet they also have their civilized side—raising families, attending parties, playing music, worshiping, and even providing artistic inspiration. So, in the interest of survival, we survey images of composite creatures from the Renaissance, the Baroque, and the Rococo eras of art.",
