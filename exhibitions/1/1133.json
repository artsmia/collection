  "exhibition_description": "What do we mean when we say “good design”? Do we know it when we see it? When we sit on it? This exhibition takes a look at the meaning of good design though the examination of just one form over the course of more than 300 years – the chair. From the basic Tudor to Phillippe Starck’s Louis Ghost Armchair for Kartell, we will explore in just twenty-one chairs how designers over time have reconciled the desire for design with the basic need to find a place to sit. This exhibition is held in conjunction with the Minneapolis Institute of Arts 2010 Antiques and Design Fair, September 24-26, at the St. Paul Armory. ",
