  "exhibition_title": "Albrecht Dürer and the Prints of the Danube School",
  "exhibition_description": "This exhibition highlighted the artists of the Danube School who lived and worked by the Danube River from Regensburg to Vienna in the early 16th-century. The prints of the Danube School are characterized by a profound sensitivity to nature. Landscape and atmospheric elements were used to an unprecedented degree to emphasize subject and mood, while the structure of growing, organic things governed the compositions. It was the Danube School which first introduced into Western Art the idea that pure landscape was a subject worthy of representation. Artists highlighted in the exhibition included Albrecht Dürer, Albrecht Altdorfer, Lucas Cranach, and Augustin Hirchvogel.",
