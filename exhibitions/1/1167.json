  "exhibition_title": "Saints and Sinners: Women in Renaissance Prints",
  "exhibition_description": "Women in the Bible and in legends about saints were depicted frequently in Renaissance art to portray contemporary ideas about the ideal woman, almost invariably by male artists. In this exhibition, 22 prints are examined from a feminist perspective, stressing the womanâ€™s subservient role in 15th and 16th century Europe, but also the negative perception of women as immoral temptresses. In some examples, the overt moralistic message is tempered with erotic overtones. \r\nThe works in this exhibition were made by Italian, German, French, Dutch and Flemish artists at a time when printmaking became a common art form. The profusion of religious prints and reproductions by copyists enabled the wide dissemination of images that supplemented the religious education and personal devotion of the viewer, while also upholding strict gender roles.",
