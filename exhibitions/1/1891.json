  "exhibition_description": "The need for sleep is a simple fact of being human, but the way in which we choose to perform this pleasurable activity varies enormously depending on what country you live in and the time period in which you live. Throughout the centuries the sleeping chamber - be it a wood-paneled suite in a castle, a felt tent on the steppe, or a mud and rattan hut in Africa - has been adorned according to local tradition and personal preference. This exhibition will include blankets and bed coverings from more than a dozen countries worldwide, from Mali to Sweden to Indonesia.",
