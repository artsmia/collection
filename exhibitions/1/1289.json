  "exhibition_description": "This exhibition showcases the premier wood art collection of Minneapolitans David and Ruth Waterbury, which is considered one of the best in the country. The Waterburys have embraced the evolution of the field and its artists for twenty-five years, collecting pieces that range from exquisitely turned bowls, to objects conceived around irregularities within the material, to works that explore imaginative ways to manipulate the medium.\r\nThe exhibition includes approximately 80 pieces of wood art, representing the changing approaches to the medium during the past twenty-five years, from simple turned vessels to sculpted and constructed works. The Waterbury collection includes works by many prominent artists in the field, both nationally and internationally, including William Hunter, Ron Kent, Michelle Holtzapfel, Robyn Horn, Robert Stocksdale, Michael Mode, Alan Stirt, Hayley Smith, and Todd Hoyer.
