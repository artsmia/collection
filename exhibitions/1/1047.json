  "exhibition_title": "Josef Sudek and Czech Photography",
  "exhibition_description": "Josef Sudek (1896-1976) is Czechoslovakia’s most well-known and influential creative photographer. He worked from the 1910s through the 1960s, producing ethereal landscapes, modernist still lifes, and sweeping panoramas of the city of Prague. Every subsequent Czech photographer acknowledged Sudek’s pioneering work and contributed, in their own way, to the rich photographic legacy of their country. Among them were the modernists Frantisek Drtikol and Jaromir Funke, the surrealist Eva Fuka, and the contemporary figure-photographer Jan Saudek. These and other individuals working in what is now the Czech Republic created one of the strongest contributions to twentieth-century photography in all of Europe. The exhibition will include approximately 75 photographs drawn entirely from the MIA’s holdings and the local collection of Harry Drake.",
