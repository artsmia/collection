  "exhibition_title": "The Nabis",
  "exhibition_description": "In 1889, a group of young artists banded together in Paris and called themselves the Nabis, from the Hebrew word for “prophets.” Included in this group were Pierre Bonnard, Edouard Vuillard, Paul Ranson, Paul Sérusier, Maurice Denis, Félix Vallotton, Ker-Xavier Roussel, and Aristide Maillol. They sought to integrate art with life and move beyond what they perceived as the limits of Impressionism. Although the Nabis were trained as painters, they applied their talents to decorative objects and home interiors, theater design and programs, book and magazine illustration, as well as posters and prints. This installation highlighted a selection of their graphic works culled from the permanent collection.",
