  "exhibition_description": "The rediscovery of six bronze reliefs allegorically representing the Times of Night and Day by Giovanni Casini and Pietro Cipriani is the largest and most important ensemble of Florentine bronze sculpture to come to light in a century. At the end of the period known as the ‘Twilight of the Medici’ (exhibition title, Detroit 1974), this iconographically unusual ensemble refers back to Michelangelo’s cycle in the New Scristy of San Lorenzo, and to several other painted and sculpted masterworks of the Baroque period. Moreover, it demonstrates that Florentine bronze sculpture did not end with Giovanni Battista Foggini, Massimiliano Soldani Benzi, and Antonio Montauti, but Pietro Cipriani this cycle – together with the copies after the Antique recently acquired by the J. Paul Getty Museum and in a private collection in England – it reveals that Pietro Cipriano was the last master of European rank and influence active in this field. Differently from the four copies after the antique from the Macclesfield collection, the six reliefs however are new and highly successful inventions, which were celebrated at the time, as attested, for instance, by copies in Doccia porcelain.",
