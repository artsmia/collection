  "exhibition_description": "\r\nMichael Kareken latest body of work tackles the urban landscape, specifically the industrial recycling plants outside his studio window. His paintings are inspired by the never ending piles and constant movement of Rock-Tenn paper recycling plant and the American Iron metal scrap yard he finds metaphoric associations with life and death, growth and decay, order and entropy, structure and chaos. For the MAEP show, Kareken is creating these paintings on a grandiose scale, creating wall size vistas of these plants.\r\n\r\nTetsuya Yamada, on the other hand, works with the industrial landscape of production. Yamada’s work explores the intersection of ideas about the nature of art, craft, machine, and industry. Yamada now delves into the repetition and mundane activities of city life, specifically riding the train during his commutes in his native Tokyo. His installation will explore the way the human mind reacts to passive and repetitive acts, how our mind comes to accept the continuous rhythms of sights and sounds",
