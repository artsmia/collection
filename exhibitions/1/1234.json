  "exhibition_title": "Painting Before and After Words: Margaret Wall-Romana",
  "exhibition_description": "Margaret Wall-Romana’s work engages with the traditions of oil painting. She controls the physics of paint, but also lets go of that control to open up to the paint’s own properties. The irresistible tensions on the surfaces of her large-scale paintings keep viewers looking. Wall-Romana structures her paintings using an elaborate atmospheric perspective balanced with non-illusionistic color. A sharp student of art history, she conflates the still-life delicacies of the Dutch Golden Age with Mannerist attitudes towards scale, Hudson River School atmospherics, and yolky Abstract Expressionist smears. Formally, she pushes the physical properties of paint to their limit, with her use of thin, translucent colors to create delicate surfaces, and chalky impasto for ripe forms and textures.",
