  "exhibition_description": "The Nature of Nature is the third installation in an innovative series connecting art with relevant issues in everyday life. In multiple mini-exhibitions spanning 10 galleries in the Target Wing, MIA curators probe our understanding of nature as depicted in contemporary and historical works of art from all areas of the museumâ€™s permanent collection. By juxtaposing diverse works of art focused on a single theme, these installations invite visitors to explore fundamental ideas about our evolving relationship to nature over time, across cultures, and in our lives today.",
