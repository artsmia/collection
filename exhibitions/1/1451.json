  "exhibition_title": "Standards: Mark Ostapchuk",
  "exhibition_description": "Ostapchuk, an adjunct lecturer at the University of Minnesota, has been making large, abstract oil paintings for many years. He combines a frenetic color palette with controlled compositions, thin glazes with textured and burnished layers of paint. Ostapchuk calls this new suite of paintings \"standards,\" in order to link his project as a painter to his knowledge of music, especially jazz. The paintings repeat tones and add improvisational flourishes.",
