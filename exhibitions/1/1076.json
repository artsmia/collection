  "exhibition_description": "Over its long history, the permanent collection of the MIA has been studded with works of perfection. As the museum prepares for masterpieces chosen from every collecting department of the Louvre, MIA curators from all departments selected their own collection masterpieces. The exhibition is organized around the same themes as the Louvre exhibition and encourages visitors to think about the museum’s collection in different ways. In Pursuit of a Masterpiece and The Louvre and the Masterpiece together focus on the concept of “masterpiece,” and show how certain works of art have influenced generations.",
