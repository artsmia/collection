  "exhibition_description": "Chris Willcox, who teaches painting at Macalester College in St. Paul, first became interested in the history of Antarctica after reading about the Antarctic Treaty of 1961, in which the continent was set aside as a scientific preserve. Working with the documentary photographs from early expeditions, Willcox creates painterly pastiches that capture the beautifully bleak Arctic landscape. She also makes psychological group portraits of these Heroic Age explorers.",
