  "exhibition_description": "In its first ten years, Highpoint has become a vibrant part of the Twin Cities art scene. Less well known is its national and increasingly international stature as a publisher of exquisitely made prints. \"Highpoint Editions -- Decade One\" celebrates their professional collaborations with fine artists of many stripes. The diversity and the quality testify to HP’s Master Printer Cole Rogers and his talented staff’s ability to work with artists to bring their visions into material form. The MIA is delighted to salute Highpoint and to present highlights from its production to a broad public audience.\r\nFeatured artists will include: Carlos Amorales, Santiago Cucullu, Rob Fischer, Adam Helms, Cameron Martin, Julie Mehretu, Clarence Morgan, Lisa Nankivil, Todd Norsten, Chloe Piene, Jessica Rankin, David Rathman, and others.",
