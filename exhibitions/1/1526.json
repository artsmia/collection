  "exhibition_description": "At the heart of Justin Quinn’s concept-driven art practice is an interest in disappearance and illegibility. His fastidious drawings, sculptures, and books are a collaboration with excerpts from classic literature but he has replaced the words with thousands of individual \"Es\", inserted gaps, and bent the lines to make the original text unreadable. He is exacting in how the resulting forms follow the precise word count of the original text, yet, like a concrete poem, turned them into abstract and architectural compositions of the narrative that spread the edge of the page. The silver-point mark making he uses in the large-scale graphite and ink drawings will slowly tarnish, turn to black, and no longer be visible on the hand-made paper. Also on display in “Deeper Wonders Than the Waves” are scattered floor sculptures are bent paper drawings that barely stand up as 3-dimensional forms. Finally, there is Quinn’s self-published book which is bound with hundreds of screen-copied prints of the same page.",
