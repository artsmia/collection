  "exhibition_description": "The scientific method is a process for documenting events, creating knowledge, and testing theories. Peter Happel Christian measures, collects information, and records data, creating sculptures and photographs that are positioned at the intersection of art, science, and history. He observes the technologies that mediate our everyday relationship with art and natural phenomena, including geography, cartography, and topographical surveys. As part of his MAEP exhibition, “Ground Truth,” Happel Christian has invited MIA staff to collaborate with him. He has asked to borrow their office plants, which he will then install in the MAEP galleries and care for during the show. ",
