  "exhibition_description": "Chad Rutter is an artist and bookmaker whose work explores American material and cultural geography through a wide range of media, including photography and sculpture. His fascinating MAEP exhibition will present a running text of Henry David Thoreau’s \"Walden\" on a set of highway message boards. By converting this classic meditation on the beauty of wilderness and creative isolation into tiny 3-line bits of text, Rutter’s installation will conflate the private and slow-paced act of reading with the fast-lane drive through the natural landscape. It will also reflect on the Rutter’s understanding of transcendentalist philosophy, which he links to American values of individualism, car culture and exploration. ",
