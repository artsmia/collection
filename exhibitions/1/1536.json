  "exhibition_description": "As a young art student growing up in Nepal, Binod Shrestha marched in a quest for democracy and later witnessed years of civil war between Maoist rebels and the ruling monarchy. From his new home in America, amid a global war on terror, these previous experiences continue to permeate his work. Taking frequent trips to visit family and friends in Nepal over the years, he has returned with recorded testimonies from others who have seen and suffered the violence firsthand. In Nine Steps dozens of his earthenware pots have been punctured and torn apart. Shresthaâ€™s installations and smaller works, made of elemental materials such as mud, wood, and sand, are metaphors for the collective human bodies who have suffered from intense physical and political pressures.",
