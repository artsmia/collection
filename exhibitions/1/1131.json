  "exhibition_title": "The Experimental Print: Stanley William Hayter and Artists of Atelier 17",
  "exhibition_description": "Hayter’s Atelier 17 was seminal for the adventurous printmaking of the mid-20th century. He encouraged artists to try their hand at printmaking, and the studio became a meeting place for the exchange of artistic ideas. Hayter’s stimulus was particularly widespread, for Atelier 17’s 60-year run in Paris (1927 to 1988) was interrupted by a ten-year exile in New York during the 1940s. Moreover, Atelier 17 became a prototype for the collaborative workshops that have played a central role in printmaking over the past several decades. Dennis Jon has selected this presentation of innovative prints by European and American artists who worked with Hayter. The roll includes familiar names, such as Miró, Masson, Arp, Chagall, Lasansky, Nevelson, Nicholson, De Kooning, and Pollock. Others, such as André Racz and Leo Katz will be new to most of our visitors.",
