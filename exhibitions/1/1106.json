  "exhibition_description": "The MIA continues its renewed commitment to contemporary art with the presentation of “New Old Masters,” an exhibition featuring a selection of prints of the 1960s and 70s by five internationally renowned American printmakers. Each of the featured artists—Jasper Johns, Ellsworth Kelly, Roy Lichtenstein, Frank Stella, and Andy Warhol—has left a unique and indelible mark on the development of contemporary art and printmaking during the second half of the twentieth century. Collectively, their influence is unparalleled. With their artistic legacies assured, we celebrate their achievement.\r\nHighlights of the exhibition include Johns’s exquisite Periscope I (1979); Warhol’s famously grim Electric Chair portfolio (1971); and Lichtenstein’s fascinating Bull Profile series (1972), comprising a step-by-step progression from representation to pure abstraction.\r\nThe works of art in this exhibition have been generously loaned from a Twin Cities private collection.",
