  "exhibition_description": "Adam Caillier and Michael Mott have worked together in the past and this is a continuation of their collaborative practice. Here, they will be making a dramatic shift in scale and orientation from a book project to a large gallery installation. Recently, Caillier and Mott have begun rereading a book of 1980â€™s photographs of the ballet dancer Mikhail Baryshnikov and choreographer John Butler, and they have been drawn to the relationship between architectural space, rehearsal, and the bodies of artists/dancers. As collaborators, they are proposing a one-room exhibition of projected photographs and other two-dimensional media rooted in this material.",
