  "exhibition_description": "This exhibition is an experiment with different ways to display and explain African art. It will be comprised of around fifteen objects, primarily sculptures, taken mainly from the MIA’s collection, that will be shown in various kinds of settings, for example with different sorts of captions, with or without contextual photos, etc. The different settings will explore degrees of accessibility of the objects, amounts of information offered, the use of audio-visual aids, and other “parameters.”\r\nA crucial part of the exhibition will be the reactions – comments, criticism, and suggestions – from the different audiences. The kind of questions to be asked, and the ways in which to respond, will be determined in close association with MIA’s Education and Interactive Media departments.",
