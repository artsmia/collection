  "exhibition_title": "A Vision of Paris: Etchings of Charles Meryon",
  "exhibition_description": "The etchings of Charles Meryon (1821-1879) reveal a vision of Paris before the changes put into effect during the rule of Napoleon III's Second Empire. Meryon's prints capture the essence of the medieval sections of town that were being torn down to accommodate the wide boulevards and new parks and squares of the Emperor's master plan. Yet, Meryon's etchings are not simply exact renditions of vanishing structures, but a personal vision of a city he loved. This vision was darkened by a severe mental illness which eventually took the artist's life just as his etchings were receiving serious attention and favorable reviews. Meryon's legacy of beautifully executed etchings continues to fascinate viewers, and he is considered on of the most gifted printmakers of all time.",
