  "exhibition_description": "About 800 species of cephalopods (a class of marine animals) have been identified, the most common of which are squid and cuttlefish. They can change their colors and patterns instantly, whether for communicating or active camouflage, as their chromatophores (pigment-containing and light-reflecting parts of cells) are expanded or contracted.\r\nDuluth artist Ryuta Nakajima has been studying the color-changing physiology and behavior of cephalopods in Japan. Using waterproof images of artworks from the MIAâ€™s collection, he has photographed cuttlefish responding to and attempting to replicate the colors and patterns of European paintings, Japanese prints, and Islamic decorations. Nakajima has also created plastic molds of small cuttlefish, which he will mass-produce and paint in various patterns that mimic and stylize the cephalopod color-changing properties. Nakajima likens them to collectible Japanese Kubrick dolls.",
