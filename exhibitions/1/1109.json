The department of Decorative Arts, Textiles, and Sculpture conceived Basins, Baskets, and Bowls around a group of significant recent acquisitions in ceramic, fiber, and wood. These include Dark Kiva (1994) by fiber artist Mary Giles, Vessel 80 (2007) by ceramic artist Cheryl Ann Thomas, and Flanged Vessel (c. 1988) by wood artist Addie Draper. Works by modern masters such as Laura Andreson and Beatrice Wood, selected from the MIAâ€™s collection and from private collections, are also showcased.",
