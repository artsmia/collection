  "exhibition_title": "How to make a world: Jaron Childs",
  "exhibition_description": "Childs will present a new series of hyper-realistic & finely details paintings, based on his own photographs that are a rejoinder to contemporary attitudes about beauty in painting. He has done this by carefully choosing images that both test the limits of what is an acceptable level of sentimentality for critical art, and offer visual pleasures that also contain sensations of alienation and loss. With a relatively small number of works, \"How to Make a World\" is meant to engage the various and contradicting claims made on painting regarding beauty, artistic merit, and its relevance as a medium. \r\nThe driving principle of Jonathan Bruce Williams MAEP exhibition will be to display the science and technology of vision. He creates fascinating sculptural installations that re-present digital and analog images and \"utilize photography as a technical and philosophical strategy.\" Most recently, he has been interested in ocular phenomena such as the persistence of vision, linear perspective and the stereoscopic illusion. For example, images will flicker, flash and appear stereoscopically with the aid of new and vintage machinery. Compositional elements, such as the symbolism of Americana and the history of photography, create formal affinities between the beacon of a lighthouse and a movie projector, or a picket fence and a zoetrope.",
