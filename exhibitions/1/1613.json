  "exhibition_description": "Through the eyes of nine talented artists, this exhibition explores notions of personal style and cultural identity in contemporary Africa. Organized to mark the opening of the newly redesigned African galleries, it invites visitors to make connections between past and present perspectives found in the art of the African continent and the diaspora.\r\n“Africa Now: Fashioning Personhood” challenges conventional ideas of African aesthetics and identity and also celebrates the wide circulation of ideas and influences that characterize the work of young African artists and designers. Their innovative contemporary work highlights the international reach of the African continent, featuring the rich exchange of African creativity with global cultures, periods, and styles.",
