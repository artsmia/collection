  "exhibition_description": "Eric William Carroll with be presenting the second installment of his ongoing project \"G.U.T. Feeling.\" G.U.T. or grand unified theory, is a new photographic installation that revels in the absurdity of intuitive actions and the visual organization of science's grandest theories. Formal echoes in dozens of his photographs, collected from his own scientific experiments and found-footage research, bridge the gap between the epic and the mundane without proving a thing. Two gallery-length tables will emphasize the connection between his photographs and the wonderfully obsolete technologies that have been used to visualize scientific observation. A future installment of Carroll's \"G.U.T. Feeling\" will be published by McSweeney's in 2015.",
