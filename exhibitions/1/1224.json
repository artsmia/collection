  "exhibition_description": "Gallery 344 will host a presentation of Books of Hours from the Institute's permanent collection produced in Flanders in the late 15th and early 16th centuries. A Book of Hours is a lay person's prayer book read during private devotions. These books were small enough to be held in the hand, and were easily portable. Many of the pages in these laboriously hand-written books were illuminated - literally \"lighted up\" - with miniature scenes and elaborate initials, painted in bright colors and gilded with gold and precious metals. Preserved in closed volumes for centuries, illuminated manuscripts remain fresh and vivid examples of medieval artistic techniques.",
