  "exhibition_description": "Though we connect with friends and family across the world by our voices, texts, and images, Shana Kaplow’s Near and Far explores the interconnectivity we share through our things. Kaplow focuses on the common chair to bring our attention to the products that fill our home, and asks whether a community can develop around the global reach of a shared commodity. Using ink on paper to conflate chair designs from both ancient China and modern Ikea—which depends on Chinese mass-manufacturing—Kaplow’s techniques of abstraction and photorealism stress the tension of connecting with the unfamiliar.\r\nKaplow also uses video to find connections between cultures, nations, and physical architectures. As part of her 2010 Red Gate International Artists Residency, she traveled to Beijing and recorded Chinese commuters as they passed her in the subway or below her balcony. When covered by projections of Kaplow’s video footage, the gallery walls become windows, and we can see the world as connected by more than our chairs.",
