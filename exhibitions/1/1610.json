  "exhibition_description": "The Minneapolis Institute of Arts is home to over 2,000 drawings, watercolors, and pastels, yet the collection is largely unpublished and not well known. In this large and varied assortment of works is a superb group of drawings, works of exceptional quality that include some of the museum’s key masterpieces. The exhibition features 100 outstanding drawings, ranging from the 15th to the 21st centuries, by European and American artists, including both celebrated masters and others who deserve to be better known. The show presents beautiful drawings from the permanent collection to both local and national audiences and also explores the many roles of drawing from study, to recording moments of inspiration, to problem solving, to medium of choice for finished works of art. All the drawings come from the MIA’s collection. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe exhibition includes 100 drawings executed in a variety of media by a range of artists, including Ludovico Carracci, Baldassare Franceschini, Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo, Antoine Watteau, Jean-Honoré Fragonard, Jean-Baptiste Greuze, Jacques-Louis David, Pierre Paul Prud’hon, Anne-Louis Girodet, Eugène Delacroix, Thomas Gainsborough, George Romney, Edouard Vuillard, Edgar Degas, Eva Gonzales, Henri Matisse, Lovis Corinth, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Käthe Kollwitz, Otto Mueller, Emil Nolde, Egon Schiele, Piet Mondrian, Edward Hopper, John Marin, Grant Wood, Roy Lichtenstein, Jasper Johns, Andy Warhol, and Edward Ruscha.",
