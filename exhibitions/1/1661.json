  "exhibition_description": "\"In the 1980s and 90s I photographed structures that we South Africans had made during the Era of Baasskap, that time, from about 1660 until 1990, in which Whites gradually came to exert dominion over all of South Africa and its peoples. It was the values we had expressed in those structures that I sought and attempted to elicit in photographs and text.\r\n\r\nBeginning in 1999 â€“ four years after the first democratic elections brought Nelson Mandela to power - and continuing into the present, I have engaged in a similar photography of some of the structures that have emerged with our democracy and that I believe are expressive of values in this new, still nascent and yet in many ways old way of being in our society.\r\n\r\nThe photographs exhibited here are from these two separate yet intimately connected bodies of work.\" - David Goldblatt, July 2014\r\n\r\nOne of the preeminent photographers working today, David Goldblatt has received the Hasselblad Award, the Henri Cartier-Bresson Award and the ICP Lifetime Achievement Award. In America, his work has been the subject of solo exhibitions at the Museum of Modern Art (1999), the New Museum (2009), and the Jewish Museum (2010). His work has been exhibited extensively in Europe and South Africa. Some 20 books have been published by and about his work.",
