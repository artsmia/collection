  "exhibition_description": "Jennifer Danos, Natasha Pestich, and Marcus Young will investigate the concept of semblance and repetition in the context of the museum. For them, semblance in art has the potential to question the idea of originality, the institution of the museum, and the act of viewership. The focus of their ambitious collaborative exhibition is to create three versions of semblance—\"false\" publications of posters, announcements, and newspapers to be distributed in the museum (Pestich); the re-imagining of the contemporary prints & drawings gallery (Danos); and pervasive soft singing with MIA staff (Young)—three approaches that play with and disrupt the museum site.",
