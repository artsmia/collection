  "exhibition_description": "The fine and tenacious threads that represent generational and societal memory are the foundation for the work of this Minnesota artist.\r\nMayumi Amada’s exhibition “Kuon: Eternal Flow of Time” focuses on domestic and feminine roles, including and the role woman play in creating continuity and home. Using lacework as a basis for an exploration of Kuon (the Japanese word for the Buddhist concept of time) the elaborate patterns she creates out of single strands represent the circles and patterns of life. Amada’s delicate forms emerge from garbage bags and water bottles often inscribed messages such as “Everybody Dies” in crisp sampler-styles lettering. Her meditations on mortality, ancestry and craft ponder, often humorously, the mundane both in life’s daily chores and in the materials around us. ",
