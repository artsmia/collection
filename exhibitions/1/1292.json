  "exhibition_description": "Photography, moving images, and new media outlets have transformed sporting events into spectacles of mass participation, pop culture, and political drama. Early, innovative photographers and filmmakers were fundamental to this transformation, creating powerful images that put millions of people in the center of the historic, athletic-action. The Sports Show spotlights the artistry and cultural significance of this shift.\r\nEarly 20th-century photographers first captured leisure sports. Jacques-Henri Lartigue’s photographs of his family’s adventures driving racecars and flying planes exemplified these private and personal endeavors. Media imagery, however, quickly moved sports into the public arena. By the 1960s, televised events radically altered the nature of sports, players’ standings, and fans’ participation. Charismatic professional athletes—Joe Namath, Muhammad Ali and others—became international pop icons, and television audiences expanded exponentially. Roger Welch’s The O.J. Simpson Project, reveals Simpson’s early attempts to shape his popular image as a non-athlete, and is seen in the exhibition for the first time in the U.S. since its 1977 premier. \r\nNow, in the 21st century, body-thumping music, roaming cameras, and multi-screen global broadcasts of sporting events create larger-than-life spectacles that attract the critical attention of contemporary artists. Capturing the power of these events, a centerpiece of the exhibition is Paul Pfeiffer’s The Saints, an immersive sound-and-video installation based on the 1966 World Cup final between Germany and Great Britain, which examines nationalism and crowd dynamics in sports. It was shown previously at Hamburger Bahn of in Berlin, Germany, and the Guggenheim Museum, Bilbao, Spain. The installation at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts is its U.S. premier.\r\nThe Sports Show features approximately 175 astonishing works arranged around themes such as Leisure; Circulation; Politics; Icons; Race; and Spectacle. The exhibition includes photographs by Richard A",
