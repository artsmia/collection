  "exhibition_description": "The fine and tenacious threads that represent generational and societal memory are the foundation for the work of this Minnesota artist.\r\nBojagi, a traditional Korean art form, inspires eun-Kyung Suhâ€™s work. Bojagi are cloths wrapped around objects for protection and transport. Although these were made out of small scraps of material, woman would decorate them to create beautifully patch-worked wrappers. Suh uses this technique to protect memories and experiences. Her installations are comprised of multiple pieces, delicate packages containing small bits of intangible information in sheer cloth. Often the packages are silk-screened with images and text, offering clues to the interior. Others, as in Purple on Thursday, hold wishes in gauzy chiffon fortune cookies.",
