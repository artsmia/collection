  "exhibition_description": "This exhibition highlights the creativity and craftsmanship of some of Minnesota's leading contemporary book artists and fine presses. \r\nMinnesota enjoys a national reputation as a locus for the book arts. Indeed, the metropolitan area of Minneapolis and St. Paul is frequently ranked behind only New York as a hotbed of book arts activity. The Minnesota book arts community--made up of artists, illustrators, designers, typographers, writers, printers, binders, papermakers, educators, collectors, and independent presses--is remarkable for its vitality, innovation, achievement, and public and private support. \r\nThe featured selection includes books by such prominent figures as Harriet Bart, Robert Bly, Philip Gallo, Fred Hagstrom, Patricia Hampl, Bill Holm, Frank Kacmarcik, Allan Kornblum, Paulette Myers-Rich, David Rathman, Tom Rose, Gaylord Schanilec, Chip Shilling, Jody Williams, and Emerson G. Wulling.",
