  "exhibition_description": "This major exhibition will feature more than 125 exceptional Old Master paintings, sculpture, Greek and Roman antiquities, and arms and armor from the royal collection of the Habsburg dynasty house in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna, Austria. The Habsburgs were the emperors of the Holy Roman Empire and rose to become the most powerful dynasty on the continent. The Habsburgs called the leading artists of their time, such as Giorgione, Raphael, Titan, and Holbein, to their court to create works that would propagate their glory and splendor. This stunning exhibition will highlight the spectacle of the Hapsburg court, including carriages and court costumes that have never before traveled to the US.",
