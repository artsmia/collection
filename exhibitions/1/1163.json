  "exhibition_description": "On view from the Equinox nearly until the Solstice, this floral free-for-all will include works from every department in the museum. As in any greenhouse, we can expect harmony and discord... abundant brilliant blossoms and a few that faltered. From Redouté to Warhol, Mondriaan [That’s no typo—he used two A’s in his early days] to Mapplethorpe, this will be a mixed bouquet. Tom Rassieur is not known for his green thumb, but he’s going to turn up the heat and hope for the best.",
