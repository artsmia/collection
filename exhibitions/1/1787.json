  "exhibition_description": "This exhibition, which coincided with Art in Bloom, included about sixty photographs drawn from the permanent collection representing various uses of flowers. Classical photographers, such as Ansel Adams and Minor White, focused on flowers in natural settings like gardens and forests. Fashion and documentary photographers like Edward Steichen and James Van Der Zee incorporated flowers into their advertising, wedding, and funeral pictures. And high-art photographers, such as Charles Berg and Adolf de Meyer, included flowers in their exquisite nude and still life photographs. This selection presented work spanning over one hundred years, from Europe, Asia, and the United States, photographed in both black and white and color.",
