  "exhibition_description": "Sacred is the second in a series of innovative installations featuring imaginative combinations of contemporary and historic artworks throughout the museum’s Target Wing. For this installation, MIA curators probe the nature of the sacred within a secular, multi-faith society. By juxtaposing works of art from multiple times and places, “Sacred” invites visitors to explore historic expressions of the divine, the spiritual, the essential, the most-beloved, and to ponder the word’s meaning to their personal lives.",
