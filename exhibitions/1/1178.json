  "exhibition_description": "In 1699, Maria Sibylla Merian (1647-1717) sailed to Suriname to draw and study the insects of the rain forest. She was particularly fascinated by the transformation of caterpillars into butterflies and moths, and her images reveal their successive stages of development from egg, to caterpillar and pupa, and finally to mature adult. The book that resulted from her two year study, Metamorphosis insectorum Surinamensium (Transformation of Suriname insects), included ninety studies of insects, most drawn life-size. Merian was a pioneer in a long line of women botanical artists and the first to depict insects in relation to their host plants. This exhibition will feature nearly twenty of Merianâ€™s images of Suriname selected from the permanent collection. ",
