  "exhibition_description": "Like advertisements today, the enticing images of early poster art often promote more than the featured product. They offer ways to leave your everyday existence behind and enter a world of fun, fantasy and hedonism. This exhibition examines escapism in large-scale advertisements and focuses on three forms of diversion: fast transportation, dazzling entertainment and reckless imbibing. While such activities carry an inherent appeal, an investigation of the historical context surrounding these works will also help to reveal what the public might have been trying to forget.",
