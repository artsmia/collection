  "exhibition_description": "This installation will survey the way water provided powerful inspiration to a variety of gifted 19th-century artists. From the canals of Venice to the busy rivers of the Thames and the Seine, from sailing ships to fishing boats, water proved an irresistible subject in the works of James McNeill Whistler, Francis Seymour Haden, D.Y. Cameron and others. ",
