  "exhibition_description": "The Minneapolis Institute of Arts has actively collected drawings for nearly a century, acquiring works of outstanding quality by many of the worldâ€™s most prominent artists. Expanding on this curatorial imperative, the Department of Prints and Drawings has in recent years redoubled its efforts to collect important contemporary drawings by both established and emerging artists. \r\nThis exhibition presents a selection of sixteen drawings produced during the past decade, including a number of key recent acquisitions. Highlights include a monumental three-panel color pencil drawing by Iranian-American artist Siah Armajani made in response to the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina; innovative figurative works by Mequitta Ahuja, Nicola Hicks, Stacey Davidson, and Cynthia Lin; and masterly drawings by Christopher Cook, Charles Gaines, and May Stevens.\r\nComplementing the selection are several drawings on loan from local private collections, including a dazzling large-format pastel abstraction by Irish-American artist Sean Scully, an intricate silver pencil drawing on black paper by Lee Bonticou, and a delicate figure drawing by Chloe Piene.",
