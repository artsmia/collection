  "exhibition_description": "Two different approaches to understanding and depicting nature melded—with beguiling results—as the long interlacing of British and Indian cultures on the subcontinent came to a head in the 17th and 18th centuries, an uneasy period of spreading colonial rule. This exhibition showcases these unique representations of nature, commissioned from Indian artists by Indian princes and increasingly powerful European colonial patrons—an artistic and scientific confluence that forever reshaped the way we view the natural world.At the heart of the exhibition are 10 “Lady Impey” paintings on loan from Bill Clark. A British colonialist in Calcutta, Lady Mary Impey commissioned Indian painters to illustrate birds from her private menagerie, resulting in more than 200 images that owe as much to European natural science as India’s rich painterly tradition.",
