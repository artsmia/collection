  "exhibition_description": "The Louvre and the Masterpiece will explore how the definition of a “masterpiece,” as well as taste and connoisseurship, have changed over time. The exhibition will feature sixty-two works of art drawn from all eight of the Musée du Louvre’s collection areas, spanning 4,000 years. Paintings, sculpture, decorative arts, and drawings will reflect three major themes: the changing historical and cultural definitions of a masterpiece; authenticity and connoisseurship; and the evolution of taste and scholarship.\r\nThe exhibition explores the changing historical definitions of a masterpiece through selections of objects from the ancient Near East through mid-nineteenth-century Europe and introduces the idea of connoisseurship as a means of identifying works from the past as masterpieces. It also examines masterpieces that were either rediscovered or reattributed based on the changing knowledge and perceptions of Louvre curators during the past two hundred years.\r\nAn in-depth examination of French sculptor Antoine-Louis Barye’s bronze Lion and Serpent further elucidates the exhibition themes, such as the significance of technical mastery and the creative process, and the impact of the artist’s reputation.
