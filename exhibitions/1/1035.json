  "exhibition_description": "\r\nSara Belleau and Nancy Robinson tap myth and folklore archetypes to tell tales both personal and universal. \r\n\r\nBelleau’s photographs capture hand painted backgrounds and constructed sets that conjure elaborate tales. Her \"Holy Land\" series brings ancient stories from the Bible, Torah and Koran to life in a modern Minnesota vernacular. Drawing on stories common throughout to each of these texts, she explores shared traditions and cultures juxtaposed against the complicated political/social present.\r\n\r\nRobinson’s boldly colored self-portraits create a stage in which she stars as a variety of iconic characters that are both humorous and surrealistic. Each character she embodies a distilled memory that transforms her life story into fable.",
