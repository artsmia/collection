  "exhibition_title": "Chasing Matisse: American Moderns Under the Influence",
  "exhibition_description": "In the decade prior to the outbreak of World War I in 1914, dozens of American artists made their way to Paris to see, study and make art, eventually bringing the message of modernism home to the United States. It was Henri Matisse (French, 1869-1954) who had the most significant and lasting influence on these young American painters. This exhibition will examine how Matisse's art influenced American painters to revise their thinking about color and form, challenging the tradition of representational painting in the United States.",
