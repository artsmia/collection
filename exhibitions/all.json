Bresnahan, who apprenticed with the Japanese Nakazato family of potters, well known for his skillfully thrown, uniquely-glazed ceramics and for his commitment to the environment -- used materials indigenous to Minnesota and stoked his kiln with waste wood gathered from the forests surrounding St. John's. The successful firing of the enormous 1,200 cubic feet, three-chamber kiln marked a high point in Bresnahan's artistic career. In addition to the subtle hues of natural ash glazes, the final chamber of the kiln also yielded unglazed ceramics with flash marks of bright reds and oranges, and contrasting soft tans and browns. This exhibition included 50-60 of these objects, and included large-scale storage jars, vases, platters, and teabowls.",

    "exhibition_description": "Organized by The Minneapolis Institute of Arts in honor of the American Institute of Architects’ annual meeting in Minneapolis in May, this exhibition looked at local buildings from the perspective of their drawings and models. Dating from 1880s to the 1900s, these works were arranged typologically, beginning with museum, followed by other buildings in the public realm such as churches, hotels, libraries, and office buildings and concluding with domestic architecture for both town and country. \r\nThe majority of the drawings came from the impressive holdings of the Northwest Architectural Archives, University of Minnesota Libraries, St. Paul; in addition, Avery Library, Columbia University, New York, and the Heinz Architectural Center at The Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh, lent less familiar works which created a more comprehensive architectural representation of the Twin Cities.\r\nArchitect highlighted in the exhibition included Edwin Lundie, well known locally for his residential architecture of the 1920s and 1930s; Harvey Ellis, gifted draughtsman for LeRoy Buffington around 1890 and who later designed furniture for Gustav Stickley; William Channing Whitney, designer of homes for many prominent Minnesotans at the turn of the century, and John Howe, a highly talented draughtsman for Frank Lloyd Wright.",

They took to a logical conclusion many of the ideas about landscape that had preoccupied European artists in the 18th and 19th centuries, while retaining the special character of the country they were exploring: magnificent, dramatic and subtle, by turns. The exhibition will include approximately 80 oil paintings featuring works by Bierstadt, Church, Cole, and Cropsey, among others.",

Jacob Lawrence’s series on Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman of 1938-40 told the story of these African-American heroes in over 60 sequential panels. While Jacob’s paintings told a story and relate to his cultural history, Gwendolyn’s paintings and prints were more personal and represent the people and experiences which have filled her life.",

An introductory section featured sporting arms made during that timeframe which served as stylistic and technological guides for contemporary work. Three Centuries of Tradition presented custom-made sporting arms as consummate examples of the decorative arts, demonstrating the highest artistic achievements in carving, inlay, and engraving of metal and wood. Guest curators for the exhibition include gunsmith Mark Silver, and Wallace Gusler, Master Gunsmith at Colonial Williamsburg. A catalogue accompanied the exhibition.",

Alexa Horochowski scrutinized that behemoth institution known as marriage in a multi-sensory laundry room equipped with bubbles, a working ringer washer, and clothes line installed with embroidered underwear. Lee Anne Swanson combined hi-tech materials and lo-tech ideas in an installation that accessorized a huge, moody painting with a line of waist-high livestock tanks containing splashing glitter-covered mechanical duck decoys. Carolyn Swiszcz revealed her love for accidental gesture and material flexibility in a giant eraser board mandala.",

    "exhibition_title": "John Howe in Minnesota: The Prairie School Legacy of Frank Lloyd Wright",
    "exhibition_description": "John (Jack) Howe was Frank Lloyd Wright’s talented chief draftsman from 1935 until Wright’s death in 1959. One of the first members of Wright’s Taliesin Fellowship, which was begun in 1932, Howe was schooled in the principles of organic architecture. In Wright’s studio, he directed the activities of the drafting room and completed many of Wright’s presentation drawings. Howe moved to Minnesota in the mid-1960s, where he ran his own architectural practice that focused, like Wright’s, on domestic architecture. This exhibition was comprised of 75 to 100 drawings mainly from the collections of the Northwest Architectural Archives, and the University Libraries, University of Minnesota. The exhibition coincides with the Frank Lloyd Wright Conservancy’s Annual Meeting, to be held September 20 – 24, 2000 in Minneapolis.",

And because everyone has personal associations with hair, the gallery design provided opportunities for museum visitors to contribute to a collaborative work.",

    "exhibition_description": "This exhibition featured nightscapes by photographer Chris Faust and painter Mike Lynch, artists who for many years have produced work that reveals the essence of the urban landscape. Diligent explorers of the physical worlds they are both drawn to places that seem to stretch over time – empty dock yards, railroad yards, industrial sites, architectural landmarks, and myriad nighttime haunts. Chris Faust is well known for panoramic black-and-white photographs of landscape, images often filled with contradiction and the enduring tension between humans and nature. A disciplined and masterly technician, Faust achieves lush tonal quality through a process called compensation development, which hear leaned from John Sexton, a student of Ansel Adams. Mike Lynch has been recognized for decades as an artist whose oil paintings, watercolors, and drawings display rare economy and sensitivity. He has devoted himself to night scenes since 1953, when he began painting in earnest. Lynch creates his evocative work through the use of time-honored practices such as nineteenth-century British watercolor techniques.",

Their pictures spanned over one hundred years and represented every major movement in photography. Eadweard Muybridge, working in the late 19th-century, included nude men and women extensive analysis of human motion. Edward Steichen, as a turn-of-the-century pictorialist, idealized the nude, making evocative, soft-focus images. And Edward Weston, working after World War I, created modernist images of women, often emphasizing abstract shapes and forms. During the second half of the 20th-century, photographers such as Bill Brandt and July Coleman, continued to engage the human figure in a wide range of imagery, making it one of the medium’s most enduring subjects.",

Netsuke were an integral part of Japanese dress during the Edo period (1600-1868) and characterized the era's concepts of iki, a chic sense of stylishness and shadatsu, a sensible sort of Bohemianism. This exhibition explored the beginnings of netsuke production, major schools of netsuke carving, contemporary netsuke artists and major iconographic themes.",

This region’s diverse landscape - its wide horizons and high arctic sky - has profoundly influenced her work. Well known for her elegantly evocative paintings of magical plant-filled environments, Kreft had depicted mysterious light-filled spaces containing pods, seeds, and various floating organic forms that seem to reflect psychological states of being. Her recent paintings speak to the luminous beauty of the earth. They present natural phenomena and life pattern in simpler spaces that suggest constellations of various sorts. The atmospheric and reductive quality of these large canvases heightened their contemplative effect and encouraged the viewer to linger in the artist’s ethereal landscape.",

The selection allows the viewer to understand the stylistic development during the 1,000 year period from the 7th-century BC to the 3rd-century AD and the importance of gold and the display of wealth was to these three cultures.",

Each curatorial department was represented. The arrival of more than 60 contemporary works of art from Target’s corporate art collection, nearly 4,000 textiles from the Jack Lenor Larsen archive donated by Cowtan & Tout in 1999, 475 objects from the Norwest Modernism Collection donated by Wells Fargo in 1998, and the ongoing gifts of Asian art from Ruth and Bruce Dayton all contributed to this opportunity to view an encyclopedic collection of world art. This collection embodied remarkable depth and breadth, providing a solid launching point and establishing a high level of quality for the museum’s future.",

    "exhibition_description": "This exhibition features oil paintings, watercolors and woodblock prints by nine artists from a single Japanese family spanning, four generations and over 100 years. The exhibition addresses the evolution of the popular Japanese print from the late 1800s to present; the adaptation of western styles—naturalism and abstraction—into Japanese styles, methods and aesthetics; and, the dynamics of the family tradition in its commercial, stylistic, and interpersonal dimensions. The Yoshida family is fascinating because of the longevity and breadth of the family’s artistic legacy, its high aesthetic standards, and its internationalism. Thus, this exhibition allows for multiple foci, including aesthetics, production, culture, politics, and personalities.",

The culmination of a six-year project photographing the olive orchards and sacred trees of Spoleto, Italy, it revealed JoAnn Verburg’s profound interest in the reciprocity between humans and nature. The exhibition addressed the interrelatedness of life cycles, agriculture, and commerce and the mystery of sacred landscape. The installation reflected a sensitivity to architecture, human scale, and implied and actual time— issues more often addressed by installation art, architecture, or theater than by conventional photography. Verburg saw the olive tree, a life form essential to Italian culture, as a powerful metaphor for exchange. She made a gift of these works in her presentation of living cultural icons that do much to stimulate our own wonder and our own relationships with place and with what is sacred in nature.",

A major component of the exhibition was the project recently approved by Target Corporation for their new public plaza in downtown Minneapolis. Howard Ben Tré is a very important player in the studio glass movement that developed in the 1960s and 1970s in Providence, Rhode Island. He has produced sculptures in cast translucent glass, employing an industrial process and medium known to him from working in various trades as a young man. His pieces exhibited extreme control and symmetry, and resembled ancient archeological finds. The sculptures developed as freestanding works that combine totemic forms with light (transmitted and reflected) and water to create a transcendent experience that invites human interaction. ",

It traced the progression of innovative letterforms from the turn of the 20th century to the 1950s, roughly a sixty-year period in which typography reflected the tremendous upheaval generated by the avant-garde in all the arts. Those advances made in a series of modernist movements, from Arts and Crafts, Art Nouveau, Dadaism, De Stijl, and Russian Constructivism through the Bauhaus, were graphically captured.",

Known for his giant wooden machines “that work in the minds of the viewer,” Chris Larson presented his second film project that uses his sculpture as a theatrical set. As creative director, actor, set designer, and builder, Larsen used poetic themes of Americana and vaudeville to extend his inquiry into metamorphosis, the sacred and profane, or what country western music calls, “Saturday Night/Sunday Morning. In her exhibit, Homo domesticus, Melissa Stang presented two new works. One, a monumental assembled painting that sought to reconcile the expectations she feels as a woman artist; the other, a domestic interior of a mysterious herpetologist filled with kitschy decorative art objects depicting reptiles and amphibians. A table set with three-legged frog patterned plates (all drawn by Stang) reminded us to heed nature’s warnings and pays homage to the humble creatures who have given their lives for “human progress.”",

The selection is purposely devoted to “industrial strength” designs that challenge long-standing concepts of beauty and taste. These designers and manufacturers were attempting to free themselves of applied decoration – function being the driving force. Such advanced ideas as engineering, utility, aerodynamics, styling, streamlining and the exploration of new techniques and materials were shared concerns.",

    "exhibition_description": "\"Frontera Lake Street\" was presented through the museum's artist-run curatorial department, the Minnesota Artists Exhibition Program (MAEP), and by \"Grupo Soap del Corazon (\"spanglish\" for \"soap of the heart\"), a group of artists and cultural activists devoted to the promotion of \"border\" culture in Minnesota. Grupo Soap produces and presents an ongoing series of exhibitions and projects that acknowledge, in particular, the Latinization of Lake Street in Minneapolis, with its mercados, taquerias, tortillerias, Latin record stores, nightclubs, boot shops, and salons. The Frontera Six borrowed from Mexican popular culture, each assumed the persona of an imaginary professional wrestler. In creating their own pop-wrestler characters, each Frontera artist invented a distinct personality and stage name, complete with masks and costumes. These theatrical characters worked to advertise the exhibition as well as to reconcile and celebrate \"high\" and \"low\" art. The artwork featured in the gallery installation included tiny landscapes painted on corn, rice, and other seeds by Salvador Espejo Benitez, depicted scenes of Minnesota on one side, and of Mexico, on the other. Luis Fitch's mixed-media work illustrated the opportunities that have drawn Mexicans to Minnesota as well as the risks that they have taken to cross over. A Central American-style trinket cart by Alexa Horochowski was packed with saleable art miniatures including hand-painted surrogate wrestling figures of the Frontera artists themselves. Douglas Padilla's intense symbolist paintings referenced the North and the South, connecting the Mississippi with the desert. Chilean painter Marcela Rodriguez A. was inspired by her Latino students and the landscape of her homeland. Xavier Tavera's large-scale color photographs revealed Latinos as both visible and invisible.",

Through their collaborative planning and process, the In Situ\" artists established the exhibit's site-specific considerations, including what paintings to execute, object placement, color and lighting, and gallery design. Their installation offered a progression of experiences designed to heighten perceptual awareness for the viewer, illuminating the relationship between abstraction and observation. ",

The installation features several new ceramic sculptures in the Institute’s collection, including a monumental stack pot by Peter Voulkos and a bust by Arneson of Viola Frey (whose work is also represented in the exhibition).",

    "exhibition_description": "The Sacred Symbols exhibition provided a unique opportunity to see the arts created by the people of the ancient Americas in all their beauty, variety and complexity. It featured works from a selection of the notable civilizations found throughout North, Central and South America, objects ranging in time of creation from 2500 BC to the initial period of contact with Europeans in the 16th century. These pieces represented a great variety of artistic styles powerfully expressing the fundamental religious, historical and political aspects of the lives of the people who created them. \r\nAll of the approximately 180 objects in the exhibition were selected from the collections of American museums in the FRAME (French Regional American Museums Exchange) consortium and are masterpieces reflecting the strongest works available throughout the United States. Highlights of the show included elegant ceramics decorated with abstract and representational art designs from the Southwestern region of the present United States, as well as refined stone sculptures, ceramics and personal ornaments from the Southeast. Ancient Mexican cultures were represented by the superbly carved jade statues of figures and animals of the Olmec, the expertly painted ceramic vessels illustrating themes from mythology and history, and elaborately carved stone figures created by artists of the Maya civilization, and the inventive ceramic sculptures from the people of the Colima, Nayarit and Jalisco regions representing different aspects of everyday life. From Central America there were magnificent golden ornaments fashioned in the form of human beings, mythological figures and animals, which were used by chiefs and other people of high status to adorn themselves and mark their status. There were also beautifully modeled and painted ceramics from Ancient Peru, representing individuals, animals and objects from the ceremonial and political culture of the Moche and Nazca people, plus some highly ornamented Incan vessels that showed the interaction of Nat",

    "exhibition_description": "The Jewish alms container known as the tzedekah box occupies a unique place among Jewish ritual objects. Whereas other religious objects are bound by their ritual purpose, the tzedekah box is unaffiliated. The word tzedekah is derived from the root “tzadek”, meaning justice or righteousness. Tzedekah is the Jewish commandment to provide for those that are less fortunate as a means of bringing justice to the world. Tzedekah boxes come in all shapes in sizes thereby offering unlimited opportunities for artists to interpret them. The project will send an invitation to local Jewish and non-Jewish artists, inviting them to create a tzedekah box. Approximately 30 winning designs will be displayed at community sites and culminate with an exhibition at The Minneapolis Institute of Arts. The Tzedekah Box Project will challenge viewers/participants to question their own place in society; their responsibilities to their community; and their ability to be social change agents. It will ask us to reflect on ways in which we could have been changed by philanthropy and ways in which our community may have been transformed by another’s generosity.",

    "exhibition_description": "Artists Laura Stack and Anne Sugnet come to the abundance of the natural world - to its ever-shifting patterns of replication - with great reverence. Both artists have experienced profound events with the physical body and consider making art to be a transcendent action. Through their work they seek to create an antidote to a high speed, high-tech world that operates beyond human pace. Their exhibition \"High Touch\", which features Stack's luminous black and white drawings and Sugnet's intimate mixed-media installations, offers a poetic investigation into the very essence of things. Here we find slow amassed time, things becoming and unbecoming, traces of touch, and tender constellations of forms. In both bodies of work, primordial forms emerge - forms that suggest seeds, cones, spirals, cells dividing, or the cosmos. These shapes are familiar and there is comfort in that re-cognition. Yet they are located in mysterious spaces and for that they do not feel didactic but more like déjà vu - that fleeting sense of knowing, shrouded in mystery. It seems that you've been here before - perhaps in another life, perhaps as a cell or a star.",

The bridge, spanning Interstate 94 at Third Avenue South, forges a new connection between downtown Minneapolis, the Minneapolis Convention Center, and The Minneapolis Institute of Arts. To provide a context for the Marshall Field’s Bridge, the exhibition also examines over a dozen of Frank Lloyd Wright’s bridge projects through photo reproductions, models, and video. Produced over a sixty-year period, Wright’s designs range from simple footbridges in rural settings to multi-level, long-span urban bridges for both vehicles and pedestrians.",

    "exhibition_description": "Hungarian-born Marcel Breuer (1902-1981) developed his tubular steel cantilevered chair, one of his many innovative furniture designs, while at the Bauhaus design school in Germany in the 1920s. After immigrating to the United States in 1937, he practiced architecture with Walter Gropius for a decade before opening his own successful office. His buildings, including the Whitney Museum in New York and Unesco Headquarters in Paris, are as visually arresting as his furniture, and he is regarded as one of the most important modern architect/designers of the twentieth century. “Marcel Breuer in Minnesota” is organized by the Minneapolis Institute of Arts to mark the centenary of Breuer’s birth. This exhibition will feature his Minnesota projects, including the Abbey Church and campus at St. John’s University in Collegeville, and two house projects, as well as his furniture designs from the Institute’s collection.",

J.J. Peet presents a curious array of fake objects designed to carry extreme value or that allude to some secret information or event. He questions the very nature of art through an assortment of found and handmade props -- bags of money; bricks of gold; a count-down-clock; and a mysterious brief case. Don Myhre presents a weird robotic amalgamation in his interactive sculpture, “Raft”. In it he combines a fiberglass jet ski, a downloaded landscape cast in foam, and a tattered taxidermied jackrabbit to create a whacked-out reference to the madness of American comodification.",

The four periods into which ancient Egyptian history is divided – the Old Kingdom, the Middle Kingdom, the New Kingdom, and the Late Period –form the underlying structure of the exhibition.

With the advent of industrial production in the mid-19th century, household goods flooded European and American homes, but they were for the most part unattractive, owing to the little regard manufacturers gave toward their appearance. The 1930s introduced Americans to industrial designers such as Raymond Loewy, Henry Dreyfuss, and Walter Dorwin Teague, who became well known through their streamlined approach to everything from automobiles to thermostats, and through their books on the subject of design. By the 1940s, as consumers began to embrace modern design, manufacturers made a point of marketing goods under the “brand names”of their designers. Russel and Mary Wright and Charles and Ray Eames positioned themselves as practitioners of a new, casual lifestyle for which their modern products were perfectly suited. Today, with the faces and signatures of Philippe Starck and Michael Graves prominently featured on packaging, designers are often better known than their merchandise. Through objects from the Institute’s collection and from private collections, “Household Names”examines the designer’s rise to recognition in modern Ameerica.",

    "exhibition_description": "This exhibition featured more than thirty of the Chinese paintings acquired in recent years through the generosity of Joan Wurtele. The exhibit included small, lyrical landscapes and bird and flower paintings of the Southern Sung dynasty (1127–1279); delicate ink landscapes of the important early Ming (1368–1644); as well as work by Wu school artists, and some fine Buddhist paintings. Also included were representative professional and literati landscape paintings of the late Ming and Ch’ing dynasties (1644–1911), including works by Ku I-te (active 1608–33), Cha Shih-piao (1615–98), Kung Hsien (1619–89), and Lan Ying (1585-1664). Each of these paintings was selected with the museum’s collecting needs in mind. Care was taken to add significant scrolls that helped achieve our goal of building as representative and high quality a collection of Chinese paintings as possible.",

But, have you ever seen a Hollywood Liquefier, a toaster with a built-in conveyer belt, a “Coffee X” cold water extractor, a rotating “Twin-O-Matic” waffle iron, a “Top-O-Stove” potato baker, or our newest acquisition, a muscle-bound meat slicer, the pride of the pantry?\r\n \r\nThe third exhibition in the Institute’s “Case Studies in Design” series is devoted to modernist kitchenware. Ingenuity is often synonymous with modernity and such is the case with nearly forty works selected for this exhibition. Are you aware that one of the foremost designers represented in the exhibition, Harold Van Doren, served as Assistant Director of The Minneapolis Institute of Arts?\r\n \r\nComprised of kitchenware drawn from the Institute’s collection, complemented with additional loans, the works are inventive collaborations between designers, engineers, manufacturers and advertising agents resulting in some of the most remarkable utensils and appliances of the era. The one element missing is the aroma of freshly-brewed coffee, pancakes, maple syrup and crisp bacon. Nevertheless, it is an exhibition for all ages, homemakers or not.",

The artists Eugène Delacroix, Théodore Géricault, Richard Parkes Bonnington, and J.M.W. Turner were active participants in this movement that valued imagination, emotion, exotic cultures, nature, and the literature of Byron, Scott, and Shakespeare. These and other related themes were explored in the works on display. The Romantic era stretched from the French Revolution in 1789 until the middle of the 19th century, with the most intense period of production beginning with the demise of Napoleon in 1815 and progressing until the early 1840s. While many of the artists represented in the exhibition are better known as painters, this exhibition revealed that they were also talented practitioners of lithography and etching. Featured prints included selections from Gericault’s English Set, J.M.W. Turner’s Liber Studiorum, and Bonnington’s views of Paris and Rouen, as well as Delacroix’s Royal Tiger.",

In addition to already recognized master potters — some designated Living National Treasures— remarkable works by emerging artists were also collected. The exhibition reflects the monolithic influence of the tea ceremony on Japanese ceramic production with the majority of the selected works, in form and technique, related to traditional tea wares.",

It is commonly called the “Lansdowne” portrait, the title derived from the name of the person for whom it was painted, the Marquis of Lansdowne. Senator William Bingham commissioned it in 1796 for the marquis, a British support of the American cause during the American Revolution. The artist is Gilbert Stuart, the preeminent portraitist in the United States in the early 19th century. Stuart painted nearly 1,000 portraits in his lifetime including Paul Revere, Abigail Adams, Mohawk Chief Joseph Brandt as well as George Washington and numerous other U.S. presidents. In spring of 2001 the National Portrait Gallery acquired the “Lansdowne” portrait through a generous gift from the Donald W. Reynolds Foundation.",

Following service in the Swiss army, he documented Europe in the aftermath of World War II. The devastation he recorded there was to influence his work for the rest of his life. He joined the Magnum Photographic agency in 1949 and continued to focus on the ‘face of human suffering’. One of his most well known photo-essays on ‘Famine in India’ was published in Life magazine the same year. He also completed assignments in Korea, Okinawa and Japan. He covered the stories of refugees from Mao’s China and the war in Indochina. Werner Bischof died in May 1954 at the age of 38 while on assignment for Magnum and Life in Peru. This exhibition included more than 65 prints covering the Studio Period, Europe After the War and Traveling the World.",

    "exhibition_description": "This refined exhibition of Roman sculpture features over thirty stone portraits dating from the first through third centuries. Selected from the private holdings of New York collector Dr. Michael Miller, the show is comprised of three-dimensional heads, relief fragments, and full figures. Features in the display are royal portraits including those of emperors Diocletian and Caesar Augustus; several private portraits of the aristocracy as well as a group of mythological portraits including Hercules, Cupid, and Zeus. The exhibit provides the viewer a fascinating look at some of the personalities, intriguing iconography, and refined sculpting techniques of classical antiquity that are not available in the museum’s permanent collection of Roman sculpture. This thematic exhibit appeals tremendously to scholars and students of Roman art and anyone interested in classical history and art. A fully illustrated catalogue by Dr. Richard Brilliant accompanies the exhibition.",

    "exhibition_description": "America’s development was at one of its most dramatic moments in the 1850s, a decade celebrated along the Mississippi River as the 50th anniversary of the Louisiana Purchase and the westward expedition of Lewis and Clark. Currents of Change will explore the fine and decorative arts along the river during that period. America was undergoing extraordinary changes: from the steamboat era to the advent of the railroad, from a mostly agrarian economy to the beginnings of the industrial revolution, from a nation of youthful optimism to one which would soon erupt into civil war. Fortunes made from lumber and lead processing in the North and cotton and sugar production in the South gave birth to the great cities along the river that we know today, and financed the demand for sophisticated furnishings and a “refined” life. The Mississippi, which had long been a channel for trade, was becoming an important conduit for ideas about art, culture, and design.\r\nCurrents of Change brings together approximately 175 objects in all media: paintings, prints, and drawings, furniture, silver, ceramics, textiles, and sculpture. The exhibition includes a 16-foot segment from the only extant panorama of the Mississippi River (a 340-foot-long moving landscape), to be shown in a theatrical setting that recalls how viewers of the 1850s would have seen it.\r\nAn illustrated catalogue accompanies the exhibition.",

    "exhibition_description": "Beauford Delaney, an African-American, was an artist who produced works of great diversity and technical complexity who has, unfortunately, remained relatively unknown to the general public. While his pursuit of art began in his native Knoxville, Tennessee, and continued over a five-year period in Boston, the years that followed (1929-1979) were the most innovative and productive of the artist’s life. His career is generally broken into two parts: the New York Years (1929-1953), during which time Delaney produced his colorful and highly-engaging compositions of the City’s urban landscape; and the Paris years (1953-1979) when the artist, known as “the dean of American Negro painters” in Paris, embraced abstract expressionism in a study of color and light. The Institute’s presentation, for the first time, provides a survey of the progression of his work. The exhibition brings forth transitional works that have not previously been considered and illuminate his place within American art history. The exhibition consists of approximately forty paintings and ten works on paper borrowed from institutional and private collections in America and Europe.",

Advances in construction, printing, and mechanization throughout the 20th century have resulted in “graphic” developments for the simple shopping bag and hatbox.  They serves as portable billboards for the store, and once home, can live on as containers for keepsakes—often becoming keepsakes themselves. As department stores and boutiques increasingly consider packaging as an extension of their service and identity, they look to designers for more attractive wrappings. Artists such as Erté, Roy Lichtenstein, Salvador Dali, Andy Warhol, and Frank Stella have accepted commissions to design shopping bags, many of them considered portable art by museums and collectors.  \r\nIn the Twin Cities, such fashion-forward retailers as Young-Quinlan, Field-Schlick, and Dayton’s invested considerable effort and imagination into their packaging. The Institute will feature these and other designs from local shops in the Bell Decorative Arts Court during this year’s Holiday Traditions exhibition, on view in the Period Rooms and at the Purcell-Cutts house November 26, 2004 through January 2, 2005. Costumed docents will offer tours from Thanksgiving through New Year’s Eve.",

    "exhibition_description": "The tiger figures prominently in Asian mythology, where it is identified with yin, the female principle, as well as autumn, wind, and the west. Artists often paired images of tigers with their cosmological cousin, the dragon (identified with yang, the male principle, spring, rain, and the east). Although tigers are not indigenous to Japan, their absence engendered great interest in them and spurred fanciful ideas about their nature and physical form. The earliest Japanese images of tigers date to as early as the 6th century, but the subject became a staple theme of artists from the 13th century onwards. Some artists pictured ferocious beasts in windswept bamboo; others rendered tigers as overgrown housecats.  This exhibition explores the great breadth of tiger painting through the fertile imaginations of twenty-one Japanese artists. \r\nFrom 1959 until 1964, Edson Spencer was Far East regional manager for Honeywell International in Tokyo. While in Japan, both he and his wife, Harriet, became enamored with Japanese art and amassed an important collection of folk painting. This collection was featured in the museum’s 1994 exhibition Øtsu-e: Japanese Folk Paintings. \r\nBorn in the “year of the tiger” Edson Spencer purchased his first tiger painting while living in Japan. Since then, his collection has grown to include 21 hanging scrolls and a magnificent pair of folding screens. Artists include many of Japan’s most famous painters of the last three hundred years, including Tawaraya Sotatsu, Maruyama Okyo, Nagasawa Rosetsu, Kano Tsunenobu, and Kishi Ganku",

    "exhibition_description": "This exhibition consists of 60 subtle landscape photographs dating 1890-1910, drawn entirely from the Institute's permanent collection. Post (1857-1921) was one of the first photographers to make creative images with the camera, associating with Alfred Stieglitz and presenting his pictures in the leading photographic periodical, Camera Work. Post excelled at picturing the snow, water lilies, and apple trees of Maine, rendering them in softly-focused and understated platinum prints. This exhibition rediscovers an underappreciated master, will be accompanied by a catalog, and will travel to other American museums.\r\nExhibition tour:\r\nThe Minneapolis Institute of Arts, September 10, 2005 – January 22, 2006\r\nCedar Rapids Museum of Art, February 17 - May 21, 2006\r\nPortland Museum of Art, June 3 - Aug. 27, 2006\r\nColumbus Museum of Art, September 16, 2006 – January 14, 2007\r\nBrigham Young University Museum of Art, February 3 - June 4, 2007\r\nTacoma Art Museum, June 23 – September 16, 2007",

His subjects range from public events and situations such as Coney Island and Times Square, to county fairs, street theater, and professional boxing. Also included are images of the New York nightclub scene of the 1970s, fashion shows, and other displays of vanity and public preening. The photographs evoke an amusing though gently caustic, tongue-in-cheek satire on how we present ourselves to the world.",

This exhibition celebrated the career and life of this extraordinary artist. The Minneapolis Institute of Arts has over 100 etchings and lithographs by Whistler that formed the core of the exhibition. As an etcher, Whistler took inspiration from Rembrandt and the Dutch masters that he discovered in the print collection of his brother in law, Francis Seymour Haden. Works by these artists were on view, allowing the visitor to see the path of Whistler's development as a printmaker. Whistler was a charismatic and challenging personality whose art and ideas influenced numerous other artists. This exhibition also included works by those who were members of Whistler's circle of admirers and followers, allowing the visitor to see the wide path Whistler cut across the art world. His influence was not only seen in the prints and paintings of the day, but also in the interiors and decorative arts his gathered around him. The exhibition was augmented by a selection of decorative arts, Japanese prints, and other objects that would have graced a Whisterian interior. The exhibition cut across numerous curatorial departments to create a stunning picture of the world of James Abbott McNeill Whistler.",

    "exhibition_description": "Americans Edwin and Mary Scheier (b. 1910 and b. 1908) took a circuitous route to the world of pottery, by way of art school, odd jobs, puppeteering, and positions with the Works Progress Administration during the 1930s. By 1940 their lively pots of Virginia clay won awards at the prestigious Ceramic National at Syracuse, New York. As a result, Ed was offered a teaching position at the University of New Hampshire, where he and Mary produced hundreds of beautifully potted wares often decorated with Ed’s expressive human figures or abstract sgraffito decoration. In the late 1960s, the Scheiers’ move to Mexico resulted in exciting work in new media including weaving design and wooden sculpture. After the Scheiers settled in Arizona in 1978, Ed returned with renewed vigor to clay and has over the past several years created original computer art. This exhibition, celebrated the wealth of work by the Scheiers in local public and private collections, included approximately forty-five ceramic pieces, as well as other objects in a variety of media from their 60-plus years as a creative team.",

The work of Sèvres, Jean Puiforcat, René Lalique, Boch Fréres, Robert Mallet-Stevens, La Maison Desny and Edgar Brandt were among twenty-five select pieces — haute and nouvelle — documenting Art Deco's diverse phases, from the classical-elegant, to the exotic-expressive, and ultimately, to the austere-moderne.",

Inspired by historical documents, especially the 19th century use of morphine to “calm the nerves” of depressed young women, Schmid’s lithographs presented allegorical images of “things that cause teen-aged girls to be bad”.",

Whether a view of skyscrapers in New York, London’s famous sites, the construction of the Panama Canal, or a far off view of a cathedral in the French countryside, you know that “Pennell was there”—and perhaps recall when you were.\r\nA complex, opinionated intellectual and a leader in the Golden Age of American illustration, Pennell wrote many books on art, artists and his travels. His work was his supreme interest and amusement in life, and these examples of his graphic art showed us the legacy of an important artist.",

    "exhibition_description": "\"I just want to say one word to you. Just one word....Plastics.... There's a great future in plastics.\" This brief pronouncement appearing in the 1968 film, \"The Graduate,\" convulsed audiences then, but since has taken on an entirely new meaning. In the span of some 35 years, the entire spectrum of plastics — that \"miracle material\" — has risen from ridicule to respect (occasionally reverence) and, yet again, a scourge-like contempt when it comes to matters of biodegradable disposal.\r\nIn a two-part examination and celebration of innovative plastic design, a first installment will appear in Wells Fargo Gallery of The Minneapolis Institute of Arts followed by a second, overlapping presentation at Wells Fargo Center in downtown Minneapolis. It is the first such arrangement utilizing the city-center facility to expand on a given theme originating at the Institute.\r\nToday, nothing underscores the technological revolution more than plastics. Not since the early 20-century popularity of Bakelite (which will be featured in a simultaneous Institute installation as part of the on-going \"Case Studies\" Series) has plastic been so admired. Tutti-frutti colors, sensuous, tactile surfaces, transparent forms, groovy fusions of art and chemistry, and phenomenal tensile strength are but a few of the qualities fulfilling design needs beyond mere function. In the 21st century, functionality has become multi-dimensional and plastics appear to promise ever-expanding purpose and pleasure.",

    "exhibition_description": "While plastic is considered a \"now\" medium, the modern plastics industry stretches back to the 1920s and the mass production of Bakelite. Its potential was first developed in 1907 by Dr. Leo Hendrik Baekeland (1863-1944), now regarded as the \"Father of Plastics.\" As a simultaneous complement to the Institute's \"Just One Word: PLASTICS\" exhibition, \"Bakelite: Art Through Chemistry\" will be on view concurrently, from March 6 to February 27, 2005. The latter is a continuation of the museum's \"Case Studies in Design\" series. \r\nSignificantly, Bakelite has earned the distinction of being the world's very first totally synthetic, thermosetting plastic. It quickly found its way into homes and offices in a wide assortment of objects, many represented in this exhibition, ranging from kitchenware, household and office wares, to electronics, cameras, tools and jewelry. \"Its versatility extended from cradle to grave\" boasted advertisements in 1939.\r\nMolten Bakelite flowed evenly and gave rise to the smooth, \"streamline\" style so pervasive in the l930s. At that time the ideological thrust of Modernism stressed the importance of new materials such as Bakelite and, in turn, plastics became firmly associated with the ideals and spread of modern design.",

This style of the era is exemplified by the use of brilliant colors, innovative designs, and technical refinement that have never been surpassed. The exhibit features exceptional monochromatic porcelains of gem-like purity, stunning blue-and-white vessels full of imperial dragon imagery, and a dazzling overview of brightly decorated, polychrome wares. \r\nA fully illustrated catalogue by Julian Thompson accompanies the exhibition.",

Guatemalan women are particularly noted for their elaborate, handwoven brocade fabrics. In addition to their traditional ceremonial clothing, however, native women frequently celebrate the beauty of cloth every day by wearing brightly patterned woven or embroidered blouses called huipils. Drawing on recent acquisitions to the museum's extensive holding of Guatemalan textiles, this small exhibition celebrated the creative diversity of eight different villages and their distinctive response to the inherent potential of beauty in everyday life.",

    "exhibition_description": "This exhibition brings together for the first time four versions of the Master of the Embroidered Foliage’s hallmark image from public collections in the United States, Belgium, and France. The fifteenth-century Netherlandish painter—so named for the delicately patterned and crisply executed blades of grass and plants that resemble embroidery in his paintings—is best known for his panel paintings of the Virgin and Child with a book. Virtually identical in composition, these works feature Mary in voluminous robes sitting on a throne while the Christ child in her arms leafs precociously through the pages of an illuminated manuscript. The Master’s panels differ in their settings and other decorative details, however. Some feature landscape backgrounds while others show city streets. Angels, peacocks, or contemporary burghers embellish the pictures alternatively. Rich in palette and pattern, the panels are finely painted with an eye for detail characteristic of Northern Renaissance painters of this era, which include Rogier van der Weyden (c. 1399-1464), upon whose works the Master’s are based. An illustrated catalogue will be published on the occasion of the exhibition.",

Drawn from a collection of post-war posters acquired by Norwest Corporation in 1991, they exemplify the celebrated Swiss International Style initiated decades earlier. Thelonious Monk, McCoy Tyner, Alvin Jones, Arthur Blythe, the Roscoe Mitchell Quartet and Sam Rivers Quartet are but a few of the influential jazz musicians represented. \r\nNiklaus Troxler (b. 1947) is best known for his striking posters for the Jazz festival at Willisau, Switzerland. He studied at the Kunstgewerbeschule, Lucerne (1968-71) and worked briefly as art director at Hollenstein Creation in Paris before founding his own studio in Willisau in 1973. Troxler has been the recipient of numerous design awards, but his work to date is little known in America.\r\nIn their small hometown of Willisau, Troxler and his brother founded a jazz festival in 1975 which soon became world famous. Ever since, Troxler has remained the most prolific and talented of jazz posters artists. While there have been many jazz festivals over the years, none have produced a series of graphics that compare with Troxler’s memorable design. He continues to work in a select field he’s made his own.\r\nPictorial simplicity, bold color fields, rational order, compressed spatial compositions and innovative letterforms are among the qualities that distinguish this group of jazz posters. Clarity and immediacy are the two key ingredients conveyed in multilingual formats meant to transcend language and cultural barriers.\r\nThe Swiss poster movement had a decisive impact on postwar American graphic design, spreading a new “internationalism” in the print world. This cohesive set of posters represents a convergence of two distinct sensibilities: American improvisational jazz and the cerebral order of Swiss graphic design.",

In addition, they sometimes yield personal information about photographers, humanizing them or showcasing their opinions. This exhibition includes about 100 objects of photographic ephemera from the files and collection of the Department of Photographs at The Minneapolis Institute of Arts. The material includes objects relating to Ansel Adams, Diane Arbus, Richard Avedon, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Edward S. Curtis, and many other major photographers.",

    "exhibition_description": "This exhibition consists of large-scale paintings on unstretched canvas and works on paper by the American feminist/activist artist May Stevens (born Boston, 1924). In a series of thematically related works, Stevens explores the concept of an enduring universal consciousness that she believes underlies all human experience. She reveals her own spiritual connection to the world through the depiction of luminous bodies of water – aquatic landscapes – which often feature abstracted sequences of words extracted from texts ranging from Virginia Wolff to Irish poetry of the 5th century BCE. These text fragments serve as memetic cues – reminders of a common human spirituality. For Stevens, these poetic and highly personal works of art evoke a sense of continuance, connection between people, and the transient nature of time, place and life.",

Bands with roots in blues and folk music improvised and jammed freely, allowed their songs to go on at length, and utilized unusual sounds such as feedback. This music was central to the American counter-culture (“hippie”) movement, spawning freeform dance concerts, flashing light shows, and psychedelic posters. Among the leading groups were Big Brother & the Holding Company (featuring Janis Joplin), Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, and Steve Miller Band.\r\nPhotographers easily integrated themselves into the psychedelic music scene. They made portraits of the musicians in the controlled settings of their studios, captured band members on the streets of the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood (where most of them lived), and photographed the frequent and energetic live performances. A handful of talented photographers made iconic images of the bands that were used in magazines, posters, and on album covers. Prominent among them were Herb Greene, Jim Marshall, Bob Seidemann, and Thomas Weir.",

Lindner and Margo Selski features a theatrical display of androgynous ceramic dolls by Lindner and a series of mysterious oil paintings by Selski. Lindner maintains an obsessive relationship with the body and gender and considers many of the puppet-like figures she creates to be surrogates or self-portraits. Selski paintings merge some of the qualities and pictorial traditions of Flemish masterpieces with images of myth and reality. Her ghost-like figures play out layered and mysterious narratives leading the viewer through a maze of awareness, accentuating history, ambiguity and melancholia. ",

    "exhibition_description": "From her earliest mature works to her final paintings – over the course of a career spanning more than seven decades – Georgia O’Keeffe consistently incorporated circular forms into her compositions. Her use of this motif stands in contrast to strategies of abstraction adopted by many of her peers, which tended to be Cubist-based, using straight lines and angles rather than curves and circles. Using the circle and its kin-the ellipse, the oval, and the arcing line-O’Keeffe explored the shifting terrain between abstraction and representation, sometimes calling upon such forms to represent a mood, a reaction to a sensation, or the spiritual essence of a subject, while at other times using them to encourage her viewers to see new relationships between familiar objects. As she developed her unique pictorial vision, O’Keeffe looked to a wide variety of sources, ranging from the theories of Arthur Wesley Dow and Wassily Kandinsky to the work of her American peers, Asian art, and contemporary photography, constantly seeking inspiration and new ideas, but consistently integrating what she learned into a visual language that was, finally, a highly personal and thoroughly innovative contribution to American Modernism.\r\nDespite O’Keeffe’s broad popularity and the numerous exhibitions devoted to her work both during her lifetime and posthumously, Georgia O’Keeffe: Circling Around Abstraction is the first exhibition devoted to this aspect of her work, and promises to make an important addition to scholarship on both O’Keeffe and twentieth-century American art.

    "exhibition_description": "Villa America: American Moderns, 1900-1950, organized by Elizabeth Armstrong, Orange County Museum of Art Deputy Director for Programs and Chief Curator, is drawn from the collection of Curtis Galleries, Inc., founder Myron Kunin, and will present over 85 paintings and sculptures from this collection to the public for the first time. The exhibition begins with a look at key American modernists working in Europe and New York during the first quarter of the 20th century. In these early years, artists such as Stuart Davis, Charles Demuth, Arthur Dove, Marsden Hartley, Gerald Murphy, and Georgia O'Keeffe, to name just a few, were reshaping our view of American art. In the early 1900s many of these artists traveled abroad, where they embraced experimentation to transform traditional subject matter into avant-garde statements of personal expression. After World War I, as New York began to eclipse Europe as the destination for creative people, American artists returned, and many artists from abroad moved to New York. \r\nThis extended period of artistic innovation largely came to an end in the 1930s, after the stock market crash, followed by a more sober, realistic mode, with themes reflecting regional values and a new sense of social responsibility. Artists such as Romare Bearden, Paul Cadmus, Philip Evergood, Philip Guston, Reginald Marsh, and Ben Shahn celebrated an 'American Scene' creating powerful images of everyday American life. In the 1930s and 1940s American Regionalists John Curry and Grant Wood championed a nationalistic art that celebrated agrarian values and the search for American roots. George Ault, Charles Sheeler, and Niles Spencer, among others, returned to a form of classical realism to celebrate the American landscape in their paintings of the period.\r\nIn addition to offering a chronological overview of American modern art, Villa America will also include a selection of major figurative works by such American masters as Milton Avery, Robert Henri, Walt Kuhn, and Andrew Wyeth.

From that earliest period he traveled and photographed widely on assignment for publication. His numerous and diverse books indicate the breadth and geographical extent of his work. The Near and Far East, India, Angor, Nepal, Bénarès, Cambodia, Shaanxi, China, the Soviet Union, North and South Vietnam, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Alaska, the U.S., Mexico, and his native country France. He has been witness to numerous wars and the repressed years of Chairman Mao’s Cultural Revolution in the course of his many and frequent trips to China. He was one of the first western photographers permitted to enter China since the 1949 Cultural Revolution. Highly sensitive to the nuances and subtleties of cultural variations, his photographs provide insightful and memorable vignettes of our rich, complex, and diverse world. He has twice won the coveted Overseas Press Club Award (1967 and again in 1971). This is a retrospective spanning the illustrious career of one of the great French photojournalist of the 20th century. Riboud’s stature in the universe of photo reportage is second to only to that of Henri Cariter-Bresson.",

A concoction of spirits, citrus, spices, sugar, and water, punch was made in hundreds of variations on this basic recipe. From state dinners to tavern gatherings, it was the libation of choice for special occasions-particularly during the holidays. As it grew in popularity, so too did its specialized bowls, ladles, cups, glasses, and mugs made of ceramic, silver, or glass. The Institute will feature punch bowls from the 18th-20th centuries in the Bell Decorative Arts Court during this year’s Holiday Traditions exhibition, on view in the Period Rooms and at the Purcell-Cutts. Costumed docents will offer tours from Thanksgiving through New Year’s. ",

By streamlining production and adapting to the latest fashions, Boston craftsmen produced desirable goods that were less expensive than their English counterparts. Until the mid 18th century, Boston exported more chairs to the American colonies than New York, Philadelphia, or even England. So prevalent were chairs imported from Boston, that other cities advertised their own version of the so-called “Boston chair.” Select chairs dating from the 1700s to the 1950s will survey the impressive heritage of Boston seating furniture.",

The initial installation will range from Alphonse Maria Mucha’s exquisite suite of lithographs, “The Four Flowers,” (1897) to Dadaist exercises in impudent typography. \r\nWorks drawn from the remainder of this collection — 350 objects in various media (metalwork, glassware, ceramics and wood — are installed in two companion galleries. \r\nThe new gallery is devoted to modernist works on paper ranging from architectural renderings, design sketches, wallpapers, photo-montage, collage, graphic design, posters, portfolios to illustrated books. Its purpose is to provide a forum for examining the dramatic convergence of diverse media in the 20th century. It is also intended to complement Papermade Modernism, an examination of paper as sculptural form on view at Wells Fargo Center through September 2006.",

The two galleries devoted to changing craft installations will include innovative and influential early work by now-established American artists such as Robert Stocksdale, Peter Voulkos, and Beatrice Wood, working in various media (ceramics, metalwork, wood and jewelry). This early nurturing of studio craft in the Twin Cities will be illustrated through objects from the Institute’s collection.",

    "exhibition_description": "Despite intense interest in Pre-Raphaelitism, Holman Hunt, the founder of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, has not been the subject of a one-man exhibition since the 1969 retrospective at the Liverpool Art Gallery. The exhibition consists of 64 objects: paintings, drawings, engravings, textiles, photographs as well as some of Hunt’s letters and memorabilia. \r\nThis exhibition looks at the origins of Hunt’s vision, which is rooted in the economic, cultural and spiritual milieu of Victorian England. His concern about contemporary moral and spiritual dilemmas is articulated through works that focus on the theme of spiritual, intellectual, or emotional enlightenment. He is especially interested in moments of insight or revelation, which have the power to change the lives of individuals or the course of the civilized world. The questions that Hunt dealt with in his own times are still relevant today. This is a Hunt for the 21st century, and audiences are able to see how many of our contemporary dilemmas were ones with which Hunt and his contemporaries struggled.\r\nHunt’s secular themes, particularly those featuring women and the relationship between the sexes, reflect his personal experience and have special resonance for modern audiences. His marriage to his deceased wife's sister, who cared for his motherless son, placed him beyond the pale in Britain where such marriages were illegal. He campaigned successfully for a change in the law but never lived to benefit from it.\r\nHunt’s religious subjects captured the High Victorian imagination, and struck an evangelical chord around the world. His vision was disseminated by means of engravings produced after his paintings. The Light of the World, Hunt’s allegorical painting of Jesus, actually circumnavigated the globe on protracted tours. The painting drew immense crowds, gave rise to miraculous claims, aesthetic debate, and inspired the manufacture of large numbers of stained glass windows. If The Light of the World was one of the great icons of art at the turn of the 20th ",

Classically trained in Chinese ink painting, Yang’s earliest influences include the mythology and philosophy of his homeland China; and later, the visions of modern western masters such as Picasso and Marini. Yang’s figurative images express the wholeness of his experience with nature, creating mystical atmospheres and places “where the viewer has never been before.” Very Taoist in their sensibility, Yang’s paintings are occupied with mysterious animals and humans, who defy any singular narrative. Yang suggests that animals see us far better than we see ourselves, and considers their wisdom (and our blindness to it) to be very significa.nt things",

His kinesthetic “drawings” or “paintings” animate the picture plane and allude to myriad inspirations – graffiti, digital technology, contemporary graphic design, and computer animation. Kaniess brings all – over abstraction squarely into the 21st century through images that he draws and paints on used record albums and expanses of billboard vinyl. His double-logic turns graffiti into ”windows” reading of his surfaces, and re-connects our aesthetic consciousness.",

    "exhibition_description": "Creative photographers have great latitude when printing their work from their negatives. They choose paper type and size, they can crop the picture differently, and they can alter the tones and contrast of the image, to name only a few options. Photographers use such techniques to maximize their creative impulse and best convey their message. But, over time, many photographic artists interpret a particular negative in different ways, challenging their viewers to become connoisseurs. Only by seeing prints from the same negative, side by side, can one fully appreciate their differences and, perhaps, choose the most fully realized object. Among the most striking examples are prints of vastly different sizes, silver prints and photogravures of the same image, and vintage versus modern prints. This exhibition, drawn almost entirely from the Institute's permanent collection, will include about 80 photographs, spanning the entire twentieth century. Among those represented are Ansel Adams, Walker Evans, Lee Friedlander, Gertrude Kasebier, Alfred Stieglitz, and Edward Weston.",

His company was among the first to produce cloth to compliment the architects who championed the Modernist Movement. He then moved forward to enhance the refined aesthetic of the last part of the century through the use of natural as well as synthetic fibers and a variety of technical innovations. This gallery is dedicated to the display of materials from the Jack Lenor Larsen Company Archive that was acquired by the museum in 1999. The acquisition was particularly noteworthy because for five decades the company was renowned for its international leadership in the field of contemporary interiors textiles. Selections from the company’s production lines have been the subject of numerous museum exhibitions from Boston’s Museum of Fine Arts to the Louvre’s museum of decorative arts in Paris. With the MIA’s holding of the entire achieve we are able to examine the material in greater depth than has been possible in the past and share with the museum visitor new insights as well as showing pieces that never went into formal production.\r\nDrawing on the company archive of almost 4000 pieces this series of four rotations focuses on the function of the design studio and the roll of four designers whose distinctive talents played a major roll in the company’s aesthetic development. Two of these designers, Mark Pollack and Lori Witzner now head their own companies and the rotations highlighting their contributions to the Larsen Design Studio will also include pieces from their current work.",

    "exhibition_description": "The company developed by Jack Lenor Larsen has long been known for its distinctive interiors textiles that exalt the wonder of natural fibers and highlight their unique textures. However the Larsen design studio has never been limited by stereotypes and in the mid 60’s they created a line of clothing fabric under the JaeL label of dramatic prints on a synthetic knit, the new wonder fabric of that decade. Colors were often bright and demanded attention while patterns ranged from abstract to figural repetitions of exotic birds and animals such as tigers and leopards. The JaeL line received considerable acclaim but production demands in the fashion world differed so greatly from the creation of interiors fabrics, which were the focus of the company, that the line was discontinued after 3 years. Buried within the company’s archives, these textiles have not been seen for decades and it is the first time they have been highlighted in a museum. ",

Of similar importance were sets of bronze bells, which were used during ceremonies to mark the cadence of the elaborate rituals being performed. This exhibition will feature a set of 20 graduated bells - the largest group in a western museum - to explore the technical, artistic and musical characteristics of late Bronze Age bells. Ceramic substitute sets of the same period excavated from lesser burials will also be displayed.",

As of trying to be children one last time, young, adolescent girls swing from trees, take rides in rickety boats and fearlessly test the boundaries of their last Indian Summer. The spectacle of their enthusiasm is designed to seduce he viewer while reflecting back the illusion inherent in the adult recalling of childhood. Idyllic landscapes offer a vision of a Shangri-la that never was or could be.",

As a painter, Munoz speaks to disconnection in epic terms, making a powerful case for the transformation of human consciousness. His paintings are apocalyptic in the most dynamic sense—in Munoz’s world revelation can serve as an alchemical flashpoint. His colossal cataclysmic images provoke the viewer into a rethinking about daily practice. Combining the diverse influences of Giotto, Velasquez and Chaim Soutine, Munoz's paintings mix spirituality with irreverence and hope, exploring the dark side in order to see the light.",

    "exhibition_description": "Alexander Calder is a ubiquitous presence in the story of modern art, and yet he is rarely seen in the context from which he initially emerged as an artist. His artistic parentage consisted of Marcel Duchamp, who provided the name of and concept for the mobile, Mondrian who introduced pure abstraction to him, and Miró who communicated the central thesis of Surrealism. “The Surreal Calder,” consisting of seventy works including thirteen paintings and objects by artists other than Calder, will put Calder back in the midst of Surrealism so that his achievement is more profoundly understood within that context. The exhibition is conceived of as a suite of six distinct galleries. The first gallery will include works by Miró, Max Ernst, Yves Tanguy, René Magritte and will delineate the Surrealist milieu and its chief aspects. In the following galleries themes will explore Calder’s relationship to that milieu during his early years, culminating in 1947 with the theoretical end date of Surrealism. Those works show Calder’s wit, caricature, and linear flights of fancy, his ‘marvelous,’ in the Surrealist sense of that word, personages – fantastic, never before seen, creatures, poetic constructions of unlikely materials, biomorphic forms from an imaginary vision of nature and Calder’s constellations; apparent views of celestial space. The film “Calder’s Circus” runs continuously in a gallery inside the exhibition. Made in 1961, this 19-minute color film shows Alexander Calder at work. A fully illustrated catalogue accompanies the exhibition.",

Invented in the late nineteenth century, it has been used since then by creative photographers interested in the rich, continuous tones of this intaglio process. Alfred Stieglitz illustrated his landmark periodical “Camera Work” with photogravures by Frederick H. Evans, Gertrude Käsebier, and others intent upon proving the artistic value of photography. From 1907 to 1930 Edward Curtis used the process to produce his mammoth and unrivaled record, “The North American Indian.” Paul Strand’s most significant portfolio, sensitively depicting Mexican culture, was printed in photogravure. And contemporary photographers such as Carrie Mae Weems and Bernice Ficek-Swenson also warmly embrace the process. The exhibition featured about 75 photogravures, all from the permanent collection of The Minneapolis Institute of Arts.",

In a world where people, ideals, thoughts, race, beliefs, art, religion and politics are constantly colliding, Larson literally smashes them together to see what unfolds.",

    "exhibition_description": "Jack Lenor Larsen is the most highly acclaimed American textile designer of the 20th century. His company was among the first to produce cloth to compliment the architects who championed the Modernist Movement. He then moved forward to enhance the refined aesthetic of the last part of the century through the use of natural as well as synthetic fibers and a variety of technical innovations. This gallery is dedicated to the display of materials from the Jack Lenor Larsen Company Archive that was acquired by the museum in 1999. The acquisition was particularly noteworthy because for five decades the company was renowned for its international leadership in the field of contemporary interiors textiles. Selections from the company’s production lines have been the subject of numerous museum exhibitions from Boston’s Museum of Fine Arts to the Louvre’s museum of decorative arts in Paris. With the MIA’s holding of the entire achieve we are able to examine the material in greater depth than has been possible in the past and share with the museum visitor new insights as well as showing pieces that never went into formal production.\r\nDrawing on the company archive of almost 4000 pieces this series of four rotations focuses on the function of the design studio and the roll of four designers whose distinctive talents played a major roll in the company’s aesthetic development. Two of these designers, Mark Pollack and Lori Witzner now head their own companies and the rotations highlighting their contributions to the Larsen Design Studio will also include pieces from their current work.\r\nLori Weitzner- February 10 – August 5, 2007 \r\nThe Larsen Design Studio has always been known for its innovation. In the 1990’s they developed a unique relationship with a promising young designer, Lori Weitzner, to create a number of collections for the company. Working closely with the design studio to fully utilize Larsen’s well-known creative technical expertise, Weitzner developed three collections. The exhibition celebrates this creative ",

    "exhibition_title": "Peter Henry Emerson and American Naturalistic Photography",
    "exhibition_description": "Peter Henry Emerson (1856-1936) was a leading nineteenth-century English photographer who spearheaded a style he termed “naturalistic photography.” He argued for photography as a fine art, encouraged his colleagues to use nature as their standard, and introduced the theory of “differential focusing,” whereby the main subject was in focus and everything else fell off into moderate softness.\r\nMany young Americans admired Emerson’s work, forming a movement of naturalistic photography in this country that lasted from the 1890s to about 1930. Like Emerson, they emphasized the beauty of Mother Nature and humankind’s harmony with her. They photographed the land in all its seasons, as well as the devoted individuals who lived on and off it. \r\nThis exhibition was organized by the Minneapolis Institute of Arts and comprises 90 photographs, drawn largely from the permanent collection. Among those represented are Edward Curtis, Rudolf Eickemeyer, Alfred Stieglitz, and Doris Ulmann. The show is accompanied by the first major book on the subject and will travel to museums in University Park, Pennsylvania, and Roanoke, Virginia.",

Less well known are the stunning textiles they created for their own use, from interiors fabrics and apparel to dowry treasures and items defining social and cultural identity.\r\nThis exhibition celebrates the complexity and diversity of Central Asia’s rich aesthetic textile heritage, from the complex silk ikats and elaborate suzani embroidery of urban areas to tent bands and felts created in the nomadic tradition. From Afghanistan to Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan to Turkmenistan work of individual artists have helped to maintain cultural traditions for millennia, whereas the interdependence of highly skilled urban artists of the Central Asian Khanates often reflect influences from the many foreign interactions that were an integral essence of the Silk Road. This installation will not include the art of the rug maker, who justifiably receives considerable exposure, but instead will highlight the art of the dyer and embroider. ",

    "exhibition_description": "This exhibition will feature the work of two artists working from the narratives of their Anishinaabe ancestry and worldviews. Jim Denomie and Andrea Carlson demonstrate two different perspectives on their shared content of irony, story and politics.\r\nThe exhibition will include an expansion of Denomie’s ''Renegade'' series. Denomie plans to revisit these politically charged and humorous landscapes in order to show further developments in the renegade’s ongoing saga. These paintings will be shown alongside an installation of portraiture from his painting-a-day series. By painting a daily portrait from his imagination, Denomie addresses the self-analytical qualities of painting others. These intense images complement Denomie’s Renegades by telling a different type of story that reads more like a personal diary.\r\nCarlson’s ''Windigo'' and ''Aatisokaanag'' series will also be featured. In her ''Windigo'' series, Calson questions calcified views of authenticity and cultural purity through hybridized imagery. She is also interested in how stories are often ascribed to objects and how these objects become surrogates for cultural exchange. In the ''Aatisokaanag'' series, Carlson has painted her interpretations of the sacred stories. Each image in this series serves as a cross-section of a larger cycle of stories.",

    "exhibition_description": "A series of product designs dating from the 1950s through ’80s are presented in this exhibition resulting from the tireless, creative energies of the entrepreneurial Don Harley, a St. Paul native. Over a lifetime career in industrial design, Harley initiated hundreds of designs to shape the products his clients were developing for the companies he represented, including those he owned between 1954 and 1986.  “Creativity is practically synonymous with Harley,” wrote the associate editor of the Counselor, a national industry magazine in 1991.  Harley has preserved an extensive archive from which these conceptions have been selected. The sketches resulting from his companies’ drawing boards range from office products, toys, and advertising, to fire hydrants and snow blowers.  As presentation drawings, they are remarkable for the innovative product designs being promoted, and the skilled draftsmanship utilized in glamorizing the individual pieces, all executed with color pencils — the media of the moment before computers took full rein of the design process.  Through the years, Harley’s clients at home and abroad included Honeywell, Toro, Playskool and Hallmark. ",

    "exhibition_description": "This exhibition highlights the work of Shibata Zeshin (1807–91). Trained as a boy in the art of gold-flecked lacquerware, he gained a reputation as a master lacquer artist by reviving techniques long forgotten, and by advancing the field by integrating many new materials into his designs. He first studied painting to improve the decorations he applied to his lacquerware, but he soon became so adept the paintings themselves won high praise. Trained in the naturalistic manner of the Shijo School, Zeshin rejected the slippily executed and formulaic designs of his colleagues and fought to maintain the quality of traditional Japanese craftsmanship. His crowning achievement was to invent a technique that allowed him to paint with lacquer on paper and silk. This installation is the first to examine Zeshin’s work by looking at his dual role as a cultural preservationist and technical innovator. A fully illustrated exhibition catalogue accompanies \r\nthis exhibition. ",

In her large-scale wall works Visscher uses four-inch ribbons of clear plastic to create focused light projections and shadows. The resulting patterns of light and shadow engulf the wall and cause the plastic to almost disappear.",

The major portion of the exhibition will be devoted to the Malcolm Willey House, built in Minneapolis in 1934. The Willey House was the product of Wright’s radical rethinking of the single family home for the middle class, and served as a prototype for his later Usonian homes. As well, the exhibition will feature the Lindholm Service Station, built in Cloquet, Minnesota in 1958, where Wright combines commercial function and architectural daring. This design closely followed Wright’s 1932 service station for Broadacre City, his visionary--but unbuilt--American town plan. The exhibition will include original drawings from private collections and from the Frank Lloyd Wright Archives, as well as objects from the Willey House and photographs of the house’s recent award-winning restoration.",

Eleventh century buildings have been through centuries of care, neglect damage and restoration. Griep uses her drawings, some over 30 feet long, to try to understand and express the underlying nature of the sites. She searches for an understanding of the correspondences and the differences that go deeper than the surface details and express visually the worldview and tradition of the builders. The act of drawing is meditative; it mimics the role of these buildings as a way of concentrating attention.",

This exhibition will consist of approximately 60 non-utilitarian (no clothing) embroidery made by peoples making the transition between nomadic and agrarian life styles. It will also include a few urban wall panels.The horse-breeding Lakai, agrarian Kungrat and settled peoples of Samarkand and Bukhara who created these embroideries all lived their lives on the exotic silk road that still excites our imagination. Their textiles reflect the diversity and rich aesthetic traditions of Central Asia as well as the identity and cultural values of their creators. This exhibition is drawn from the superb collection of Central Asian embroideries given to The Minneapolis Institute of Arts in 2004 by Jack and Aviva Robinson. A fully illustrated catalogues accompanies the exhibition. ",

In public, the feminine ideal was fully clad and quiet. But the veils themselves were another matter. They told stories.\r\nThrough pattern and color, material and workmanship, a veil spoke of geographic origin, tribal affiliation, economic standing, and marital status. It told the season and social occasion. It could provide talismanic protection. And sometimes, when fashioned for her own use by a woman of a certain skill and temperament, a veil turned community tradition into an expression of personal whimsy. Always a flag of identity, these pieces of cloth revealed as much as they concealed.\r\nRepresenting almost a century of collecting, \"Veiled Communications\" assembles two-dozen superb head coverings from India and Pakistan that broadly reflect the region's diverse textile traditions of dyeing, embroidering, printing, and weaving.",

    "exhibition_description": "Megan Rye’s latest body of work is largely based on photographs her brother took while stationed in Iraq as a United States Marine. Her large format, photo-realist paintings are saturated with theatrical lighting and bright colors to emphasize the ominous nature of the situation. Three artists come together for this exhibition to explore issues of military representation in popular culture; the relationship between patriotism and fear and the way war and conflict is brought into our homes. Justin Newhall presents large-format, color photographs of historical battle re-enactments. Megan Vossler creates delicate graphite renderings from public images of marching troops, soldiers and refugees. Camille Gage alters military photographs, reducing the images to their essential and most powerful elements.",

    "exhibition_description": "Hiddur Mitzvah is a Hebrew phrase that means “adornment of the commandment.” It refers to the admonishment set forth in Jewish law to create the most beautiful ceremonial objects possible in order to enhance religious rituals. Hiddur Mitzvah’s roots were established when Moses sang, “This is my God and I will glorify Him” (Exodus 15:2). Such ornamentation of ritual objects is considered an example of Mitzvot, or good deeds. This exhibition explores the concept of Hiddur Mitzvah by featuring ceremonial objects and textiles from the Minneapolis Institute of Arts and private collections that demonstrate the highest quality in craftsmanship and materials.

While individual objects have been exhibited at the Japan Society in New York and at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the collection as a whole has not been presented publicly before.

    "exhibition_description": "Inspired by the acquisition of the aerodynamic 1936-designed Tatra T87 automobile, the eighteenth consecutive modernist exhibition at Wells Fargo Center is devoted to streamline design. In the 1930s, the essence of time and speed were exemplified in a body of work that embraced industrial design, new synthetic materials, worship of the machine and the cult of the future. The advent of the teardrop form, the sexy, windswept, contour, speed lines and sleek, shiny surfaces are manifested in an array of imaginative concoctions that convey a residue of charm and innocence.\r\nThe exhibition is comprised of works drawn from the Institute’s extensive Modernism collection in which superstar designers such as Norman Bel Geddes, Kem Weber, Henry Dreyfuss, Raymond Loewy — among many unheralded but equally talented designers — are represented. The streamline aesthetic remains one of the most enduring episodes of the 20th-century, characterized by panache and energy. Little wonder there is a widespread resurgence of interest in this fascinating chapter of design.",

    "exhibition_description": "River to Infinity - The Vanishing Points is the summation of a series of reflective mirrored landscape installations that present the viewer with visually constructed cultural dualities. The work points to the convergence of manifest destiny, contemporary American environmental values, and the vanishing of the natural world by recognizing the demise of species, peoples, and, through metaphor, society. At the same time, River to Infinity celebrates the excesses and the opalescent beauty of western culture in a fantasia of recontextualization: the work exists as a place of inspiration and horror. At first, the opulence gratifies and distracts the viewer. As time passes, the viewer is reflected in the mirrored surfaces of the installation, triggering an awareness of personal complicity and entrapment in a web of causation. \r\nRiver to Infinity is an entirely reflective landscape containing a mirrored river. On the banks of the river, reflective floral and fauna of endangered and extinct species coexist with fantastic and ambiguous reflective animals borne of recombinant DNA technology. At both end points of the river, separated by its length, video projections of constantly changing American landscapes play on the walls of the space. As the videos are projected, they are reflected on the mirrored surfaces of the river and its sculptural life forms. ",

It will feature some of the MIA’s most significant examples from the past three decades, by such notable artists as Robert Arneson, Stephen De Staebler, and Viola Frey in clay, and Stoney Lamar and Robyn Horn in wood.",

Supplemented by a modest number of loans from the artist, the retrospective is largely drawn from the Museum of Modern Art’s extensive collection of Friedlander’s work. There are groups of photographs, each narrowly tailored by date, theme, and style. Groups that present distilled versions of Friedlander’s books are identified as such. Completing the exhibition are seven displaying Friedlander’s portfolios and special editions. A fully illustrated catalogue accompanies the exhibition.",

The Passion was the most highly venerated subject during the fifteenth and much of the sixteenth centuries, a phenomenon characterized by high-strung devotions and empathetic emotionalism. Popular Passion tracts encouraged such meditations by elaborating on Gospel events with wholly invented miseries, designed to intensify people’s empathy for Christ’s suffering. As this exhibition shows, printmakers followed suit, adding new forms of torture, inventive coloring, and other wrenching devices to heighten the drama of Christ’s sacrifice.",

This venue will include several Paul de Lamerie pieces from the MIA collection, including the magnificent Wine Cistern (1719-20). A fully illustrated catalogue accompanies the exhibition.",

    "exhibition_description": "This exhibition is part of a comprehensive project that explores the work of one of the most prolific, unorthodox, and controversial modern masters of 20th-century architecture and design. Finnish-born Saarinen (1910-1961) is best known for such modern icons as the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial (Gateway Arch) in St. Louis, Missouri (designed 1948, completed 1964), the Trans World Airlines Terminal at JFK Airport in New York City, and Dulles International Airport in Chantilly, Virginia (both completed 1962). Saarinen’s presence in the Midwest is very strong, with his creation of corporate campuses for General Motors (Technical Center, Warren, Michigan, completed 1956) and IBM (Rochester, Minnesota, completed 1959), as well as churches and campus projects including his collaboration with his famous architect father, Eliel, on Christ Church Lutheran in Minneapolis, Minnesota (1949). By examining the architect’s entire output of more than 50 built and proposed projects, Eero Saarinen: Shaping the Future will be the first opportunity to understand Saarinen’s collective work in the larger context of postwar modern architecture. It will also address his sculptural furniture, including the famous “Womb” chair Eero designed in 1948 for Knoll. The exhibition will be organized into two sections: “Building for Postwar America,” shown at the MIA will focus on building types, illustrating the wide range of Saarinen’s projects in the context of their cultural and political significance; and “The Architect and his Milieu,” shown at the Walker will examine Saarinen and his many collaborators including designers Charles Eames, and Alexander Girard, and local architect Ralph Rapson.

    "exhibition_description": "The Minneapolis Institute of Arts has the Upper Midwest’s most significant permanent collection of fine photographs. Numbering about 10,000 photographs, it covers the entire history of the medium, from the mid-nineteenth century to the present day.\r\nThis exhibition features the fifty most salient and fully-realized photographs in the museum’s holdings. It begins with a 1845 salt print by the English inventor William Henry Fox Talbot and ends with a 2002 color portrait by Alec Soth, from his series “Sleeping by the Mississippi.” In between, the genres of documentary photography, photo-journalism, and street photography are well represented in the show. Included are Dorothea Lange’s “Migrant Mother” and Arthur Rothstein’s “Dust Storm,” both iconic images from the Great Depression. Among the most recognizable pictures are Edward Weston’s “Pepper No. 30” (1930) and Ansel Adams’s “Moonrise, Hernandez” (1941). The names of other photographers represented reads like a who’s who of photography: Berenice Abbott, Diane Arbus, Eugene Atget, Richard Avedon, Walker Evans, Robert Frank, Lee Friedlander, Lewis W. Hine, Man Ray, W. Eugene Smith, Alfred Stieglitz, and Paul Strand.\r\nThis is the first time that the Minneapolis Institute of Arts has presented such a highly-selected grouping of its most important photographs. The exhibition and its accompanying publication commemorate the significant collecting legacy of Carroll T. (Ted) Hartwell, the founding curator of the department, who died in 2007. It reveals Mr. Hartwell’s critical eye for singular historical pieces as well as his belief in the influence and vitality of accomplished living photographers. A fully illustrated catalogue accompanies the exhibition.",

These designs are highlighted by a strong palette, consisting of just three colors; red, white and black. Figural sculpture is often adorned with color as well. The exhibition will consist of objects made by Asmat artists, primarily from the collection of the American Museum of Asmat Art at the University of St. Thomas.

Examples of early Christmas trees and Nativity scenes are highlighted in the Bell Family Decorative Arts Court and the Mary C. and Walter C. Briggs Gallery. To further explore Hanukkah this year, a display of contemporary Hanukkah lamps will be on display near the Providence Room.\r\n\r\nAs well, the MIA’s Prairie-School style Purcell-Cutts House, designed in 1913 by William Gray Purcell and George Grant Elmslie for Purcell and his family, is decorated for the holidays to reflect the upper-middle-class, “progressive” lifestyle of the Purcells around 1915.

    "exhibition_description": "The year 2009 marks the 20th annual Modernism exhibition presented at Wells Fargo Center in downtown Minneapolis. To commemorate the anniversary, Wells Fargo Minnesota has donated a series of twenty Swiss posters — emblematic of the Swiss International Style dating from 1950 -1985 — to the Minneapolis Institute of Arts.\r\nA haven for artists fleeing two world wars, neutral Switzerland formulated a distinct advertising style with special emphasis on the poster format. Swiss artists had been exposed earlier to the move-ments and styles flourishing elsewhere in Europe, yet it was not until the late twenties that the Swiss poster exemplified a universally recognized signature style.\r\nThe active encouragement of poster design by the Swiss government at national and local levels and the institution of an annual competition to promote it were significant, as were such important journals as Graphis (founded in 1944) and Neue Grafik (New Graphic Design) founded in 1958. Replete with articles summarizing the major tenets of the Swiss Style, it was responsible for establishing Switzerland’s reputation as the epicenter of modernist typography. Moreover, the schools of applied arts in Basel and Zurich became internationally important education centers for graphic design.\r\nSwiss designers developed a number of new typefaces in the 1950s, the most popular and celebrated being Helvetica,* a refined version of Akzidenz Grotesk, a 19th-century sans-serif typeface. Helvetica’s widespread use became integral to the clarity and easy legibility of the Swiss graphic style. In fact, sans-serif type was the most emblematic component of the International Typographic Style. In 1954, Adrian Foutiger designed Univers, a mathe-matically constructed and visually programmed font with twenty-one variations.\r\nAmong the younger Swiss designers who emerged in the 1950s through the ’70s as important innovators were: Armin Hofmann (his 1965 book, “Graphic Design Manual,” was a key manifesto of elementary design principles), Tino Steinemann, Car",

It will be comprised of around fifteen objects, primarily sculptures, taken mainly from the MIA’s collection, that will be shown in various kinds of settings, for example with different sorts of captions, with or without contextual photos, etc. The different settings will explore degrees of accessibility of the objects, amounts of information offered, the use of audio-visual aids, and other “parameters.”\r\nA crucial part of the exhibition will be the reactions – comments, criticism, and suggestions – from the different audiences. The kind of questions to be asked, and the ways in which to respond, will be determined in close association with MIA’s Education and Interactive Media departments.",

He worked from the 1910s through the 1960s, producing ethereal landscapes, modernist still lifes, and sweeping panoramas of the city of Prague. Every subsequent Czech photographer acknowledged Sudek’s pioneering work and contributed, in their own way, to the rich photographic legacy of their country. Among them were the modernists Frantisek Drtikol and Jaromir Funke, the surrealist Eva Fuka, and the contemporary figure-photographer Jan Saudek. These and other individuals working in what is now the Czech Republic created one of the strongest contributions to twentieth-century photography in all of Europe. The exhibition will include approximately 75 photographs drawn entirely from the MIA’s holdings and the local collection of Harry Drake.",

Through repetition, non-linear narratives, and patterns, she creates meditative environments that evaluate time. Constructing landscapes she explores the possibility that there could be genetically transferred memories and behaviors that are rediscovered and found through a methodology of free association. \r\nMyhre’s work is made to prompt memory of witnessed events by building an object to commemorate its importance. They are ‘self made’ souvenirs that authenticate an experience and allow embellishment of specific aspects of each occurrence. Carefully chosen materials, objects and processes make a clear representation, but the resulting piece is usually a nostalgic replica rather than a factually correct object. ",

This exhibition, organized on the occasion of the ten-year anniversary of Michael Graves Design for Target stores, will showcase Graves’s celebrated style and will also focus on the roles of context, accessibility, and total design in his work. \r\n An architectural mini-retrospective section will represent a range of the firm’s projects, through models, drawings, and photographs, including the Fargo-Moorhead Cultural Bridge (1977), the Washington Monument Restoration (1998-2000), the Minneapolis Institute of Arts Target Wing (2006), and an extensive integrated resort in Sentosa, Singapore (2006 - present).  A section devoted to product design, which has literally made Graves a household name, will include his iconic whistling bird teakettle for Alessi (1985), jewelry designs for Belvedere (1991), selections from his “top 25” product designs for Target (1999-present), and a soon-to-be-launched line of accessibility products for Drive Medical.

Her installations are macabre scenarios of predator vs. prey, good vs. evil, instinct and survival. Primarily a ceramicist, Jackson is experimenting with materials: glossy ceramic mouths pushing out of suede covered head forms or translucent rubber lit from within to suggest living, pulsing flesh. Her outdoor scenes filled with glowing eyed, hyenas and their victims are like stepping into the middle of the darkest of fairy tales.",

Nine period rooms showcase a range of special occasions, from a feast in Tudor England to a 1770s Hanukkah celebration in Providence, Rhode Island.  Examples of early Christmas trees and Nativity scenes are highlighted in the Bell Family Decorative Arts Court and the Mary C. and Walter C. Briggs Gallery.  To further explore the holidays this year, a selection of seasonal children’s books from the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries will be on view in the Bell Court.  Tours of the period rooms are led by costumed docents and are offered several times per day. For information on holiday tours of the period rooms, please call 612-870-3131.\r\nAs well, the MIA’s Prairie-School style Purcell-Cutts House, designed in 1913 by William Gray Purcell and George Grant Elmslie for Purcell and his family, is decorated for the holidays to reflect the upper-middle-class, “progressive” lifestyle of the Purcells around 1915.  Throughout the holidays, visitors can enjoy lively tours by costumed docents emphasizing the gifts, toys, food and social traditions of each period.  Tours of the Purcell-Cutts House, given on weekends from November 28 through January 3, can be reserved at 612 870-6323 or online.",

    "exhibition_description": "Until Now: Collecting the New (1960-2010) is an in-depth look at international artistic activity from around the globe. The exhibition explores more than seventy-five works, including paintings, sculpture, prints, installation art, photography, and video, by artists; who have altered the direction of art during the past fifty years. While some of these pieces are in the museum’s permanent collection, most are on loan from artists, collectors, and galleries. The roster of artists, which incorporates modern masters as well as those emerging on the scene, includes Siah Armajani, Willie Cole, Mona Hatoum, David Hockney, Ilya Kabakov, Yayoi Kusama, Takashi Murakami, Claes Oldenburg, Nam June Paik, Cindy Sherman, Yinka Shonibare, and Andy Warhol, among many others.\r\nPresenting a fresh vision of contemporary art, the exhibition also builds on the strengths of the museum’s renowned encyclopedic collection. Seeing contemporary art in the context of these diverse cultural forms and historical periods offers visitors new insights and perspectives on art’s ongoing significance and meaning. In conjunction with this special exhibition, a new program titled “Art Remix” features selected works of contemporary art installed throughout the museum in a variety of juxtapositions with the museum’s culturally rich and diverse historical holdings.\r\nUntil Now is organized around general themes that encompass a broad range of global art activity that cut across time, cultures, and other borders. Reflecting significant trends in the recent history of art, these themes include “New Poetics,” “Reviving Realism,” “Poptical,” “Recuperation,” and “Passages.”",

    "exhibition_description": "\r\nMichael Kareken latest body of work tackles the urban landscape, specifically the industrial recycling plants outside his studio window. His paintings are inspired by the never ending piles and constant movement of Rock-Tenn paper recycling plant and the American Iron metal scrap yard he finds metaphoric associations with life and death, growth and decay, order and entropy, structure and chaos. For the MAEP show, Kareken is creating these paintings on a grandiose scale, creating wall size vistas of these plants.\r\n\r\nTetsuya Yamada, on the other hand, works with the industrial landscape of production. Yamada’s work explores the intersection of ideas about the nature of art, craft, machine, and industry. Yamada now delves into the repetition and mundane activities of city life, specifically riding the train during his commutes in his native Tokyo. His installation will explore the way the human mind reacts to passive and repetitive acts, how our mind comes to accept the continuous rhythms of sights and sounds",

The exhibition will feature sixty-two works of art drawn from all eight of the Musée du Louvre’s collection areas, spanning 4,000 years. Paintings, sculpture, decorative arts, and drawings will reflect three major themes: the changing historical and cultural definitions of a masterpiece; authenticity and connoisseurship; and the evolution of taste and scholarship.\r\nThe exhibition explores the changing historical definitions of a masterpiece through selections of objects from the ancient Near East through mid-nineteenth-century Europe and introduces the idea of connoisseurship as a means of identifying works from the past as masterpieces. It also examines masterpieces that were either rediscovered or reattributed based on the changing knowledge and perceptions of Louvre curators during the past two hundred years.\r\nAn in-depth examination of French sculptor Antoine-Louis Barye’s bronze Lion and Serpent further elucidates the exhibition themes, such as the significance of technical mastery and the creative process, and the impact of the artist’s reputation.

Each of the featured artists—Jasper Johns, Ellsworth Kelly, Roy Lichtenstein, Frank Stella, and Andy Warhol—has left a unique and indelible mark on the development of contemporary art and printmaking during the second half of the twentieth century. Collectively, their influence is unparalleled. With their artistic legacies assured, we celebrate their achievement.\r\nHighlights of the exhibition include Johns’s exquisite Periscope I (1979); Warhol’s famously grim Electric Chair portfolio (1971); and Lichtenstein’s fascinating Bull Profile series (1972), comprising a step-by-step progression from representation to pure abstraction.\r\nThe works of art in this exhibition have been generously loaned from a Twin Cities private collection.",

    "exhibition_description": "During the Gilded Age, Americans developed an appetite for paintings by 17th-century Dutch master Rembrandt van Rijn. His paintings are now found in public and private collections from coast to coast. This exhibition will bring together one of the most substantial groups of Rembrandt paintings assembled in America in a generation. While the main focus of the show will be on the artist and his remarkable development as a painter, attention will also be given to his influence on other artists, his status as an icon, and America’s relationship to his art. Taken as a whole, the Rembrandts in America have a distinctive character: the overwhelming majority are in portrait format whether they are portraits or not. The MIA’s own Lucretia, a single-figure half-length, is a prime example.\r\nThe paintings will be a placed in groups that attempt to illuminate specific issues, such as Rembrandt’s experimentation with different ways of handling paint, his interest in actual portraiture and in various types of fantasy portraiture, and the issue of defining the boundaries of his art. While this exhibition cannot be viewed as a full-scale retrospective, it will provide visitors the rare opportunity to observe Rembrandt’s evolution from brash young artist, to confident master, to resolute observer of timeless humanity. Rembrandt collecting has always been a challenging field. The works can be difficult and expensive to obtain, and questions of authenticity are ever present. American collectors—and they are not alone in this—have often bought paintings thinking that they were getting Rembrandts only to find out later that they were the product of other hands. For this reason, a number of works formerly attributed to Rembrandt will be displayed, including one or two for which the pendulum of scholarly opinion has swung back and forth. We hope to use this opportunity to suggest answers to the all too obvious but usually evaded question: If Rembrandt is such a genius, why is it so difficult to tell which paintings are his?\r\nThe exhibit",

Most famous is Lewis Hine’s documentation of child laborers at the beginning of the 20th century and the Farm Security Administration’s survey of the migrant and rural poor during the Great Depression.\r\n \r\nThe exhibition addresses prosperity through three major themes—Currencies; Space; and Rituals and Style. Photographers Jacqueline Hassink (Dutch) and Alec Soth (American) document the private spaces of haute couture. Cindy Sherman (American) impersonates the patrons who support her work and the art world, and Alex Prager (American) stages the Hollywood poses of a generation influenced by cinema style. Artists Eve Sussman (American), Martin Parr (British), and Tina Barney (American) examine social rituals in Los Angeles, Europe, and the Middle East. Abelardo Morell (Cuban) reveals the speculative nature of value and the sheer quantity of goods that circulate within society. Luc Delahaye (French) investigates Davos and the behind-the-scenes financiers and politicians who fund commerce. Sze Tsung Leong (Chinese) and Robert Polidori (Canadian) document the transformation of China and other emerging countries.",

Bojagi are cloths wrapped around objects for protection and transport. Although these were made out of small scraps of material, woman would decorate them to create beautifully patch-worked wrappers. Suh uses this technique to protect memories and experiences. Her installations are comprised of multiple pieces, delicate packages containing small bits of intangible information in sheer cloth. Often the packages are silk-screened with images and text, offering clues to the interior. Others, as in Purple on Thursday, hold wishes in gauzy chiffon fortune cookies.",

Using lacework as a basis for an exploration of Kuon (the Japanese word for the Buddhist concept of time) the elaborate patterns she creates out of single strands represent the circles and patterns of life. Amada’s delicate forms emerge from garbage bags and water bottles often inscribed messages such as “Everybody Dies” in crisp sampler-styles lettering. Her meditations on mortality, ancestry and craft ponder, often humorously, the mundane both in life’s daily chores and in the materials around us. ",

He encouraged artists to try their hand at printmaking, and the studio became a meeting place for the exchange of artistic ideas. Hayter’s stimulus was particularly widespread, for Atelier 17’s 60-year run in Paris (1927 to 1988) was interrupted by a ten-year exile in New York during the 1940s. Moreover, Atelier 17 became a prototype for the collaborative workshops that have played a central role in printmaking over the past several decades. Dennis Jon has selected this presentation of innovative prints by European and American artists who worked with Hayter. The roll includes familiar names, such as Miró, Masson, Arp, Chagall, Lasansky, Nevelson, Nicholson, De Kooning, and Pollock. Others, such as André Racz and Leo Katz will be new to most of our visitors.",

    "exhibition_description": "The word “panorama” was coined in the late eighteenth century by the Irish artist Robert Barker to describe his own elongated paintings.  Shortly after the invention of photography, in 1839, its practitioners also embraced the format, first making multiple-part pictures and, later on, individual images created with a succession of panoramic cameras. Most panoramic photographs fall into two categories; either they mimic normal human vision, or they extend it. Panoramas that mimic our vision are those that present a wider (or taller) view of a scene in a straightforward manner—one that an individual could take in on his or her own, by merely moving one’s head.  Panoramic photographs that extend our vision are those that show us something we cannot actually see on our own.  They extend not so much our vision of the world, but our comprehension of it, by stopping time, showing multiple views of a subject, or other results that only a camera can achieve.\r\nThe exhibition will comprise about thirty-five photographs, books by Josef Sudek and Edward Ruscha, one installation piece by Ken Fandell, and a coffee can reproducing a landscape by Ansel Adams.  Among the photographers represented are Berenice Abbott, Oscar Bailey, Frederick H. Evans, Christopher Faust, Gus Foster, Mark Klett, Stuart D. Klipper, O. G. Rejlander, Art Sinsabaugh, Todd Webb, and Jonathan Wells.  The photographs will range in time from 1848 (a daguerreotype) to within the last few years (digital color prints).  ",

Jennifer Davis, Erika Olson, Terrance Payne, and Joe Sinness create work that focuses on self-image and the desire to create order where nature would have it otherwise. \r\nDavis’s paintings pick up where her subjects trails of thought drop off. The pastel images create a surface veneer of innocence and charm that hints at darker truths beneath the surface. Olson’s drawings and sculptures question the human impulse to clean up and arrange nature and their need to immortalize once-living objects. Payne’s oil pastels use narrative elements and line and color to capture awkward moments in life’s pursuits. Sinness uses colored pencil and sculpture is a personal examination of queer domesticity using fable, history and unconfined possibility as visual metaphor.",

    "exhibition_description": "Death has a lot on his calendar. Of course, there is the work of ministering to and menacing his endless stream of more or less willing clients. But, he also has parties to attend, concerts to perform, and places to go. He is an athlete, adept at riding horses, driving chariots, and maneuvering other contraptions that most of us know little about. His musical skills include stringed instruments, percussion, and brass. It comes as no surprise that he is also a gifted dancer. Death also has a practical side, as demonstrated by his mastery of agricultural implements and time pieces. He is unimpeachably democratic in his associations. In fact, it is difficult to think of anyone he would avoid. Many have claimed the title of “The Great Equalizer,” but ever-busy Death retains the crown.\r\nSo compelling is Death that he has been a subject of fascination to artists since the Middle Ages. This exhibition, a complement to “The Mourners: Tomb Sculptures from the Court of Burgundy” (January 23—April 17, 2011), features the flip-side of the human act of mourning as seen by artists ranging from Renaissance master Hans Holbein to Mexican surrealist Rufino Tomayo. Some artists take delight in the dark humor of the netherworld, some shock us with its fearsome aggression, and others find poignancy in its comfort. Some remind us that Death is an unexpected visitor for whom we must prepare; while, others see Death approaching quickly, attracted by our actions.\r\nDespite his busy calendar, Death beckons you. Great artists urge you to accept his invitation—in your imagination for the present—for eventually Death is sure to find you.",

    "exhibition_title": "Facing the Lens: Portraits of Photographers",
    "exhibition_description": "Photographers, naturally, have a unique relationship with the camera, given it is their tool of choice. They are accustomed to being behind it, shooting with it, and seeing the results of their efforts. Many photographers are also comfortable situating themselves in front of their lenses, making self portraiture either an aspect of their work or its mainstay. On the other hand, some are notoriously camera shy, allowing few photographic images of themselves--Henri Cartier-Bresson being among the most notable.\r\nPortraiture is one of the oldest, enduring, and constant genres of image making, in all media. In the early decades of photography, humans made up the vast majority of subjects placed before the camera, because people believed whole-heartedly in the verisimilitude of the medium. Since photographs were taken “from nature” and did not involve the hand of the artist, they were thought to perfectly depict the physical--and sometimes even spiritual--characteristics of the sitter. Today, we know this to not necessarily be the case, and as photographers continue to confront the camera face on, the lens happily offers up photographic half truths and “lies.”\r\nThis exhibition features about 75 pieces, drawn largely from the MIA’s permanent collection, dating from the 1850s to within the last decade. There are both self-portraits and images by other makers. The eye of the photographer is examined as a metaphor for seeing and the act of photographing and cameras are suggested as an extension of the photographer’s eye. In this vein, images are included of Brassai, Bill Brandt, Man Ray, and Robert Mapplethorpe.\r\nThe idea that a single, solitary photographic image of an individual can fully represent its subject is, of course, spurious. Multiple images, therefore, can fill in the blanks and give a more rounded impression of the sitter, as demonstrated by many acute photographers. Eadweard Muybridge included sequential, full-figure profile images of himself in his mammoth 1880s project on human motion, in which he",

In this exhibition, 22 prints are examined from a feminist perspective, stressing the woman’s subservient role in 15th and 16th century Europe, but also the negative perception of women as immoral temptresses. In some examples, the overt moralistic message is tempered with erotic overtones. \r\nThe works in this exhibition were made by Italian, German, French, Dutch and Flemish artists at a time when printmaking became a common art form. The profusion of religious prints and reproductions by copyists enabled the wide dissemination of images that supplemented the religious education and personal devotion of the viewer, while also upholding strict gender roles.",

    "exhibition_description": "The British visionary poet, painter, illustrator, and engraver William Blake (1757-1827) was one of the leading figures of the Romantic era. Illustrations of The Book of Job, first published in London in 1825, ranks among Blake's best-known and most enduring achievements. This masterwork of the engraver's art comprises 21 line engravings and an engraved title page; each plate is accompanied by text that Blake selected from Job and other books of the Bible.\r\nThe Book of Job, one of the books of the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament), recounts the trials and eventual spiritual awakening of Job, a virtuous and wealthy citizen of Uz. The biblical text was written as a didactic poem framed by a prose prologue and epilogue. Intended as a challenge to the belief that misfortunes are punishment for sin, The Book of Job was for Blake the apotheosis of lyric expression.\r\nTaken as a whole, Blake's engravings are a metaphysical commentary in the form of a symbolic narrative. By Blake's own account, the engravings are not to be read literally, but are rather to be spiritually discerned as conceptions of the artist's personal reading of the Bible. To Blake, Job's spiritual journey paralleled his own creative struggles and spiritual awareness. Completed when the artist was nearly 70 years of age, Illustrations of the Book of Job is the last of Blake's experiments in combining text and image.",

    "exhibition_description": "The glittering society of Versailles was a popular subject in prints in 17th and 18th-century France. For the estimated 1,000 courtiers who kept rooms at the chateau, a dizzying schedule of amusements was offered each season—fêtes, masquerade balls, outdoor theater performances and concerts, fireworks displays—with no expense spared. Arranging these entertainments and parties was important business, overseen by an official bureaucratic department of the king’s household—called the Menus Plaisirs du Roi—which employed a small army of artists, architects, and craftsmen to execute the elaborate undertakings. \r\n\r\nThe prints in this show, drawn from the permanent collection although many never before exhibited in the museum, capture the splendor of the Ancien Régime—or “Old Regime” as post-Revolutionary France termed the former system of aristocratic rule. Many of the printmakers, Charles Nicolas Cochin II, Jean-Michel Moreau, Jean Le Pautre, were commissioned by the kings to commemorate the most important of these celebrations and fêtes, with a desire to propagate, both at home and abroad, the grandeur of their reigns. Ironically, these widely disseminated images of the frivolity and decadence of courtly life may also have fostered mounting tensions against the royal regime, helping to turn the oppressive system on its head at the end of the 18th century.",

    "exhibition_description": "During his lifetime, Sir Francis Seymour Haden (1818-1910) was better known as a surgeon than as an artist. It was considered proper for a 19th century English gentleman to learn how to draw and to collect art, but more as an avocation than as a profession. Haden pursued his medical training in London and Paris and eventually came to specialize in obstetrics. His private practice was successful enough to allow him to acquire a significant collection of old master prints, a well-appointed London home, and a country manor house, and to travel frequently throughout England and the rest of Europe. It was during these holidays that Haden turned to etching and to his favorite subject, the landscape and the eternal beauty of nature. \r\nWhile a medical student at the Sorbonne in Paris, Haden took night classes in anatomical drawing at the École des Beaux-Arts \"to train his powers of observation\" and to improve his surgical skills. In 1844, on a trip though Italy, he etched his first copper plate. Haden returned to the medium in 1857, and, because he was convinced that etching was an art form equal to painting, he founded the Royal society of Painter-Etchers. He also authored several art books including The Etched Work of Rembrandt (1879) and was knighted for his artistic accomplishments by Queen Victoria in 1894.\r\nDespite the vital role he played in the graphic arts, Haden never considered himself a professional artist. He was an amateur in the best sense of the work, and left behind an important legacy of etched works and writings. The 31 Haden prints in this exhibition were selected from more than 250 of his etchings, drypoints, and mezzotints held in the Department of Prints and Drawings at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts.

She was particularly fascinated by the transformation of caterpillars into butterflies and moths, and her images reveal their successive stages of development from egg, to caterpillar and pupa, and finally to mature adult. The book that resulted from her two year study, Metamorphosis insectorum Surinamensium (Transformation of Suriname insects), included ninety studies of insects, most drawn life-size. Merian was a pioneer in a long line of women botanical artists and the first to depict insects in relation to their host plants. This exhibition will feature nearly twenty of Merian’s images of Suriname selected from the permanent collection. ",

    "exhibition_description": "Artist’s books emerged as an art form in the late nineteenth century, and have since become repositories for unbounded artistic imagination. The chance to interpret a favorite text with their own vision is, for many artists, irresistible. The artist’s books exhibited here—spanning more than a century—display a unique commingling of words and picture on the same page, from Pierre Bonnard’s exquisitely daring Parallèlement to Donald Baechler’s quizzical Double Whammy. \r\nThe Minneapolis Institute of Arts is committed to continually strengthening its collection of artist’s books, now numbering more than 600 works housed in the Department of Prints and Drawings. This exhibition presents a selection of recent and important additions to the permanent collection. As these books demonstrate, Greek poetry can provoke an artist’s imagination as readily as a modern-day fairy tale. The artist and author may be friends—like Sonia Delaunay and Jacques Damase—or the artist may take on the dual role of author and illustrator, as Hans Arp and Mark Beard do here.\r\nExciting, experimental, unexpected—the artist’s book format signifies, above all, collaboration between publisher and printer, image and text, high art and craft. The possibilities for expression ensure that all will persist in meeting on the same page for a long time to come.",

    "exhibition_description": "One of the most innovative and influential artists to emerge in the 1960s, veteran Los Angeles painter Ed Ruscha is internationally known for his irreverent and often ironic depictions of Southern California culture, architecture, and urban environment. A first-generation Pop artist who explored meaning in the objects and circumstances of everyday life, Ruscha consistently established a strong conceptual framework for his art. His life-long fascination with words and language—especially the intersection of the visual and verbal—continues to infuse his work to the present day.\r\nRuscha’s Stains portfolio, produced and published by the artist in 1969, features a series of 75 sheets of white paper, each bearing a single stain from one of a spectrum of common organic materials, including such household products as Vasoline petroleum jelly, tincture merthiolate, and Liquid Drano; food items such as egg yolk, red wine (Chateau Latour 1962), and Hershey’s chocolate syrup; bodily fluids including urine and semen; and such oddities as rose petal (American Beauty) and “ant.” The portfolio is housed in a simple black clamshell case, the interior of which has been marked with one additional stain—the blood of the artist.",

They sought to integrate art with life and move beyond what they perceived as the limits of Impressionism. Although the Nabis were trained as painters, they applied their talents to decorative objects and home interiors, theater design and programs, book and magazine illustration, as well as posters and prints. This installation highlighted a selection of their graphic works culled from the permanent collection.",

    "exhibition_description": "The etchings of Charles Meryon (1821-1879) reveal a vision of Paris before the changes put into effect during the rule of Napoleon III's Second Empire. Meryon's prints capture the essence of the medieval sections of town that were being torn down to accommodate the wide boulevards and new parks and squares of the Emperor's master plan. Yet, Meryon's etchings are not simply exact renditions of vanishing structures, but a personal vision of a city he loved. This vision was darkened by a severe mental illness which eventually took the artist's life just as his etchings were receiving serious attention and favorable reviews. Meryon's legacy of beautifully executed etchings continues to fascinate viewers, and he is considered on of the most gifted printmakers of all time.",

The prints of the Danube School are characterized by a profound sensitivity to nature. Landscape and atmospheric elements were used to an unprecedented degree to emphasize subject and mood, while the structure of growing, organic things governed the compositions. It was the Danube School which first introduced into Western Art the idea that pure landscape was a subject worthy of representation. Artists highlighted in the exhibition included Albrecht Dürer, Albrecht Altdorfer, Lucas Cranach, and Augustin Hirchvogel.",

A Book of Hours is a lay person's prayer book read during private devotions. These books were small enough to be held in the hand, and were easily portable. Many of the pages in these laboriously hand-written books were illuminated - literally \"lighted up\" - with miniature scenes and elaborate initials, painted in bright colors and gilded with gold and precious metals. Preserved in closed volumes for centuries, illuminated manuscripts remain fresh and vivid examples of medieval artistic techniques.",

Highlights include a monumental three-panel color pencil drawing by Iranian-American artist Siah Armajani made in response to the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina; innovative figurative works by Mequitta Ahuja, Nicola Hicks, Stacey Davidson, and Cynthia Lin; and masterly drawings by Christopher Cook, Charles Gaines, and May Stevens.\r\nComplementing the selection are several drawings on loan from local private collections, including a dazzling large-format pastel abstraction by Irish-American artist Sean Scully, an intricate silver pencil drawing on black paper by Lee Bonticou, and a delicate figure drawing by Chloe Piene.",

    "exhibition_description": "Margaret Wall-Romana’s work engages with the traditions of oil painting. She controls the physics of paint, but also lets go of that control to open up to the paint’s own properties. The irresistible tensions on the surfaces of her large-scale paintings keep viewers looking. Wall-Romana structures her paintings using an elaborate atmospheric perspective balanced with non-illusionistic color. A sharp student of art history, she conflates the still-life delicacies of the Dutch Golden Age with Mannerist attitudes towards scale, Hudson River School atmospherics, and yolky Abstract Expressionist smears. Formally, she pushes the physical properties of paint to their limit, with her use of thin, translucent colors to create delicate surfaces, and chalky impasto for ripe forms and textures.",

    "exhibition_description": "This exhibition explores the tragic consequences and incalculable human cost of war and violence. For centuries, artists of various nationalities and points of view have addressed this difficult subject in their work, creating distinctive expressions ranging from virulent anti-war sentiments to frank eyewitness accounts to personal reflections on loss and grief. Drawn primarily from the MIA’s extensive collection of graphic art, the 35 works on display include some of the most compelling representations of war and violence ever created. From Francisco Goya’s renowned Disasters of War etchings to Otto Dix’s infamous Der Krieg (War) portfolio to Daniel Heyman’s powerful portraits of tortured Iraqi War prisoners, the selection shines a bright light on the ravages of war and violence as seen through the eyes and minds of artists. \r\nAlso featured are important graphic works by Honoré Daumier, Käthe Kollwitz, Max Pechstein, Max Beckmann, George Bellows, George Grosz, Pablo Picasso, Jacob Lawrence, David Rathman, Ken Campbell, Stephen Dupont, as well as a major sculptural installation by British contemporary artists Dinos and Jake Chapman.\r\nThis exhibition was organized in conjunction with the museum-sponsored program MIA Inside/Out: Battle of Everyouth, a special one-night event presented as part of the Northern Spark Festival, a citywide celebration of experimental contemporary art in public places. This free program begins at sundown on Saturday, June 4, 2011, on the shared campus of the MIA and Minneapolis College of Art and Design. ",

Taking that collection as a departure point, this exhibition brings attention to the museum’s modest but notable holdings of design from the post-World War II era to the present. American and European designers over the last six decades have explored abstraction of form, new technologies, new materials, and adventurous colors in items for household use. This exhibition focuses on these developments through over thirty examples of furniture, industrial design, jewelry, and other consumer objects, including notable recent acquisitions. Works by Americans Charles and Ray Eames, Harry Bertoia, Frank Gehry, and Michael Graves, as well as Europeans Eero Aarnio, Piero Fornasetti, and Jens Quistgaard, are among the designers included. ",

The Waterburys have embraced the evolution of the field and its artists for twenty-five years, collecting pieces that range from exquisitely turned bowls, to objects conceived around irregularities within the material, to works that explore imaginative ways to manipulate the medium.\r\nThe exhibition includes approximately 80 pieces of wood art, representing the changing approaches to the medium during the past twenty-five years, from simple turned vessels to sculpted and constructed works. The Waterbury collection includes works by many prominent artists in the field, both nationally and internationally, including William Hunter, Ron Kent, Michelle Holtzapfel, Robyn Horn, Robert Stocksdale, Michael Mode, Alan Stirt, Hayley Smith, and Todd Hoyer.

    "exhibition_description": "Joseph F. McCrindle (1923–2008) was a tireless and gifted art collector, with a particular fondness for drawings. He began collecting seriously in the 1960s and never stopped, forming one of the greatest private collections of drawings in America in the 20th century. Traveling frequently to London and Italy in search of great drawings, the collection grew to a staggering 2,500 works before his death. It was not only remarkable for its size, but also its breadth and quality, guided by an exceptionally discerning eye.\r\nMr. McCrindle’s passion for drawings was matched by a generous spirit. Upon his death, his collection was divided up among some 30 American institutions, with the MIA acquiring a total of 98 works from his collection. Celebrating this extraordinary gift to the museum, this exhibition features selections from this rich, and very personal collection. And Mr. McCrindle’s generous legacy continues to enrich our institution. Four of the studies from his gift came to the museum in a fragile state, and they were recently conserved with a generous award from the Joseph F. McCrindle Foundation.",

    "exhibition_description": "Photography, moving images, and new media outlets have transformed sporting events into spectacles of mass participation, pop culture, and political drama. Early, innovative photographers and filmmakers were fundamental to this transformation, creating powerful images that put millions of people in the center of the historic, athletic-action. The Sports Show spotlights the artistry and cultural significance of this shift.\r\nEarly 20th-century photographers first captured leisure sports. Jacques-Henri Lartigue’s photographs of his family’s adventures driving racecars and flying planes exemplified these private and personal endeavors. Media imagery, however, quickly moved sports into the public arena. By the 1960s, televised events radically altered the nature of sports, players’ standings, and fans’ participation. Charismatic professional athletes—Joe Namath, Muhammad Ali and others—became international pop icons, and television audiences expanded exponentially. Roger Welch’s The O.J. Simpson Project, reveals Simpson’s early attempts to shape his popular image as a non-athlete, and is seen in the exhibition for the first time in the U.S. since its 1977 premier. \r\nNow, in the 21st century, body-thumping music, roaming cameras, and multi-screen global broadcasts of sporting events create larger-than-life spectacles that attract the critical attention of contemporary artists. Capturing the power of these events, a centerpiece of the exhibition is Paul Pfeiffer’s The Saints, an immersive sound-and-video installation based on the 1966 World Cup final between Germany and Great Britain, which examines nationalism and crowd dynamics in sports. It was shown previously at Hamburger Bahn of in Berlin, Germany, and the Guggenheim Museum, Bilbao, Spain. The installation at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts is its U.S. premier.\r\nThe Sports Show features approximately 175 astonishing works arranged around themes such as Leisure; Circulation; Politics; Icons; Race; and Spectacle. The exhibition includes photographs by Richard A",

Here, they will be making a dramatic shift in scale and orientation from a book project to a large gallery installation. Recently, Caillier and Mott have begun rereading a book of 1980’s photographs of the ballet dancer Mikhail Baryshnikov and choreographer John Butler, and they have been drawn to the relationship between architectural space, rehearsal, and the bodies of artists/dancers. As collaborators, they are proposing a one-room exhibition of projected photographs and other two-dimensional media rooted in this material.",

They offer ways to leave your everyday existence behind and enter a world of fun, fantasy and hedonism. This exhibition examines escapism in large-scale advertisements and focuses on three forms of diversion: fast transportation, dazzling entertainment and reckless imbibing. While such activities carry an inherent appeal, an investigation of the historical context surrounding these works will also help to reveal what the public might have been trying to forget.",

    "exhibition_title": "New Pictures 5: Jason Fulford",
    "exhibition_description": "A few years ago, a friend gave artist Jason Fulford a manila envelope, found at a flea market. The envelope contained over 80 photographs of different mushroom types, each composed and annotated with the care of someone who just had to be a mushroom collector. These anonymous photographs inspired Fulford to create his own collection of photographs, publications, sculptures, and performances, all under the umbrella of his fictional Soon Institute. Similar to the lifecycle of mushrooms, the project goes underground and periodically sprouts up in various artistic forms (including The Mushroom Collector, a book he published in 2010), in unexpected locations, such as New York, California, and Amsterdam. The “Mushroom Collector” is now rumored to be arriving this October at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts as part of “New Pictures 5,” and we are looking forward to seeing what form it will take.\r\nJohn Cage, the avant-garde musician, thinker, and, of course, mushroom collector, noted in his book For the Birds (1981), “It’s useless to pretend to know mushrooms. They escape your erudition. [The more you know them] the less sure you feel about identifying them.” Fulford’s photographs draws inspiration from Cage’s pleasure, wonder, and openness in the pursuit of visual knowledge. The pictures appear to be unremarkable shots of commonplace objects, people, and places. Yet a closer look reveals humorous and subtle oddities: a crane lifting two ladders; a natural branch form casting an artificial multicolor shadow; a happy threesome running toward a cave as though part of a travel advertisement. Instead of a singular, heroic photograph, Fulford’s images reveal themselves through repetition, sequences, relationships between form and shadow, abstraction and reality. \r\nFulford is the co-founder of the publishing house J&L Books in Atlanta / New York, and the author of several titles, such as Sunbird (2000), Crushed (2003), and Raising Frogs for $$$ (2006). This will be his first museum exhibition.",

    "exhibition_description": "The Minneapolis Institute of Arts is home to some 3,000 Japanese woodblock prints. These works, collectively known as ukiyo-e, or “pictures of the floating world,” were produced during Japan’s Edo period (1600-1868). Reflecting the interests and activities of the newly emerging class of moneyed commoners, ukiyo-e prints first featured the reigning beauties of the pleasure quarters and the dashing actors of the Kabuki Theater. Later, artists expanded their repertoires to include landscapes, floral studies, legendary heroes, and even ghoulish themes. Although similar exhibitions have been organized chronologically with prints by individual artists and artistic lineages grouped together, this exhibition is arranged thematically: Women of the Floating World; The Yoshiwara; Actors and the Kabuki Theater; Great Escapes (Travel Prints); Heroes and Warriors; Visual Witticisms (Mitate-e); Classical Inspirations. \r\nEdo Pop: The Graphic Impact of Japanese Prints showcases 188 of the Minneapolis Institute of Arts’ best prints by the genre’s greatest artists including Harunobu, Kiyonaga, Utamaro, Shunsho, Sharaku, Toyokuni, Hokusai, and Hiroshige. Collected and donated by some of the museum’s most generous donors, including Richard P. Gale and Louis W. Hill Jr., the prints comprising this exhibition are renowned for their superb preservation, breathtaking designs and colors, and astonishingly refined printing techniques. \r\nWhile the impact of Japanese woodblock prints on the French Impressionists has been well documented through exhibitions and publications, the enduring influence of this art form, even into the 21st century, has received little attention. This exhibition will demonstrate how these lively, graphic images and their urbane subjects continue to inspire contemporary artists, both in Japan and around the world. Iona Rozeal Brown, an African-American artist, sees parallels in the materialism of Japan’s “floating world” and contemporary hip-hop culture.

    "exhibition_description": "Like a tidal wave hitting the shore, the impact of Japanese art on European artists of the late nineteenth century was startling and profound. Japanese woodblock prints, screens, scrolls, and decorative objects opened new aesthetic possibilities, particularly for artists working in Paris at the turn of the century. Ukiyo-e woodcuts and a wide variety of Japanese artifacts were on display at World Fairs, in commercial galleries, and in Parisian private collections. Virtually every artist working in Paris at the end of the century felt the influence of Japanese art. Western artists incorporated asymmetrical compositions, calligraphic lines, bird’s-eye views, flat areas of color, bold patterns, and outlines into their work. Inspired by the Japanese love of subjects from everyday life and nature, European artists explored similar themes, while Japanese screens, scrolls, and fans led to the appearance of similar formats in Parisian galleries and exhibitions. \r\nBonjour Japon: A Parisian Love Affair with Japanese Art will capitalize on two major strengths within the MIA’s permanent collection—turn-of-the-century French prints and Japanese art. The works in this exhibition will come from the MIA’s permanent collection of prints and drawings and be organized into four thematic groupings mixing a broad scope of artists including Pierre Bonnard, Mary Cassatt, Edgar Degas, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, and Edouard Vuillard. The categories will echo the organization of the adjacent and complementary Edo Pop: The Graphic Impact of Japanese Prints. This synergy will allow visitors to continue their journey through the museum and enable them to easily continue their exploration of the concept of ukiyo-e.",

Makers, curators, collectors, and scholars are discussing the expansion of the contemporary craft field into conceptual areas. Crucial to this discussion is the current role of traditional values, such as function and perfection, as expressed through craft objects. Can these concepts be examined on a sliding scale of emphasis when applied to craft-based media?\r\nCraft and the Hand explores these various perspectives. The exhibition takes as a point of reference the role of the hand in contemporary craft, a fundamental concept that still has relevance in this changing field. Through objects in the MIA’s permanent collection and various loans, Craft and the Hand explores, through thematic groupings, how very different philosophies are carried out by craft-based artists in their work. These range from perfection of form through skill, to using excellent handcraft to achieve a conceptual emphasis, to conscious elimination of the mark of the hand. Featured artists include Bob Stocksdale, Warren MacKenzie, Ken Price, Susan Warner, Frank E. Cummings III, and Amy Sabrina.",

    "exhibition_description": "Prior to 1450, all European books were made by hand. Scribes copied texts letter by letter. To illustrate or decorate the pages, artists used pens and brushes to apply ink or paint, and sometimes further embellished them with burnished gold. In the last half of the 15th century, however, books changed dramatically. By the year 1500, printing presses had taken over much of the work.\r\nJohannes Gutenberg’s invention of movable type—perfected by 1450—immediately revolutionized the replication of texts, but the transformation of illustration and decoration took longer. For decades, many books were hybrids with printed texts and hand-made decoration. Printed images—with or without coloring—slowly began to appear in books. \r\nBefore the printing revolution, the most skilled artists illustrated only books meant for the richest and most powerful patrons. Once printed images could be issued in great numbers, however, great artists began to design illustrations for books catering to the middle class. Albrecht Dürer so fully understood the potential of printed books of pictures that he even assumed the role of publisher, taking control of the entire process, from design, to production, to distribution. His illustrations for The Apocalypse (1498) proved black-and-white images could be so compelling that one would not want to spoil them with coloring.\r\nBy looking at single leaves from books dismembered long ago, one can reconstruct the history of book illustration. Here you can see comparisons of painted and printed works, as well as objects that combine both processes. In many cases, the printed works were made to simulate their painted predecessors, but sometimes influence ran in the opposite direction. Witness the ingenuity printers brought to mass production. Some attempted to print text and image from a single surface or to employ modular elements that could be re-used and re-combined. Others tried to use finely engraved copper printing plates, although woodcuts ultimately proved more practical. While the gem-like quality ",

    "exhibition_description": "Contemporary fiber artists working over the last forty years have mined American folk quilts for techniques and patterns commonly seen in these ubiquitous domestic objects. Drawing inspiration from the quilt’s geometric structure, contrasting, often bold color and fabric combinations, and decorative layers of stitches, the artists featured in this exhibition explore personal expression through references to this traditional textile art. Combining multiple techniques with a conscious, sophisticated approach to composition, many of these works can be seen in the context of the so-called “surface design” movement active since the 1970s. \r\n “Layered Abstraction” features a variety of contemporary fiber art from the MIA’s collection. In addition to works by Sheila Hicks, Jack Lenor Larsen, and Jan Myers, it will showcase a recent MIA acquisition: Mary Lee Bendolph’s striking quilt, Strings, a contemporary example of the Gee’s Bend, Alabama quilting style. Strings well illustrates how the Gee’s Bend quilters have interpreted traditional designs in highly-individualized fashions, producing functional quilts that are now prized as abstract artworks. The exhibition will also feature quilt-inspired garments from the Goldstein Museum of Design and, as part of the MIA’s ReMix initiative, an exploration of layered abstraction in relief sculpture by Minnesota abstract artist Charles Biederman.",

Comprised of day-glo gestural landscapes, paintings made after Ansel Adams photographs, and cinder block table sculptures, “Seven Billion” is a response to the aesthetic projects of modern art and architecture. It’s no accident that Fitz’s work is made from economical materials such as insulation foam and chip board, or that he works so quickly. By doing so he wants to leave his decision making process visible and make a counter-point to the legacy of modern painters and sculptors. This leaves his work wide open for questions about the sacred value given art, the environmental concerns of art making, and the emphasis placed on craft and presentation. Fitz’s work has been part of group exhibitions at Form+Content, the Soap Factory and Weisman Art Museum.",

The title of the exhibition is borrowed from meteorological terms for lines on a map that are drawn in order to connect two or more points that share similar data. For two artists who are working together on a single exhibition, they are terms that allude to what might happen when different work styles merge in the space of a single exhibition. This show will be comprised of new paintings, prints, and sculptures, in various media. And through these works, audiences will be able see how their exhibition showcases their expanded practice and how they use concepts of idle time and desperation in their work. Both Farstad and Frohlic have exhibited extensively in the Twin Cities, including the Soap Factory, Art of This, and They Won’t Find Us Here. ",

    "exhibition_description": "The past century has been a period of unprecedented technological change and global social upheaval, causing a dramatic shift in our collective perception and experience of reality. Once agreed-upon beliefs, or “truths,” have been cast into doubt. As viewers of The Colbert Report know, we are living in an age of “truthiness,” where things we wish to be true are preferred to things we know are true. \r\nIn this exhibition, contemporary artists from around the world use unexpected and diverse means to explore this modern conundrum. Their work can be divided into three general categories (often overlapping).\r\n1—Deception and Play: From Trompe l’Oeil to the Authentic Fake\r\nThese artworks appear to be paintings or sculptures, but play with deception, navigating the borders of illusion and reality, between the authentic and the fake.\r\n2—Reshaping the Real: Film, Memory, and the Virtual\r\nThis art uses film, video, and photography—media once thought to faithfully reproduce reality—to challenge assumptions about the physical and the virtual.\r\n3—The Status of Fact: Unreliable Narrators, Parafiction, and Truthiness\r\nSuch artists create fictional identities, stories, and works that are presented as fact. \r\nThe artworks in More Real? Art in the Age of Truthiness grapple with fascinating questions about the world today: How do we define what is real in a world where a multitude of media can radically reshape the original experience being depicted? What is the role of technology in such artistic expressions? How do we navigate between truthiness and deception in everyday life? When can fiction be truthful? \r\nIn a time when the relationship between fact and fiction has never been murkier, the artists in “More Real?” explore a shifting sense of what is real and what is not, and the consequences of not understanding the difference. \r\nThe exhibition More Real? Art in the Age of Truthiness, along with an accompanying 304-page catalogue and an interpretive website, provides a broad historical and cultural context for the questions that",

Alfred Moir was born and raised in Minneapolis, but spent most of his life in southern California. A specialist in 17th-century art, he was a professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, where he taught for almost 30 years and retired emeritus in 1991. A selection of works from his collection will be featured in this exhibition.",

Concurrently with \"Rembrandt in America,\" the MIA will present an exhibition of the master's etchings. From quick sketches to elaborate baroque masterpieces, Rembrandt produced an astonishingly imaginative and diverse body of work. He studied beggars in the street, loved ones in his home, and unforgettably his own likeness--sometimes growling at us, sometimes costumed as a dandy, sometimes displaying full awareness of his own limitations. He recorded the world around him, from humble animals to majestic trees to dilapidated farmhouses. He reimagined the stories of the Bible, each time endowing the scene with drama or tender human emotion. This exhibition shows the mind of a genius at work.",

His fastidious drawings, sculptures, and books are a collaboration with excerpts from classic literature but he has replaced the words with thousands of individual \"Es\", inserted gaps, and bent the lines to make the original text unreadable. He is exacting in how the resulting forms follow the precise word count of the original text, yet, like a concrete poem, turned them into abstract and architectural compositions of the narrative that spread the edge of the page. The silver-point mark making he uses in the large-scale graphite and ink drawings will slowly tarnish, turn to black, and no longer be visible on the hand-made paper. Also on display in “Deeper Wonders Than the Waves” are scattered floor sculptures are bent paper drawings that barely stand up as 3-dimensional forms. Finally, there is Quinn’s self-published book which is bound with hundreds of screen-copied prints of the same page.",

Blegen has included many familiar names in his collection, especially those artists interested in identity politics, such as Glenn Ligon, Jonathan Horowitz, and Jenny Holzer.

From his new home in America, amid a global war on terror, these previous experiences continue to permeate his work. Taking frequent trips to visit family and friends in Nepal over the years, he has returned with recorded testimonies from others who have seen and suffered the violence firsthand. In Nine Steps dozens of his earthenware pots have been punctured and torn apart. Shrestha’s installations and smaller works, made of elemental materials such as mud, wood, and sand, are metaphors for the collective human bodies who have suffered from intense physical and political pressures.",

    "exhibition_description": "The cupboard of early American domestic and presentation silver assembled by Paul and Elissa Cahn over some thirty years is unified by strong design, fine craftsmanship, and awareness on the part of the collectors for both the course of American history and the history of the craft in the colonies.\r\n“A Handsome Cupboard of Plate” begins in Boston, with a c. 1690 caudle cup marked by the first native-born American silversmith—Jeremiah Dummer (1645-1718)—which has a history of ownership in the Tufts family of Massachusetts—proceeds to New York, with a robust tankard and a distinctive large fluted and gadrooned caster reflecting the Dutch heritage of that region marked by Bartholomew Schaats (1683-1758), and progresses to Philadelphia, where generations of the Quaker Richardson family supplied goods of the “best sort, but plain” to their clientele, including Lydia and Oswald Peel, who acquired an octagonal covered sugar dish and tea caddies ca. 1736.\r\nSilver of the post-Revolutionary War era in the Cahn cupboard documents transitions to a new aesthetic that exploited available technology for rolling sheet metal and a neoclassical ornamental vocabulary. The shop of patriot Paul Revere Jr. notably utilized both new manufacturing techniques and the new ornament. These changes are apparent in the laurel-leaf wreath enclosing the dedicatory inscription on the Danielson Family commemorative tankard (c. 1783), and in the seamed, fluted, and swag-and-tassel engraved Adams-Quincy teapot with stand (c. 1790). In New York and Philadelphia, the shops of Myer Myers and Joseph Lownes (1758-1820) utilized the sleek, smooth, “flatted” (rolled) sheet silver in hooped tankards and canns, respectively.\r\nThe end of the second presidential term of George Washington in 1797 closes out the Cahn cupboard of plate. Myer Myers died in 1795; Joseph Richardson II became second assayer at the U. S. Mint (by Washington’s appointment), and Paul Revere Jr. left the artisan silversmith’s shop to preside over industrial production of bells, cannon, ",

    "exhibition_title": "Picturing Poverty: Artistic Views of the Poor in the Baroque Era",
    "exhibition_description": "During the 17th century, artists in Europe began looking to everyday life for their subjects, with special attention to the poor.\r\nThe plight of the impoverished came to the fore during the Thirty Years War (1618–48), which reduced broad swaths of Europe to subsistence living or starvation. People were also familiar with Gospel teachings that exalted the poor as inheritors of the kingdom of heaven. Jesus himself was born in a humble stable and had simple shepherds as his first visitors. Artist after artist depicted the Holy Family’s flight into Egypt, riding on a donkey and cooking over a campfire. A strong note of compassion informed the work of Stefano della Bella and Rembrandt, whose portrayals of wretched humanity in this exhibition often took on a remarkably personal character.\r\nMany artists were able to find a sort of ragged dignity in the lower levels of society. They showed the poor in attitudes of industrious acceptance or stoicism, where a battered hat became a crown of virtue, a sign of resolute endurance of a miserable life. Such fortitude found adherents especially in France with the Le Nain brothers, whose sympathies are evident in the realism of their painting now in the Louvre, where poor farmers are portrayed, in all their deprivation and sad acceptance of poverty.\r\nIn other cases, an insistent attention to the decorative value of tattered and patched clothes—torn caps and shoes, wrinkles, sagging cheeks—suggests a colder curiosity, a simple pleasure in the representation of the picturesque, and a willingness to caricature misery.\r\nAs this exhibition demonstrates, artists interpreted poverty in many ways. For Adriaen van Ostade, it sometimes became the equivalent (both in cause and consequence) of spiritual misery. For William Hogarth, it would lead to the social denunciation described in his famous satire Gin Lane (1751). Whether the emphasis was on debauchery or the delineation of a frayed hem, the work of Baroque-era artists found the poor to be rich subject matter indeed.",

    "exhibition_description": "Visions from the Forests: The Art of Liberia and Sierra Leone is the collection brought together between 1965 and 1987 by the late William Siegmann. Siegmann visited Liberia for the first time in 1965 to teach history. In the ensuing decades he lived on and off in Liberia for fifteen years, pursued a graduate degree in African art history at Indiana University, and was a major force behind the development of two museums in Liberia. During this time he developed a life-long passion – and formidable eye – for African art resulting in an extensive personal collection. In 1987 he became the Curator of African Art at the Brooklyn Museum of Art and continued research on his collection. Before he passed away in November 2011, Siegmann – a native of Minneapolis who had maintained strong connections with his hometown – started donating portions of his collection to various museums including the Minneapolis Institute of Arts.\r\nCovering a period from the fifteenth to the late twentieth centuries, with many examples from the nineteenth century, Visions from the Forests: The Art of Liberia and Sierra Leone will showcase approximately seventy-five pieces, created by artists from over a dozen different ethnic groups. Some of the highlights include: a Mano face mask with feathers and shoulder cap; a large horizontal mask from the Loma; a Vai helmet mask by an identified yet unnamed master carver from around 1900; a rare wooden female figure by a Sherbro artist; a brass tortoise cast by the famous Dan caster Ldamie of Gaple; a unique sixteenth century Sapi stone sculpture representing a seated couple; ceremonial horn pendants adorned with silver in which inscriptions in Arabic and Vai have been written; a late eighteenth century side-blown ivory horn from the Krim; a Temne chiefly hat in silver modeled after a fez; and a tie dyed wrapper designed by contemporary artist Christina Tombe.",

    "exhibition_description": "In collaboration with world-renowned English culinary historian Ivan Day, the Minneapolis Institute of Arts will present the exhibition, Supper with Shakespeare: The Evolution of English Banqueting, December 13, 2012 – March 31, 2013. The term “banquet” in the context of sixteenth and seventeenth century England meant a visually striking collection of after dinner sweet foods, preserves, and confections. In Shakespeare’s time (he died in 1616), such displays of culinary wonder were among the most magnificent in the history of British dining. Banquets were intended to impress and delight diners while the servants cleared the remains of the main feast, so they were often held in outdoor “banqueting houses” or in an intimate chamber such as the MIA’s Tudor Room. \r\nIn 1923, the Minneapolis Institute of Arts installed the Tudor Room as the museum's first period room, calling it \"the very embodiment of the spirit of the seventeenth century.\" Furnished with a rich assortment of tables, chairs, and case furniture that evoke the furnishings and lifestyle of Tudor England, the room’s oak paneling dates to about 1600. Once part of a private chamber used for eating, sitting, and entertaining guests, the room came to the MIA with a history of use in a manor in Suffolk, England. \r\nFor Supper with Shakespeare, the Tudor Room will be laid out with a full banquet of period culinary delights hand-crafted by Ivan Day. The exhibition will continue in the adjacent Briggs Court, featuring dining related objects of silver, ceramic, and glass from the MIA’s collection, as well as an assortment of loan objects such as period cookbooks, food moulds, and kitchen utensils. The whole will enchant art lovers and foodies alike! \r\nPlanned programs include a “Supper with Shakespeare” public lecture by guest curator Ivan Day on Thursday, December 13, 2012 at 11:00 am, sponsored by the Friends of the MIA; a private Tudor-inspired feast curated by Ivan Day, date TBD, complete with a special Tudor inspired ale locally brewed for the occasion; and",

    "exhibition_description": "For centuries, artists have explored the world of work and workers, creating enduring impressions of the challenges, triumphs, and life-affirming dignity of human labor. From romanticized visions of agrarian life, to sobering depictions of beleaguered manual laborers and miners, to scenes of worksites, factories, and industrial landscapes, these images reveal strikingly diverse interpretations of what it means to work. The subject is especially prevalent among graphic artists and photographers, who have exploited the power of reproduction to disseminate their ideas.\r\n\r\nSelected entirely from the MIA’s permanent collection, the exhibition showcases more than fifty original prints, drawings, and photographs by prominent American and international artists and photographers active from the mid-nineteenth century to the present. The selection will include important examples by Jean-François Millet, Auguste Lepere, Edgar Degas, Pierre Bonnard, James McNeill Whistler, Muirhead Bone, Käthe Kollwitz, Rockwell Kent, Romare Bearden, Lewis Hine, Joseph Pennell, Louis Lozowick, Joseph Stella, Charles Sheeler, Harry Sternberg, Grant Wood, John Steuart Curry, Elizabeth Catlett, W. Eugene Smith, David Parker, James Rosenquist, Jim Dine, Donald Sultan, Herb Ritts, Sebastião Salgado, and others.",

The outcome of this endeavor is not only an exhibition, but more importantly: an unvarnished series of interpretations that deal with the psychological phenomenon of selected memory and perception.\r\nBrewer will invite visitors to fill out a simple description form, a request to isolate one piece within the entire collection that has a personal resonance, and then put it into words. Patrons will fill out the description form, which will be provided at the entrance of each gallery. He will collect the forms each week and create replica of the works, based on the descriptions, to be executed in his studio. The editing process of the pieces will be organic and judicious and in consideration of the MAEP gallery space.The weight, history and origin of words will alone dictate the outcome of each piece.",

    "exhibition_description": "This exhibition commemorates the 100-year anniversary of the MIA’s crown jewel of Prairie School architecture, the Purcell-Cutts House, through a celebration of the design work of George Grant Elmslie (1869-1952). \r\n\r\nHaving worked for Louis Sullivan (1856-1924) for nearly twenty years, Elmslie became well-versed in organic design principles, carrying them over in the exceptional work of the Minneapolis firms of Purcell, Feick and Elmslie (1910-1913) and Purcell and Elmslie (1913-1921). His contributions to the integrated decorative schemes developed by the firms often included a combination of elements such as terra cotta, stained glass, stenciling, furniture, murals, and sawed wood, to create a harmonic whole greater than the sum of its parts. \r\n\r\nElmslie’s design drawing for the firm, rarely shown and minimally published, are delicate and beautiful studies, though they were meant to communicate to his partners and to the craftsmen who would execute these elements. The majority of these drawings are housed in the William Gray Purcell Papers at the Northwest Architectural Archives at the University of Minnesota. The exhibition will focus on the drawings as art objects, and as documents of the collaborative process of producing organic architecture. “The Progressive Pencil” would feature drawings for the Purcell-Cutts House and other notable Purcell and Elmslie projects such as the Merchants Bank of Winona, Minnesota (1911-13), along with historic photos and selected objects. Recent MIA acquisitions by Elmslie will also be featured, including the one-of-a-kind dining room suite for Mrs. Hanna (1915) with its wealth of detail. It will include approximately 15-20 of George Grant Elmslie’s elegant design drawings, alongside photos and related objects from the MIA and local collections. ",

    "exhibition_description": "During the 15th century, the bedroom was the most private and symbolic room in patrician homes. It was the locus of conception, birth, sickness, and death. \r\n\r\nLeon Battista Alberti (1404–1472), the famous architect and theorist of the Renaissance, in his book “On the Family” (1432), describes how the newlywed husband gave his bride a tour of the house, finally entering the bedroom and locking the door. But his next move did not involve the rustling of fabric and the exposure of flesh. Instead, Alberti’s groom shows his new bride all the valuables—silverware, tapestries, clothing, and gems, as well as the splendid furniture where all these things would be secured. This passage makes clear how important the bedroom was at that time—a space of family privacy and splendor.\r\n\r\nIn the most luxurious palaces, tapestries embellished the bedroom walls and helped to control temperature. A small altar for devotion was always present, often an image of the Virgin Mary with her child, propitious for childbearing. The rooms had no closets, and cupboards or armoires had not come into use; instead, chests were the means of storage. Such chests—cassoni in Italian—were richly decorated or painted with fables or episodes from the history. They were a fundamental item of home decoration and considered the most symbolic piece of furniture connected with marriage. Great attention was therefore paid to the subjects represented upon them, allusive to the husband’s qualities, to the wife’s chastity and obedience, and to the family’s glory and wealth. Scenes of battle—reminders of hard-won power or triumphant moral virtue—were favored, and one assumes that they were also entertaining conversation pieces.\r\n\r\nClothing, wedding gifts, family documents, and other treasures were locked up in the cassoni. Smaller elegant boxes contained jewelry, sewing kits, or other personal items. The bed—the focal point of the room, and a very monument to lineage and fertility—was a complex machine, often placed on a raised platform that in some cases was a",

They can change their colors and patterns instantly, whether for communicating or active camouflage, as their chromatophores (pigment-containing and light-reflecting parts of cells) are expanded or contracted.\r\nDuluth artist Ryuta Nakajima has been studying the color-changing physiology and behavior of cephalopods in Japan. Using waterproof images of artworks from the MIA’s collection, he has photographed cuttlefish responding to and attempting to replicate the colors and patterns of European paintings, Japanese prints, and Islamic decorations. Nakajima has also created plastic molds of small cuttlefish, which he will mass-produce and paint in various patterns that mimic and stylize the cephalopod color-changing properties. Nakajima likens them to collectible Japanese Kubrick dolls.",

All the drawings come from the MIA’s collection. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe exhibition includes 100 drawings executed in a variety of media by a range of artists, including Ludovico Carracci, Baldassare Franceschini, Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo, Antoine Watteau, Jean-Honoré Fragonard, Jean-Baptiste Greuze, Jacques-Louis David, Pierre Paul Prud’hon, Anne-Louis Girodet, Eugène Delacroix, Thomas Gainsborough, George Romney, Edouard Vuillard, Edgar Degas, Eva Gonzales, Henri Matisse, Lovis Corinth, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Käthe Kollwitz, Otto Mueller, Emil Nolde, Egon Schiele, Piet Mondrian, Edward Hopper, John Marin, Grant Wood, Roy Lichtenstein, Jasper Johns, Andy Warhol, and Edward Ruscha.",

It was Henri Matisse (French, 1869-1954) who had the most significant and lasting influence on these young American painters. This exhibition will examine how Matisse's art influenced American painters to revise their thinking about color and form, challenging the tradition of representational painting in the United States.",

Their innovative contemporary work highlights the international reach of the African continent, featuring the rich exchange of African creativity with global cultures, periods, and styles.",

    "exhibition_description": "Shells are among the first items a child collects, instinctively, while walking on a beach. Shells are common, abundant and, at the same time, can be precious and extremely desirable. Their sound, when drawn to the ears, is the evocative, infinite sound of the waves.\r\nFrom the islands of the Pacific to African villages, from prehistoric shacks to the most sophisticated courts of Baroque Europe, the shells’ translucent texture and their complex and fantastic forms can be recognized in everyday objects, in decorative patterns, in figurative symbols and in an incredible variety of art works.\r\nShells assume a primary position in the naturalistic studies of the modern era, along with the discovery of new lands, and the improvement of optical instruments. Their forms attest not only to the perfection and magnificence of creation, but also visually make manifest mathematical logarithms; they also bring to life, and help to solve, the religious drama of the evolutionary problem.\r\nCollecting shells can also be an expensive mania, as the first Mannerist Wunderkammern testify. There, nautilus and conches were mounted in precious metals, adorned with gems, “portrayed” by painters in still lifes, and displayed in magnificent cabinets—a pride of place in keeping with the importance of shells as an important field of naturalistic studies. \r\nMinneapolis and its surrounding area possess various treasures contained in the Minneapolis Institute of Arts and public libraries, including the Wangensteen Historical Library and the James Ford Bell Library—which, together, represent an immense patrimony of prints and precious antique books on natural history. \r\nThe exhibition encompasses the passion for shells from the Wunderkammer to the post-Linnaean era. A small section is devoted to the still nowadays never-extinguished fever of shell-collecting.",

    "exhibition_description": "Two different approaches to understanding and depicting nature melded—with beguiling results—as the long interlacing of British and Indian cultures on the subcontinent came to a head in the 17th and 18th centuries, an uneasy period of spreading colonial rule. This exhibition showcases these unique representations of nature, commissioned from Indian artists by Indian princes and increasingly powerful European colonial patrons—an artistic and scientific confluence that forever reshaped the way we view the natural world.At the heart of the exhibition are 10 “Lady Impey” paintings on loan from Bill Clark. A British colonialist in Calcutta, Lady Mary Impey commissioned Indian painters to illustrate birds from her private menagerie, resulting in more than 200 images that owe as much to European natural science as India’s rich painterly tradition.",

    "exhibition_description": "Childs will present a new series of hyper-realistic & finely details paintings, based on his own photographs that are a rejoinder to contemporary attitudes about beauty in painting. He has done this by carefully choosing images that both test the limits of what is an acceptable level of sentimentality for critical art, and offer visual pleasures that also contain sensations of alienation and loss. With a relatively small number of works, \"How to Make a World\" is meant to engage the various and contradicting claims made on painting regarding beauty, artistic merit, and its relevance as a medium. \r\nThe driving principle of Jonathan Bruce Williams MAEP exhibition will be to display the science and technology of vision. He creates fascinating sculptural installations that re-present digital and analog images and \"utilize photography as a technical and philosophical strategy.\" Most recently, he has been interested in ocular phenomena such as the persistence of vision, linear perspective and the stereoscopic illusion. For example, images will flicker, flash and appear stereoscopically with the aid of new and vintage machinery. Compositional elements, such as the symbolism of Americana and the history of photography, create formal affinities between the beacon of a lighthouse and a movie projector, or a picket fence and a zoetrope.",

    "exhibition_description": "This exhibition looks at the explosion of creativity in Finnish design from the last fifteen years. Nearly every aspect of life in Finland incorporates thoughtful design thinking, and sensitivity to form and material. The name Designed Environments reflects the many aspects touched by design in Finland today, from home interiors, to the body, to city streets, to food.\r\nFinland: Designed Environments presents a selection of the most elegant, artistic, and thought-provoking objects and projects by Finnish designers, craftspeople, and architects. These objects share an inherent practicality, but are thoughtfully designed for an elevation of the user’s experience. Strong undercurrents in the exhibition include: the use of natural and local materials; respect for and closeness to nature, with an ecological emphasis; a high level of quality in all aspects; and a sense of wonder. Finland: Designed Environments is the first significant museum-organized exhibition outside Finland since the 1990s to examine the breadth of current Finnish design.\r\nThe exhibition Finland: Designed Environments will encompass furnishings, fashion, and craft, as well as architecture and urbanism. It will also address emerging and noteworthy areas of sensory design, graphic design, and systems design, as well as the intersection of design and food, all actively being addressed by Finland’s design community. Drawing upon the richness of the forward-thinking design community in Finland, the exhibition includes a number of projects that were a part of World Design Capital Helsinki 2012 (a bi-annual international designation awarded by the International Council of Societies of Industrial Design).

A picture of a child breastfeeding. Ants carrying a grain of sugar. A tiny chrysalis on a blade of grass. She views the world with a playful, thought-provoking, and critically detached curiosity.\r\nKawauchi is also well known for her photography books, which present an evocative sequence of images unfolding on every spread. She has produced 15 photo books since 2001, including Light and Shadow (2012) and Illuminance, Ametsuchi, Seeing Shadow (2012). Now living and working in Tokyo, Kawauchi has exhibited around the world, including a recent solo exhibition at the prestigious Tokyo Metropolitan Museum of Photography in 2012.",

His fascinating MAEP exhibition will present a running text of Henry David Thoreau’s \"Walden\" on a set of highway message boards. By converting this classic meditation on the beauty of wilderness and creative isolation into tiny 3-line bits of text, Rutter’s installation will conflate the private and slow-paced act of reading with the fast-lane drive through the natural landscape. It will also reflect on the Rutter’s understanding of transcendentalist philosophy, which he links to American values of individualism, car culture and exploration. ",

    "exhibition_description": "Henri Matisse (French, 1969-1954) was one of the most influential artists of the 20th century, whose stylistic innovations fundamentally altered the course of modern art. In a career spanning six decades, his achievements in painting, sculpture, drawing, graphic arts, book illustration and paper cutouts earned the acclaim of collectors, critics and several generations of younger artists.\r\nMatisse initially trained as a lawyer before developing an interest in art. He moved to Paris to study painting in 1891. He followed the traditional academic path first at the Académie Julian and then at the École des Beaux Arts, but he also discovered a dynamic and experimental contemporary Parisian art scene. He began to experiment with a diversity of styles to create his own pictorial language. In 1905, Matisse exhibited at the Salon d’Automne with André Derain, and their shockingly bold experiments with using color to structure their paintings brought them the derisive nickname “Les Fauves” (Wild Beasts). Across a succession of stylistic periods, Matisse aimed to discover the “essential character of things” through art that expressed balance and serenity, as he explained in his Notes of a Painter (1908).\r\nThis sweeping exhibition features fifty paintings and sculptures and thirty works on paper spanning six decades of Henri Matisse’s prolific career. Drawn entirely from The Baltimore Museum of Art’s permanent collection, one of the most comprehensive collections of Matisse’s work in the world, this exhibition provides a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for a regional community to share in the beauty of such a magnificent body of work.\r\nIn addition to Matisse: Masterworks from The Baltimore Museum of Art are four exhibitions of outstanding works from the collection of the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, all of them created or inspired by Matisse.\r\nChasing Matisse: American Moderns Under the Influence, Gallery 361\r\nMore Matisse, Please: Drawings and Prints, Gallery 369\r\nMore Matisse, Please: Book Illustration, Gallery 359\r\nMore ",

    "exhibition_description": "Artists have long been drawn to the complicated murk of murder, from the biblical and quranic stories of Cain and Abel (the first murderer and first victim), to the horrific deaths of Jesus and early Christian martyrs, to gut-wrenching accounts of modern-day homicide.\r\nMurder is inevitably traumatic, a tragic narrative unfolding from the crime to its consequences. It is this story, whether arising from persecution, criminal intent, or a depraved sense of passion, that artists find so intriguing.\r\n Today, with murder constantly in the news—if it bleeds, it leads—and saturating our entertainment, from video games to mystery novels, we may be desensitized to its frightening reality. And yet our fascination with the ultimate crime endures, suggesting a primal need to grapple with its brutal truth. Artists, too, feel compelled to explore this meaning, as seen in the works here.\r\nThis exhibition was drawn from the MIA’s permanent collection of graphic Art and photography, and was complemented by key loans from private collectors.",

Feeling.\" G.U.T. or grand unified theory, is a new photographic installation that revels in the absurdity of intuitive actions and the visual organization of science's grandest theories. Formal echoes in dozens of his photographs, collected from his own scientific experiments and found-footage research, bridge the gap between the epic and the mundane without proving a thing. Two gallery-length tables will emphasize the connection between his photographs and the wonderfully obsolete technologies that have been used to visualize scientific observation.

    "exhibition_description": "\"In the 1980s and 90s I photographed structures that we South Africans had made during the Era of Baasskap, that time, from about 1660 until 1990, in which Whites gradually came to exert dominion over all of South Africa and its peoples. It was the values we had expressed in those structures that I sought and attempted to elicit in photographs and text.\r\n\r\nBeginning in 1999 – four years after the first democratic elections brought Nelson Mandela to power - and continuing into the present, I have engaged in a similar photography of some of the structures that have emerged with our democracy and that I believe are expressive of values in this new, still nascent and yet in many ways old way of being in our society.\r\n\r\nThe photographs exhibited here are from these two separate yet intimately connected bodies of work.\" - David Goldblatt, July 2014\r\n\r\nOne of the preeminent photographers working today, David Goldblatt has received the Hasselblad Award, the Henri Cartier-Bresson Award and the ICP Lifetime Achievement Award. In America, his work has been the subject of solo exhibitions at the Museum of Modern Art (1999), the New Museum (2009), and the Jewish Museum (2010). His work has been exhibited extensively in Europe and South Africa. Some 20 books have been published by and about his work.",

By building up then surgically peeling back the layers of his paintings and sculptures, he is looking for a glimpse into past experiences. Unfinished wood frames, sheets of plastic, and raw building materials, expertly and quickly composed, have a strong visual language but they also show Holberg's interest in concepts of absence, transparency and recovery. These paintings and a new site-specific installation mark a dramatic change from his earlier work, especially his evolving interest in how art’s relationship to architecture is an opportunity to understand how fragmentary perceptions are the grist for memory and behavior.",

At the end of the period known as the ‘Twilight of the Medici’ (exhibition title, Detroit 1974), this iconographically unusual ensemble refers back to Michelangelo’s cycle in the New Scristy of San Lorenzo, and to several other painted and sculpted masterworks of the Baroque period. Moreover, it demonstrates that Florentine bronze sculpture did not end with Giovanni Battista Foggini, Massimiliano Soldani Benzi, and Antonio Montauti, but Pietro Cipriani this cycle – together with the copies after the Antique recently acquired by the J. Paul Getty Museum and in a private collection in England – it reveals that Pietro Cipriano was the last master of European rank and influence active in this field. Differently from the four copies after the antique from the Macclesfield collection, the six reliefs however are new and highly successful inventions, which were celebrated at the time, as attested, for instance, by copies in Doccia porcelain.",

It may appear that the bricks and hero’s face in “When You’re Dead, You’re Dead” are cut, then pasted, but each detail is meticulously handpainted. Gallery walls covered floor to ceiling with sheets of 16-bit brick vinyl wallpaper will complement the paintings.",

These galleries feature the strengths of his collection and his favorites: nudes, circus performers, social themes, landscapes and seascapes, abstraction, and portraits. It’s the whole story of American art, thoroughly and engagingly told in just a slice of a much larger collection—a credit to Kunin’s discerning eye and his irrepressible love of the chase after great art.",

The five new short videos in “Inventory,” which include actors, puppets and diegetic voices, are rendered in her irresistible style. A church and grocery store are just a few of the stages in Super Bowl Sunday, Pizza, and Shrine, each of which are based on poignantly personal vignettes from her Massachusetts hometown. The gallery will include sculptures from the videos that are particularly strong narrative devices and have a presence Swiszcz describes as “quietly devout.” “Inventory” is the first installment of an ongoing project that will develop over the next few years. Swiszcz has been featured in recent group and one-person exhibitions at venues including the Minneapolis Institute of Art and Highpoint Center for Printmaking.",

Based on sketches made along the way, Hiroshige later created one of the world’s most celebrated and artistically influential series of woodblock prints. Nearly 160 years later, Gus Foster, an American panoramic landscape photographer, was determined to retrace Hiroshige’s footsteps. His 360° photographs, taken while walking the entire 306 mile route, strikingly document Japan’s metamorphosis in the twentieth century. This exhibition paired each artists’ conception of the fifty-three “stations” of the Tokaido, revealing not only radical changes in Japan’s topography, but also the vast differences between artists’ inspiration, materials and creative interpretation.",

    "exhibition_description": "It’s an art nearly as old as civilization itself. Since the Neolithic era, artisans in East Asia have coated bowls, cups, boxes, baskets, and other utilitarian objects with a natural polymer distilled from the sap of the rhus verniciflua, known as the lacquer tree. Lacquerware was—and still is—prized for its sheen, a lustrous beauty that artists learned to accentuate over the centuries with inlaid gold, silver, mother-of-pearl, and other precious materials.\r\nSince the late 1980s, this tradition has been challenged. A small but enterprising circle of lacquer artists have pushed the medium in entirely new and dynamic directions by creating large-scale sculptures, works that are both conceptually innovative and superbly exploitive of lacquer’s natural virtues. Thirty works by 16 artists comprise the first-ever comprehensive exhibition of contemporary Japanese lacquer sculpture. They have all been drawn from the Clark Collections at Mia, the only collection in the world to feature this extraordinary new form.",

The Habsburgs called the leading artists of their time, such as Giorgione, Raphael, Titan, and Holbein, to their court to create works that would propagate their glory and splendor. This stunning exhibition will highlight the spectacle of the Hapsburg court, including carriages and court costumes that have never before traveled to the US.",

With more than 12,000 images in the collection of the Department of Photography and New Media, the hard part was choosing one from each year! Some years were easier than others: 1916 offered just five works, while 1993 had 333.\r\n\r\nThe resulting exhibition reveals something wonderfully idiosyncratic: freed from the narrative traditions of photographic history, yet tied to the collecting habits and tastes of MIA curators.\r\n\r\nBut what about the +? The MIA’s interest in photography reaches back to 1903, before this building—or the MIA itself—even existed. Known then as the Minneapolis Society of Fine Art, this precursor held its first photography exhibition in the Minneapolis Public Library at 1834 Emerson Avenue North. It would be another 70 years before the MIA established its Department of Photography, in 1972.\r\nIn the spirit of “100+”, you are invited to share your favorite photos from any year of your life. Simply post your photo to Twitter or Instagram using #tbtMIA. Your photos will appear on a screen outside the Harrison Photography Gallery throughout the run of the exhibition.",

This means she draws equally from thrift store treasures, a wry sense of humor, and found objects that only be described as “suburban sublime.” For those already familiar with her work, these newest pieces will show how she is making an important shift to a human-scale and working more quickly. Since her use of art historical concepts such as ready-made and recycling are so elastic she can develop forms that become endearingly awkward and self-effacing. “Feelings” is the head of a sad-eyed dog figurine, the top portion of which seamlessly transitions into her sculpted, oversized lower body. The exaggerated scale is funny and pathetic",

In the 1960s, the CIA enlisted Hmong and Laotian soldiers to fight a secret war alongside the conflict in Vietnam, soldiers the United States still does not recognize as U.S. veterans despite their sacrifices on behalf of the U.S.. The men that Her has photographed, in the tradition of classical paintings of generals, are veterans of that war—excluded from subsidized health services, refused the right to be buried in national cemeteries, and disqualified from wearing U.S.–sanctioned military uniforms and medals.\r\nHere, they stand proudly. These Hmong Army veterans have awarded one another medals based on their oral testimony. Her sees these portraits as neither advocacy nor criticism. The installation magnifies a particular effort in our common hope to be recognized.",

In this exhibition, precious, rare volumes from the early 16th to the 18th century, on loan from the Wangensteen Bio-Medical Library, join artists’ manuals, drawings, and prints from the MIA Prints & Drawing collection, and a skeleton and skulls from the Science Museum of Minnesota, to celebrate the glory of the human body.",

    "exhibition_description": "This first-look exhibition of over 100 highlights from the Clark Collections, recently acquired by the MIA, offers unusually rich and personal insights into the scope of Japanese art and the nature of connoisseurship. Bill and Libby Clark amassed one of the world’s finest collections of Japanese art according to their own finely honed interests, instincts, and idiosyncrasies. Not trends. Not markets. Not a particular time, place, or medium. They collected what they liked—what drew their audacious eyes.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis exhibition hints at the stunning variety and bold taste that accorded the Clarks’ endeavor, begun in the late 1970s, a kind of legendary status. Tucked in the agricultural valley of central California, their collection grew from frequent trips to Japan, stoking their enthusiasm for Japanese aesthetics—their home is a blend of Japanese and California Arts and Crafts styles. The combined collection of the Clarks and the Clark Center for Japanese Art & Culture reached almost 1,700 objects, ranging across 10 centuries and from paintings to sculpture, ceramics to textiles, woodblock prints to works of bamboo. They include important examples from every school of painting in Japan since the 16th century and from some of its most acclaimed living artists, including 80 pieces by ceramist Fukami Sueharu—the largest assembly of his sleek bluish-white porcelain in the world.",

    "exhibition_description": "Though we connect with friends and family across the world by our voices, texts, and images, Shana Kaplow’s Near and Far explores the interconnectivity we share through our things. Kaplow focuses on the common chair to bring our attention to the products that fill our home, and asks whether a community can develop around the global reach of a shared commodity. Using ink on paper to conflate chair designs from both ancient China and modern Ikea—which depends on Chinese mass-manufacturing—Kaplow’s techniques of abstraction and photorealism stress the tension of connecting with the unfamiliar.\r\nKaplow also uses video to find connections between cultures, nations, and physical architectures. As part of her 2010 Red Gate International Artists Residency, she traveled to Beijing and recorded Chinese commuters as they passed her in the subway or below her balcony. When covered by projections of Kaplow’s video footage, the gallery walls become windows, and we can see the world as connected by more than our chairs.",

Its unique character has developed from such factors as its early geographical isolation from the North, its difficult legacy of slavery, its gripping summertime heat and humidity, its enduring hospitality, and the international flavor of some of its cities. Indigenous and visiting photographers have captured enduring images of the landscape, architecture, and inhabitants of Dixie, from the time of the Civil War up to the present. E. J. Bellocq, for instance, sensitively portrayed women in the red-light district of New Orleans a century ago. Walker Evans made many of his iconic Depression-era images in the South. Danny Lyon documented the turbulent Civil Rights Movement there. And contemporary photographers like our own Alec Soth have been drawn to the mysterious ways of everyday Southern folk. The diverse work of these and many other photographers will present a rich collage of this southern sensibility. The exhibition will include about 75 photographs, drawn entirely from the MIA’s permanent collection.",

This exhibition features a range of classic masterpieces from the MIA’s collection that document photographers’ new encounters with foreign subjects and lands. The exhibition looks closely at how photographers translate a sense of culture, people, and place through imagery. It considers the power of photographic first impressions to shape historical representations of cultures that become lasting records of historical memory.",

Yet what seemed like the end of a unique art form, without parallel in the world, was actually the beginning of another, as the path was cleared for a new kind of print: shin hanga. \r\n\r\nIn the 1910s, a few painters began to design prints that included much stronger references to Western aesthetics, painting styles, and techniques. Spurred on by the entrepreneurial publisher Watanabe Shōzaburō (1885–1962), artists like Hashiguchi Goyō (1880–1921) began to create portraits of beautiful women, prints that early on were particularly cherished by foreign collectors. These shin hanga were produced in unconventional paper formats, different sizes than those typically used for ukiyo-e, signaling a clear break with the past. Also, instead of printing thousands of copies, as was common with ukiyo-e, publishers produced shin hanga in more limited quantities, ranging from editions of 350 to as little as 29.\r\n\r\nSeven Masters focuses on seven artists who played a significant role in the development of the new print and are noteworthy representatives of this new print movement. Drawing from the collection of Ellen and Fred Wells at the Minneapolis Institute of Art, the exhibition features the spectacular beauty portraits of Hashiguchi Goyō, Itō Shinsui (1898–1972), Yamakawa Shūhō (1898–1944), and Torii Kotondo (1900–1976), the striking actors of Yamamura Toyonari (Kōka; 1886–1942) and Natori Shunsen (1886–1960), as well as the evocative landscapes of Kawase Hasui (1883–1957). \r\n\r\nPencil drawings and rare printing proofs offer insights into the production of woodblock prints, and, as these seven artists were painters as well as print designers, a selection of paintings offers a glimpse of their multiple talents.",

Muybridge, working in the 1880s at the University of Pennsylvania, produced sequential images of humans and animals doing the mundane and the arcane. Edgerton, working in the middle of this century at MIT, experimented with early flash technology to freeze spectacular moments like a bullet shattering a light bulb. The exhibition included about 75 photographs (divided equally between the two), all drawn from the MIA’s permanent collection.",

These are watercolors, pastels, gouaches, charcoals, and ink drawings that are rarely exhibited out of concern for their light-sensitive materials. But now special new lighting in Gallery 353 is allowing the museum to show these works more routinely. This selection pays tribute to trees, variously interpreted as dancing, frightening, chatty, wily, and close to perfection. Some works entered the collection only in the last several years, including mouthwatering watercolors by Auguste Lepère, Charles Burchfield, and Childe Hassam, and this delicate bit of poetry by the impressive Dutch landscapist Egbert van Drielst.",

One story is that of the collector, Martin Weinstein, a kid from Brooklyn, a sports fanatic, a teacher, a family man, and a prominent attorney, who discovers his passion for photography in the early 1970s and builds an outstanding collection. The other story is that of the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, a museum that recognizes the power of photography as “the leading and only popular visual means” in the 1970s. A third story is of a curator, the late Carroll T. Hartwell (known as Ted), the MIA’s founding curator of photography, and his long-standing friendship with Martin. And, finally, the most important story is that of a collection, the MIA’s photography and new media collection, which brings international photography to Minnesotans.",

From 1889 until his death in 1954, Matisse made thousands of drawings, prints, paintings, and sculptures of women. He was following a timeless tradition that also animated many of his contemporaries. This exhibition presents a varied selection of two dozen prints and drawings, primarily by French, German, and American artists, all focused on the feminine. Some of the artists intentionally introduced radical distortions into their work for expressive purposes. Matisse attempted to capture his sublimated desire for his models. Others sought to reveal the intimate or inner world of women.",

Today, to make it absolutely new is almost impossible given the sheer quantity of art produced since Pound’s slogan. Still, contemporary artists certainly make art that is new, again. And historic artworks acquire new meanings in our time. This photography exhibition will feature a selection of recent museum acquisitions by Richard Avedon, Stan Douglas, Marco Breuer, and Margaret Bourke-White, among others – many will be presented in the MIA galleries for the first time – in an innovative installation that reveals how powerful images acquire new and provocative meanings in different historical situations.",

    "exhibition_description": "Eugène Delacroix was the very engine of revolution that helped transform the art of French painting in the nineteenth century. At his death in 1863, he was the most revered artist in Paris. The younger generation of painters from Edgar Degas to Vincent van Gogh scrambled to pay homage to his achievement and to explore his aesthetic theories, as articulated in his life’s work, much of which was accessible to the public, and in his incisive critical writings. If he was often described appropriately as the last painter of the Grand Style, he was equally one of the first modern masters and arguably the most influential artist of his epoch.\r\n This exhibition will investigate, through various thematic groupings of pictures, how and why this was so. The themes will range over some of the following: orientalism; color theory; religious and history painting at a crossroads; beasts, flowers and aestheticism; “musical” painting; and the artist’s own unpublished “Dictionary of Art.” \r\nIn addition to Delacroix, the exhibition will include works by Cézanne, Van Gogh, Gauguin, Renoir, and others.\r\nA significant number of paintings from the Minneapolis Institute of Art will form the core of the show, including Delacroix’s Fanatics of Tangiers, generally considered one of the principal masterworks by the artist in North America, van Gogh’s brilliant Olive Trees, and Signac’s initial pointillist work Snow, Boulevard de Clichy.",

Each print, drawing, and painting becomes a window onto a familiar but undefinable scene that has the potential for infinite narratives.",

The MIA will highlight the breadth of this gift by presenting an exhibition that features more than 170 masterpieces of Japanese and Korean art, ranging from prehistoric to the late 19th century. Among the objects are stunning ink paintings like Kichizan Mincho's (1352–1431) interpretation of the bodhisattva Monju by the artist, a 16th-century water jar (mizusashi) known as \"Burst Bag\" from the kilns in Iga for use in tea ceremony, a pair of folding screens of hollyhocks and plum trees by the artist Ogata Kenzan (1663–1743), a pair of screens of Chinese children playing \"crack the whip\" and examining an elephant by the eccentric artist Nagasawa Rosetsu (1754–1799), and a luminous 12th-century celadon Korean maebyong vessel inlaid with a pattern ofa crane amid clouds.

Aquatint, an etching technique developed in the late 18th century, introduces a porous ground to the printing plate through the application of resin that is fused to the plate before it is etched in the acid bath. The inked porous ground produces an effect akin to wash or watercolor, which artists have exploited to dramatic, evocative ends. The show features a range of works, from innovative early examples of the technique by Francisco Goya and Jean-Baptiste Le Prince to haunting, spectacular images from the 20th century by Otto Dix and Pablo Picasso.",

Whether jolly, wondrous, or slightly menacing, his drawings are meticulously executed and full of absorbing detail. There are goblins, wizards, trolls, elves, animals, and pathways amid craggy trees. It is a nostalgic world of imagination and intimate communication between generations as old readers and young come together to reinvent the stories for themselves.\r\n\r\nThis exhibition will include 40-50 framed watercolors, drawings, pastels, and prints and will be presented in ways friendly to both adults and children. A highly desirable feature for the installation will be an 18” high riser that will run in front of most of the fairytale drawings so that both children and adults will be able to see them at about eye level",

Industrial growth, unprecedented scientific and technological developments, and progressive social and financial reforms resulted in a higher standard of living, an expanded middle class, and greater levels of self-determination for both men and women. At the same time, global wars, economic depression, and racial and religious conflict produced suffering for many. These turbulent decades prompted insightful, often impassioned, responses from American artists whose perspectives conveyed many of the hopes, dreams, and fears of the public at large. This exhibition presents more than 45 original prints, drawings, and watercolors by such leading figures as John Sloan, George Bellows, Charles Burchfield, Thomas Hart Benton, John Steuart Curry, Grant Wood, Rockwell Kent, Reginald Marsh, Leo Katz, Elizabeth Catlett, Rico Lebrun, Ben Shahn, and many more.",

    "exhibition_description": "A pair of two silver statues by Neapolitan artist Giuseppe Sanmartino (1720-1793), donated to the museum by long-time trustees Al and Mary Agnes McQuinn, marks one of the most important additions to Mia's silver collection. Executed with amazing detail, the statues testify to a devotion to the two Archangels, which goes back to the Early Christian period, and continues to flourish in Southern Italy (as well as in the Greek and Russian Orthodox churches) to the present day. Throughout Christianity, Saint Michael and Saint Raphael are venerated for their healing powers. The exhibition celebrates the acquisition of these unique masterpieces, whose only comparables remain in Italian churches, but which have no parallels in any American museum collection.",

Shaped by an interest in queer archival practices, his sculptures originate from collections of donated objects such as toothbrushes, socks and underwear and become minimalist monuments to bodies and their detritus. His exhibition detaches grooming from the realm of the private and the domestic into the communal. Ramstad’s exhibition includes darning lessons in the Period Rooms and a daily sock sorting in the gallery.",

    "exhibition_description": "Lindsay Rhyner’s textile wall hangings are loosely based on found-photographs and postcards from the 1940’s. The imagery depicted in the postcards and photographs is of a seemingly idyllic time. Pictures of exotic places, agriculture, war, tourism and monuments were rendered in oversaturated color and rigid composition. A window to a perfect world which never existed. By translating these worlds into fabric and using reflective materials, like sequins, reflective fabrics, and rhinestones, Rhyner forces us to look beyond the frozen image and to take a closer look at the materiality of the wall hangings themselves.",

Artists and designers, inspired by innovations such as radios, skyscrapers, and even the development of modern psychology, responded with cutting-edge representations of new and familiar subjects.\r\n“International Modernism” explores how this response to modern life evolved through much of the 20th century, from the 1910s through the early 1960s. Installed in stages from fall 2015 through mid-2016, “International Modernism” centers on objects from the Kunin Collection as well as paintings, prints, photography, and design from Mia’s collection.",

Other masks, with their pleasing features and colorful cloth, are meant to be fancy. These awe-inspiring, unconventional masks dance in the streets of Freetown, a major port city and the capital of Sierra Leone. They belong to the members of local youth associations—the urban successors to social groups that originated among freed and resettled African captives in the 1800s—who wear them to entertain during weddings and public holidays.\r\nThe masks reveal this eclectic legacy, borrowing from various masking traditions and exhibiting a multitude of ethnic and religious influences. Whether fierce or fancy, these modern masks are like stylistic collages, celebrating the continuous reinvention of traditional art.",

    "exhibition_description": "James Charles Castle (1899-1977) was a self-taught American artist who lived his entire life in rural Idaho. Born profoundly deaf, he grew up in a small farming community surrounded by family members (including seven surviving siblings), but remained socially isolated due to his inability to communicate with others. Despite attending school for the hearing-impaired as a child, he never learned to speak or sign. Castle lived at home with his parents until their death, and then with other family members until his own death in 1977. He never married, nor had any children of his own. In addition to farming, his parents owned a small-town general store and operated the local post office. It was in this environment that Castle discovered his need and acumen for personal expression. The materials, subjects, and sentiments of his art were born of everyday life experience. \r\nHis collages, constructions and bound books consist largely of repurposed scrap materials, often stitched together with lengths of string or ribbon, and sometimes combined with hand-drawn designs and lettering. He made countless drawings on waste paper or commercial packaging, using a range of media that included ink made from stove soot and spit, and watercolor solutions he contrived by grinding and soaking color reproductions cut from magazines and other printed material. As a result, Castle’s drawings and constructions possess a material ingenuity and an engaging improvisational spirit that define his creative vision. His work is generally representational, though many of his constructions are highly abstract and only hint at their real-world inspiration. Castle occasionally produced non-representational drawings, whose subjects may in fact be merely unidentified. Above all, his work reveals a compelling and persistent inner need for personal expression. ",

    "exhibition_description": "In a serendipitous merging of events, the Army put a talented artist-soldier named Seth Eastman at Fort Snelling in the 1830s and 1840s, when Native life was still intact around the Upper Mississippi. Captain Eastman spent his long assignment transfixed by Native ways, and he produced the most frank and intimate—if slightly romantic—record of Native people in pre-territorial Minnesota. Mia is extraordinarily fortunate that the W. Duncan and Nivin MacMillan Foundation has given Mia 35 of Eastman’s historic watercolors and drawings, most based on his Minnesota sketches. Among these small, detailed gems are Indian Sugar Camp and Gathering Wild Rice, believed to be the first-ever images of harvesting maple syrup and wild rice. Eastman’s quiet observations are especially evident in Dakotah Encampment, which reveals wonderful details of tipi construction.",

Spectacular works from Luther’s personal possessions, paintings and prints by the extraordinary master Lucas Cranach, fabulous objects wrought in silver and gold, and sumptuous embroideries will be among the objects revealing the artistic, spiritual, and intellectual vitality of the time.\r\nThe Minneapolis Institute of Art has been selected as the exclusive U.S. venue to showcase this stunning exhibition of over 100 objects. This opportunity is being made possible due to the closing of the Luther House in Wittenberg in 2016 to undertake renovations in preparation for the Jubilee Year in 2017. The inventory of the Luther House, which is the world’s largest Reformation history museum, has never been on tour in such a comprehensive manner. The German government has fully endorsed the project, in recognition of its importance, and with the certainty that visitors will come away with a tangible awareness of this pivotal moment in history—a moment when a man took a stand that turned the world upside down.",

By diverting the boundaries of a space, Sexton enables us to mistrust artifice and seek what exists when the seams surrounding us become malleable to our perceptions. Places become like people, with walls that are permeable, fallible, sometimes scarred, yet, deep within lies the perfect ideology of geometry and nature.",

Andrus III had a particular passion for these small-scale marvels, and now selected works from his exceptional collection are being unveiled in Gallery 344. They are part of a generous gift of more than 230 works from John and Marion Andrus’s three daughters, Elizabeth, Julie, and Catherine. \r\nThis display focuses on prints from the 16th and 17th centuries. Most are no bigger than a credit card. Some, like Rembrandt’s Goldsmith, have an intimate, personal feel. Other prints began life as ornamental designs for sheaths or brooches. A series of tiny religious scenes by Jacques Callot were meant to be used as paper substitutes for pilgrim badges. The German Kleinmeister, or Little Masters—followers of Albrecht Dürer—executed diminutive gems with uncommon charm, playfulness, and technical refinement, as exemplified by this Italianate nude. Come enter this world of tiny treasures, and little by little they will take your breath away.",

Epitomized by the radical experiments of artist Georg Baselitz, German Neo-Expressionism has been described as bold, raw, brutish, spontaneous, messy, vital, emotional, sensual, antimodern, antiprogressive, and at times even nihilistic.",

    "exhibition_description": "In her works of photography, sculpture, and video, Leslie Hewitt pushes the limits of form to take on multiple meanings and considerations, and examines individual and collective relationships to memory, history, and time. Showcasing her recent work, “New Pictures: Leslie Hewitt, A Series of Projections” features a two-channel film installation, Untitled (Structures) (2012); photographs—A Series of Projections (2010) and Untitled (Abloom) from Blue Skies, Warm Sunlight Studies (2012); and a photolithograph, Flowers (2013).\r\n\r\nUntitled (Structures) responds to an archive of civil rights-era photographs housed at the Menil Collection in Houston. Commissioned by the Menil, the Des Moines Art Center, and the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago, the double channel film installation presents a series of silent vignettes shot at locations in Chicago, Memphis, and the Arkansas Delta—places profoundly influenced by the Great Migration and the Civil Rights Movement—as well as body movements that represent those of black migrants and protesters. Posing critical questions of the historicity and relevance of the archive and documentary photographic modes, Untitled (Structures) explores multiple ideas, exposing the tensions between still photography and the cinematic experiences of moving images, between the corporeal and the architectonic, between the past and the present, and between the physical and the psychological.\r\n\r\nThe high-resolution projectors used in the exhibition are generously provided by Canon U.S.A., Inc.",

    "exhibition_description": "Renowned as an industrial designer, Minol Araki (1928–2010) was also a prolific painter with a firm grounding in East Asian painting traditions. Born in China to Japanese parents, and active professionally in New York and Taipei, Araki created an immense body of ink paintings that reimagined tradition and straddled East and West.\r\n\r\nThis exhibition is organized around five mid-career, large-scale works—monumental compositions, each of which stretches more than 70 feet—depicting landscapes, dragons, snow monkeys, and lotus ponds. Each painting is complemented by early and late works that marry influences as disparate as the eccentric Chinese painter Bada Shanren (c. 1626–1705), the Lithuanian-American artist Ben Shahn (1898–1969), Araki’s mentor, the renowned Chinese traditionalist painter Zhang Daqian (1899–1983), and medieval Japanese Zen painters.",

    "exhibition_description": "This exhibition presents a brief history of photography through selections from Mia’s collection of 12,500 photographs. Acting as “windows” on scenes that likely would have remained unseen without the benefits of photographic technology, the images reflect the medium’s ability to turn the familiar or hidden into unfamiliar, thought-provoking, evocative, and even iconic moments. Challenging a linear history of photography that began in the 1820s, this collection suggests the timelessness and timeliness of the images’ subjects as well as the global transmission and dissemination of the medium.",

    "exhibition_description": "A horse is the projection of peoples' dreams about themselves—strong, powerful, beautiful—and it has the capability of giving us escape from our mundane existence. – Pam Brown\r\n \r\nFor more than 500 years, horses have been favorite subjects for artists and their patrons. In the prints, drawings, and artists’ books featured in this exhibition, horses take on many roles. They carry riders, propel vehicles, run freely through the landscape or within the confines of the race track, battle heroically, and sometimes fall tragically. They are servants, masters, partners, and victims. Just as man has attempted to tame the horse, the horse has transformed man, making him stronger, faster, more commanding. Artists have borrowed attributes of the horse to create new creatures, often endowed with magical powers. Though today horses are seldom part of our daily lives, they are rarely absent from our imaginations.",

    "exhibition_description": "In Somalia, poetry has long been the preferred medium for artistic expression—in fact, the country is sometimes called “the land of bards.” This is in part because of Somalia’s long Islamic tradition, which discourages the visual depiction of people while embracing the power of the spoken word. Yet Somali artists have also turned to other media, including drawing, painting, photography, and video.\r\n\r\nThis exhibition celebrates the work of three Somali visual artists from the Twin Cities: Hassan Nor (81), Aziz Osman (69), and Ifrah Mansour (30). Nor and Osman were born in Somalia and grew up there, migrating to the United States in the 1990s after the outbreak of civil war at home. Their drawings and paintings look to the past, depicting life in Somalia before the war and in transit, on the way to their new country. Mansour, on the other hand, was born in Saudi Arabia and raised in Minnesota. Her video addresses the cultural ignorance and stereotypes she encounters in her daily life. All three share stories of exile, memory, identity, pride, and resilience.",

Through face-to-face portrait sessions, the artist bonded with her sitters, building a relationship of friendship and mutual trust. The resulting paintings represent the diverse communities that live and work in Phillips and Whittier, some of whom are Latino and Somali immigrants. The exhibition will also feature video documentation of the painting process providing the audience with an intimate window into the community groups portrayed.\r\n\r\nBy representing individuals and communities that are under-represented in the history of art and have traditionally been underserved by public arts institutions, Nisenbaum seeks to empower her sitters and visitors alike, instilling in them an expanded sense of ownership and belonging to the museum. To that end, Cargill Gallery will be reimagined as a platform for dialogue and community exchange for the duration of the exhibition, providing a flexible space for programming by community members themselves.",

    "exhibition_description": "Before and after writing her famous children’s book Millions of Cats (1928), Wanda Gág was a printmaker, creating lithographs as intimate and exuberant as her books. Meanwhile, fellow Minnesotan Elizabeth Olds was writing herself into history by helping to transform screenprinting, traditionally a commercial process, into a medium for fine art. Her efforts, part of Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal program of arts patronage, enabled artists to put low-cost art in the hands of a mass audience.\r\n\r\nOlds’s prints used humor, satire, and a socially conscious viewpoint to document American life during the unsettled 1930s. Gág’s work came from a more private place: a spinning wheel, tree, or sleeping cat was enough to ignite her one-in-a-million imagination.\r\n\r\nThis exhibition celebrates these two Minnesota-grown artists with prints, drawings, and preparatory materials for their children’s books.",

    "exhibition_description": "George Morrison (1919–2000) was a renowned Anishinaabe modernist from Minnesota whose visionary work was inspired by the natural world, a profound sense of place, and Native American thought and culture. Morrison believed that nature, particularly the sky and water, held a spiritual vitality, a transcendent force that could be experienced through an aesthetic rooted in abstraction and surrealism. Emotive, personal, intuitive, and organic, Morrison’s approach was also deeply introspective, with Minnesota landscapes and the shoreline of Lake Superior serving as his principal subjects. Selected from the holdings of the Minneapolis Institute of Art, this exhibition highlights Morrison’s abiding interest in color, abstraction, the natural world, and creating art on an intimate scale. Featuring drawings in pen and ink, colored pencil, conté crayon, and gouache, the selection also includes several small acrylic horizon paintings.",

They have worked side by side their entire lives. Their focus on drawing and meticulous, painstaking process sets them apart. Each dedicates hundreds (and sometimes thousands) of hours to a single work, drawing skillfully, obsessively, until pencil has transformed paper into a provocative image rendered with photographic precision.\r\nAlthough the brothers use the same medium (graphite) and technique (photorealist) in their drawings, their subjects and approaches diverge. Bly concentrates on portraiture and nature. He scrutinizes the ordinary, overlooked, and seemingly banal to show such details of life are worthy of appreciation and artistic expression. Rowan focuses on narrative to examine a range of human emotions, a path that can lead to a chilling view of humanity. In their hyper-vivid depictions, both create haunting, memorable, and at times disturbing works of art.\r\nThe exhibition will feature a selection of their drawings, paintings, and works in process.",

    "exhibition_description": "Buddhism has been a dominant religious and intellectual force in China since it arrived from India around 100 C.E. Both literati and professional artists created Chinese Buddhist paintings.\r\nLiterati painters, scholars for whom painting was a form of intellectual and moral cultivation, created meditative scenes by incorporating Buddhist ideas into landscape painting. For painters who followed Chan (Zen) Buddhism, the expressive handling of ink evoked the sudden awareness that comes in moments of insight.\r\nProfessional artists generally focused on figurative paintings, including depictions of buddhas, bodhisattvas (nearly enlightened beings that stay on earth to help people), arhats (the original followers of the Buddha), and eminent monks. During the Qing dynasty (1644­–1911), the imperial patronage of esoteric Buddhism—the primary school of Tibetan Buddhism—resulted in a vast number of religious works in the Tibetan style. These paintings combine Tibetan attention to iconographic detail with Chinese-inspired decorative elements.",

Born near Grand Marais, Minnesota, Morrison trained in Minneapolis before moving to New York in 1943. Immersed in the culture of improvisation and experimentation in New York, Morrison gradually worked on a large scale and made thickly encrusted paintings shimmering with light and energy. This installation places Morrison’s Untitled (1960) painting in dialogue with artists he knew and exhibited with in the 1950s and 1960s, including Philip Guston, Grace Hartigan, and Louise Nevelson. Recently conserved, Morrison’s painting has not been on view at Mia for many decades. This installation reconnects Morrison’s work to midcentury modernism and reaches forward to suggest his legacy. A newly acquired piece by Andrea Carlson (Anishinaabe, Ojibwe, b. 1979), who early on received encouragement from Morrison, will also be on view for the first time.",

Using familiar materials like paper, wood, textiles, charcoal, and clay, the Minneapolis-based artist turns the gallery into a place where one may observe and listen to a conversation between our past selves and future experiences.\r\n\r\nJennifer Nevitt received a BFA from the Minneapolis College of Art and Design in 1996 and an MFA from the University of Minnesota in 2011. She is influenced by the idea that real life expands our concept of art, using painting, sculpture, and textiles to explore narratives pertaining to the human experience of dwelling and being.",

    "exhibition_description": "Few individuals have had as great an impact on Mia’s photography collection as Harry McClurg Drake. A dedicated philanthropist, Drake applied his humor, energy, and expansive intellect to collecting original works by internationally acclaimed photographers, including Ansel Adams, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Andre Kertesz, Irving Penn, Paul Strand, and Minor White. As a member of Mia’s Board of Directors, the St. Paul native relished opportunities to fortify Mia’s collection of modern photographs; when he died in 2012, his generous bequest to Mia included a collection of over 600 photographs. The striking portraits, landscapes, still lifes, and conceptual photographs selected for this exhibition illuminate the breadth of Drake’s remarkable gift to Mia.",

He is a recipient of the 2015 Jerome Foundation Fellowship for Emerging Artists, Minnesota States Arts Board. He was the lead exhibit designer of “We Are Hmong Minnesota,” at the Minnesota History Center, St. Paul.\r\n\r\nThis exhibition is part of the Minnesota Artists Exhibition Program, now located in U.S. Bank Gallery.",

    "exhibition_description": "“Vision 2020” presents contemporary photographic portraits created by three groundbreaking photographers from Africa: Samuel Fosso of Cameroon, Nigeria, and the Central African Republic; Zanele Muholi of South Africa; and Omar Victor Diop of Senegal. Each photographer uses their bodily presence within the photograph to different ends, yet they hold a common interest in exploring the layered histories of race and gender within these disparate representations; in doing so, they offer insight into visual resistance, communal care, and self-affirmation. Through costumes, props, sets, and other devices, these photographers present expansive, critical views of the history of the medium—and, in turn, of their roles as authors of historical narratives.",

The accompanying album grew from Mkali’s in-depth research on the work of each artist, and approaches their individual visual practice as a means to access and articulate a collective Black consciousness that transcends time and space. \r\n\r\nHere, images, words, and music combine to explore themes of identity, culture, spirituality and power through the embodiment of Black lived experience. As Chaka Mkali explains: \r\n\r\nRituals of Resilience <i>is about the act of survival under intense pressure and heat. A place to hide when being in your body isn’t safe. A reimagining of new worlds and possibilities. The creative culture of Indigenous and diasporic ethnic groups of African descent surviving and dismantling 400 years of white supremacy. . . through a visceral fabric of repetitious intentional movements, vibrations, gatherings, acts, symbols, and codes.</i>",

    "exhibition_description": "This exhibition focuses on four remarkable printmakers working in Italy around the year 1600. Each took a different path. Two were brothers, Agostino and Annibale Carracci. Promoting the study of live models and nature, they had a profound impact on artistic trends in Italy. Yet, their engagements with printmaking diverged. Agostino was a prolific, highly skilled professional engraver. Annibale preferred to spend his time making paintings, but for his limited output of prints he adopted the more intuitive technique of etching to produce works of exceptional sensitivity. Camillo Procaccini spent even less time on printmaking, but his few etchings resulted in visionary productions with powerfully emotional content. Andrea Andreani devoted his career to translating the works of other artists into complex woodcuts, sometimes of remarkable size. Several of the prints in this exhibition are here making their first appearance in Mia’s galleries.",

    "exhibition_description": "On March 24, 2020, Minneapolis-based artist Piotr Szyhalski embarked on a daily drawing practice responding to the COVID-19 pandemic as it unfolded in real time. What began as a way for the artist to share observations of life in lockdown and the pain caused by the pandemic quickly became a daily exercise of chronicling his thoughts and feelings and reconciling them with the changes being wrought in the world. \r\n\r\nCOVID-19: Labor Camp Report consists of 225 drawings created over eight months that fall under Szyhalski’s ongoing artistic framework, Labor Camp. New drawings were posted daily on Instagram, serving as a witness to the unfolding crisis and a record of time, both labored and lost. \r\n\r\nSzyhalski’s work addresses themes ranging from time, home, and resilience to misinformation, greed, authoritarianism, and police brutality. The series’ bold messages and images call us to action, ask us to question what is happening in our world, and most importantly, inspire hope and solidarity. \r\n\r\nWhile the pandemic is far from over, we hope COVID-19: Labor Camp Report offers you an opportunity to reflect on both the events of the past year and your own experiences of this turbulent moment.

    "exhibition_description": "In the male-dominated society of imperial China, women were sometimes compared to flowers in an isolated garden: they were blossoms flowering only in shadows. For most of their lives, women were physically restricted to domestic spaces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLiterature and illustrations of the period regularly represent the bedroom as the center of female life and of femininity itself. It was a space in which women gathered or sat alone to work, or to pursue leisurely activities such as reading, writing, sewing and playing music. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe furniture, artworks, and antiquities found within a noblewoman’s bedroom reflected her social status and showed her to be educated and well-read. But they also very much reflected her reality as a woman living in a man’s world, from a dressing table at which she prepared herself for the male gaze, to a bed that signaled her position as the legitimate partner to her husband.

    "exhibition_description": "<i>“A bridge divides what is “above” the bridge, what is “below” the bridge, what is “before” the bridge and what is “after” the bridge, but at the same time it brings totality and turns it into a neighborhood.”</i>\r\n– Siah Armajani\r\n\r\nIn 1960, at the urging of his family, Siah Armajani (Iranian American, 1939-2020) left his native Iran for the United States, landing in St. Paul where his uncle taught at Macalester College. The artist was an activist at a time of political upheaval in his native country and, for him, immigration was a political act. \r\n\r\nThe installation in this rotunda celebrates an important facet of Armajani’s career: the act of bridging. Ironically, bridges emphasize divisions even as they create connections. As an immigrant, Armajani understood his status as a metaphorical bridge between two cultures, and between two locations. For Armajani, the questions of citizenship and culture are deeply embedded in his works.",
