  "exhibition_description": "Selected from Miaâ€™s permanent collection, this exhibition highlights more than thirty works on paper by seven leading artists of Die Neuen Wilden, an informal group of Neo-Expressionist painters and printmakers active in Germany from the late 1960s to the early 1990s. Epitomized by the radical experiments of artist Georg Baselitz, German Neo-Expressionism has been described as bold, raw, brutish, spontaneous, messy, vital, emotional, sensual, antimodern, antiprogressive, and at times even nihilistic.",
