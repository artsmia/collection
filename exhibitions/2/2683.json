  "exhibition_description": "All Flowers in Bloom explores the new heights of artistry and technical skill that porcelain makers were able to achieve during China’s Qing Dynasty (1644–1911). Qing artists explored new techniques and innovations even as they revered the shapes and decoration of ancient Chinese bronzes. The porcelain on display here showcases the dramatically expanded color range of the era—including brilliant cherry red, pinkish grey, and luminous deep blue—as well as a new emphasis on the simple elegance of monochrome.",
