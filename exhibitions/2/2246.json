  "exhibition_description": "Eadweard Muybridge and Harold Edgerton were American pioneers of stop-action photography. Muybridge, working in the 1880s at the University of Pennsylvania, produced sequential images of humans and animals doing the mundane and the arcane. Edgerton, working in the middle of this century at MIT, experimented with early flash technology to freeze spectacular moments like a bullet shattering a light bulb. The exhibition included about 75 photographs (divided equally between the two), all drawn from the MIAâ€™s permanent collection.",
