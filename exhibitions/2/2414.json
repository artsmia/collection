  "exhibition_description": "Swearengin's sculptural practice focuses on understanding design and how it is implemented through a relationship between objects, humans and linguistics. Occupying a space between utility and poetics, function and message, his work looks to find meaningful discrepancies in design and architectural practices and explore how they have defined spatial relationships in politics and the history of sculpture.",
