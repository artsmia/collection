  "exhibition_title": "Emmett Ramstad: Touching Each Other",
  "exhibition_description": "Emmett Ramstad’s work explores the intimate ordinary. Shaped by an interest in queer archival practices, his sculptures originate from collections of donated objects such as toothbrushes, socks and underwear and become minimalist monuments to bodies and their detritus. His exhibition detaches grooming from the realm of the private and the domestic into the communal. Ramstad’s exhibition includes darning lessons in the Period Rooms and a daily sock sorting in the gallery.",
