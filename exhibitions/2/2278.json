  "exhibition_description": "In the 1930s, American poet Ezra Pound famously encouraged modern artists to “make it new.” Modernists did so through abstraction, 12 tone music, collage, photomontage, and other experimental approaches to the visual arts, film, dance, and architecture. Today, to make it absolutely new is almost impossible given the sheer quantity of art produced since Pound’s slogan. Still, contemporary artists certainly make art that is new, again. And historic artworks acquire new meanings in our time. This photography exhibition will feature a selection of recent museum acquisitions by Richard Avedon, Stan Douglas, Marco Breuer, and Margaret Bourke-White, among others – many will be presented in the MIA galleries for the first time – in an innovative installation that reveals how powerful images acquire new and provocative meanings in different historical situations.",
