  "exhibition_description": "“Vision 2020” presents contemporary photographic portraits created by three groundbreaking photographers from Africa: Samuel Fosso of Cameroon, Nigeria, and the Central African Republic; Zanele Muholi of South Africa; and Omar Victor Diop of Senegal. Each photographer uses their bodily presence within the photograph to different ends, yet they hold a common interest in exploring the layered histories of race and gender within these disparate representations; in doing so, they offer insight into visual resistance, communal care, and self-affirmation. Through costumes, props, sets, and other devices, these photographers present expansive, critical views of the history of the medium—and, in turn, of their roles as authors of historical narratives.",
