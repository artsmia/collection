  "exhibition_description": "Since the late 19th century, photographers have carried their cameras to unfamiliar neighborhoods and around the globe taking pictures of diverse people, places, and cultures. This exhibition features a range of classic masterpieces from the MIA’s collection that document photographers’ new encounters with foreign subjects and lands. The exhibition looks closely at how photographers translate a sense of culture, people, and place through imagery. It considers the power of photographic first impressions to shape historical representations of cultures that become lasting records of historical memory.",
