  "exhibition_title": "International Modernism: Art in a Fast-changing World",
  "exhibition_description": "By the early 1900s, people worldwide were transforming their habits, identities, and landscapes more dramatically than ever. Artists and designers, inspired by innovations such as radios, skyscrapers, and even the development of modern psychology, responded with cutting-edge representations of new and familiar subjects.\r\n“International Modernism” explores how this response to modern life evolved through much of the 20th century, from the 1910s through the early 1960s. Installed in stages from fall 2015 through mid-2016, “International Modernism” centers on objects from the Kunin Collection as well as paintings, prints, photography, and design from Mia’s collection.",
