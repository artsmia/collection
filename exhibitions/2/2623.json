  "exhibition_title": "Touring Japan through Landscape Prints by Kawase Hasui",
  "exhibition_description": "With more than 600 woodblock prints, Kawase Hasui was the most prolific print artist of his time. His success was based on his ability to capture Japanâ€™s beautiful scenery in compositions that could transform an ordinary village to an appealing vista. Hasui traveled through the country where he deliberately chose unusual spots along with idiosyncratic viewpoints of famous sights. This exhibition presents a kaleidoscope of his landscapes over a span of thirty years, starting with an example from his first set, published in 1918. It includes many examples of snow and rain scenes, which Hasui is especially famous for.",
