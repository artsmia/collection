  "exhibition_description": "Sexton is proposing to create a site-specific installation involving two primary spatial components in the MAEP gallery. In doing so, she hopes to reveal something about the nature of the void by not only making its walls pliable, but allowing them to succumb to superficiality and artifice as well. By diverting the boundaries of a space, Sexton enables us to mistrust artifice and seek what exists when the seams surrounding us become malleable to our perceptions. Places become like people, with walls that are permeable, fallible, sometimes scarred, yet, deep within lies the perfect ideology of geometry and nature.",
