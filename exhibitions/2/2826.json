  "exhibition_description": "Born and raised in Minneapolis, William Peter Kosmas (1940–2017) was a London-based attorney who devoted his practice to representing and advising contemporary artists, writers, and performers. Kosmas’s professional specialties dovetailed with his lifelong passion for collecting artists’ books and works on paper, resulting in an extensive personal collection of modern and contemporary art that was recently donated to Mia by the Kosmas estate. This exhibition will feature a selection of more than 60 artists’ books and original prints by prominent European, Japanese, and American artists and writers, reflecting Kosmas’s wide-ranging interests in art, poetry, and classical literature. The display includes important works by Joan Miró, Sigmar Polke, Georg Baselitz, Richard Hamilton, Shinro Ohtake, Federico García Lorca, Samuel Beckett, Josef Albers, Jim Dine, Jasper Johns, Betye Saar, and the German book artist Veronika Schäpers, among many others.",
