  "exhibition_description": "A pair of two silver statues by Neapolitan artist Giuseppe Sanmartino (1720-1793), donated to the museum by long-time trustees Al and Mary Agnes McQuinn, marks one of the most important additions to Mia's silver collection. Executed with amazing detail, the statues testify to a devotion to the two Archangels, which goes back to the Early Christian period, and continues to flourish in Southern Italy (as well as in the Greek and Russian Orthodox churches) to the present day. Throughout Christianity, Saint Michael and Saint Raphael are venerated for their healing powers. The exhibition celebrates the acquisition of these unique masterpieces, whose only comparables remain in Italian churches, but which have no parallels in any American museum collection.",
