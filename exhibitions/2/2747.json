  "exhibition_title": "Strong Women, Full of Love: The Photography of Meadow Muska",
  "exhibition_description": "This exhibition is the first to present the work of documentary photographer Carolyn “Meadow” Muska. Born and raised in Minnesota, Muska came out as a lesbian at age 20. After earning a BFA at Ohio University, she used photography to record her community of “beautiful, strong women, full of love and joy.” In an era of persistent legal and cultural prejudice against LGBTQ inviduals, documenting her community was a radical act. Because her photographs could expose her subjects to significant risks, including the loss of employment, child custody, or housing, she developed her own film in a basement darkroom for decades. The extraordinary photographic record she produced as a part of the women’s land movement in both Minnesota and Oregon, as well as her work as a labor and women’s rights activist, illuminates a new and vital chapter in American history.
