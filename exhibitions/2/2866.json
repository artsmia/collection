  "exhibition_description": "This exhibition highlights 50 years of photographic expression by a diverse roster of artists working within, against, and beyond the history of the medium: Nona Faustine, Martine Gutierrez, Deana Lawson, An-My Lê, Rania Matar, Lorraine O’Grady, Adrian Piper, Selma Fernandez Richter, Martha Rosler, Jovan Speller, Mickalene Thomas, Carrie Mae Weems, and Carmen Winant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpanning the past half-century in modern and contemporary photography, these photographs contend with many of the period’s defining issues, especially within the United States. They meditate upon the intersection of personal and political histories, newly interrogate matters of national identity and belonging, intentionally process cycles of trauma and promote healing, and imagine worlds beyond the inequalities of our time.",
