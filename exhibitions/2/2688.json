  "exhibition_title": "Harry Drake: A Legacy in Photography",
  "exhibition_description": "Few individuals have had as great an impact on Mia’s photography collection as Harry McClurg Drake. A dedicated philanthropist, Drake applied his humor, energy, and expansive intellect to collecting original works by internationally acclaimed photographers, including Ansel Adams, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Andre Kertesz, Irving Penn, Paul Strand, and Minor White. As a member of Mia’s Board of Directors, the St. Paul native relished opportunities to fortify Mia’s collection of modern photographs; when he died in 2012, his generous bequest to Mia included a collection of over 600 photographs. The striking portraits, landscapes, still lifes, and conceptual photographs selected for this exhibition illuminate the breadth of Drake’s remarkable gift to Mia.",
