  "exhibition_title": "Ernest Bryant III: The Life and Times of the Time Traveler",
  "exhibition_description": "Bryant is from Minnesota, yet he has spent a significant amount of time living abroad in Greece, Cuba and China. Life in those countries has allowed him to experience \"otherness\" outside of an American racial black/white binary. Bryant was able to examine how art is manifested in other cultures, and its influence on and reflection of their people. \r\n\r\nFor his MAEP exhibition, Bryant will expand a new body of work based on his experiences abroad. Illustrated in historicized images, paintings, maps, etchings and manuscripts that chronicle the experiences of the time traveler. By re-positioning the protagonist from the role of object to the central subject in history, Bryant questions our own understanding of cultural binaries. By flipping the protagonist from object to subject, we begin to question our interpretation of accepted historical images or objects, while simultaneously questioning the subversive brutality of contemporary human relationships.",
