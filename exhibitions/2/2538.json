  "exhibition_description": "Sexual desire and cinematic performance are filtered through the genres of still-life and portraiture in Joe Sinness’s body of work. For his MAEP exhibition, Sinness captures the beauty of communities traditionally viewed as aberrant.\r\n\r\nJuxtaposing portraits, still-lifes, theatrical sculptures, and cinematic panoramas, Sinness’s works display the performance of sexual desire. Drawing inspiration from vintage physique magazines, and iconic films like Cruising, starring Al Pacino, Sinness visualizes desire and pursues a vision of utopic queer spaces and characters—portraying his subjects as tender and worthy of desire.\r\n\r\nSinness received his BA from St. John’s University and an MFA from Minneapolis College of Art and Design. He was part of a group MAEP exhibition in 2010. The artist is a recipient of the 2013 Artist Initiative Grant from the Minnesota State Arts Board, 2013/14 McKnight Artist Fellowship for Visual Artists, and 2015 Fire Island Artist Residency.",
