  "exhibition_description": "Featuring about 60 photographs from Mia’s collection, this exhibition traces protests in select 20th-century movements and events that triggered important social and political changes, among them the Civil Rights Movement, Japan’s U.S. security treaty conflict, the Iranian Revolution, Vancouver’s Gastown riots, and the 1984 Democratic National Convention. Pushing against nostalgia, these pictures renew the question of narrative construction in a photograph of documentary nature, and suggest their relevance in today’s political, social, and racial conflicts. Featured photographers include Gordon Parks, Danny Lyon, Gilles Peress, Shomei Tomatsu, Thomas Arndt, and Stan Douglas. The photographs will be accompanied by two media installations: Waiting For Tear Gas (1999–2000) by Allan Sekula; and Untitled (Structures)(2012) by Leslie Hewitt in collaboration with Bradford Young.",
