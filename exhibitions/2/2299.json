  "exhibition_description": "In March 2015 it was announced that the Japanese art collection of St. Paul native Mary Griggs Burke, long considered the finest private collection of its kind outside of Japan, is bequeathed to the MIA and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. The MIA will highlight the breadth of this gift by presenting an exhibition that features more than 170 masterpieces of Japanese and Korean art, ranging from prehistoric to the late 19th century. Among the objects are stunning ink paintings like Kichizan Mincho's (1352–1431) interpretation of the bodhisattva Monju by the artist, a 16th-century water jar (mizusashi) known as \"Burst Bag\" from the kilns in Iga for use in tea ceremony, a pair of folding screens of hollyhocks and plum trees by the artist Ogata Kenzan (1663–1743), a pair of screens of Chinese children playing \"crack the whip\" and examining an elephant by the eccentric artist Nagasawa Rosetsu (1754–1799), and a luminous 12th-century celadon Korean maebyong vessel inlaid with a pattern ofa crane amid clouds.
