  "exhibition_description": "Eugène Delacroix was the very engine of revolution that helped transform the art of French painting in the nineteenth century. At his death in 1863, he was the most revered artist in Paris. The younger generation of painters from Edgar Degas to Vincent van Gogh scrambled to pay homage to his achievement and to explore his aesthetic theories, as articulated in his life’s work, much of which was accessible to the public, and in his incisive critical writings. If he was often described appropriately as the last painter of the Grand Style, he was equally one of the first modern masters and arguably the most influential artist of his epoch.\r\n This exhibition will investigate, through various thematic groupings of pictures, how and why this was so. The themes will range over some of the following: orientalism; color theory; religious and history painting at a crossroads; beasts, flowers and aestheticism; “musical” painting; and the artist’s own unpublished “Dictionary of Art.” \r\nIn addition to Delacroix, the exhibition will include works by Cézanne, Van Gogh, Gauguin, Renoir, and others.\r\nA significant number of paintings from the Minneapolis Institute of Art will form the core of the show, including Delacroix’s Fanatics of Tangiers, generally considered one of the principal masterworks by the artist in North America, van Gogh’s brilliant Olive Trees, and Signac’s initial pointillist work Snow, Boulevard de Clichy.",
