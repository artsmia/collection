  "exhibition_title": "Edgeworlds: Jamie Kinroy",
  "exhibition_description": "Born in Edinburgh, Scotland, Jamie Kinroy visited Japan before calling Minneapolis home. His multicultural experiences collide within the artificial landscapes that he has illustrated for “Edgeworlds.” While he is inspired by the history of illustration, Kinroy rejects linear narrative. Instead, he focuses on intricately designed locations or environments. Each print, drawing, and painting becomes a window onto a familiar but undefinable scene that has the potential for infinite narratives.",
