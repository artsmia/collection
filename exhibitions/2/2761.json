  "exhibition_description": "The exhibition Rethinking Histories, is a survey of Mia’s contemporary collection. Told through quotes and video interviews, the exhibition takes a step back and explains why artists create works about history. In rethinking how we shape historical narratives and artifacts, the exhibition provides an accessible entry point to the contemporary collection and ignites the viewer to carry this line of investigation as they view other collections at the museum.",
