  "exhibition_description": "How do we address the future while processing the loss of the past? Jennifer Nevittâ€™s installations, paintings, and sculpture reference spaces of transition, both physically and psychologically. Using familiar materials like paper, wood, textiles, charcoal, and clay, the Minneapolis-based artist turns the gallery into a place where one may observe and listen to a conversation between our past selves and future experiences.\r\n\r\nJennifer Nevitt received a BFA from the Minneapolis College of Art and Design in 1996 and an MFA from the University of Minnesota in 2011. She is influenced by the idea that real life expands our concept of art, using painting, sculpture, and textiles to explore narratives pertaining to the human experience of dwelling and being.",
