  "exhibition_title": "Dorothea Lange: American Photographs",
  "exhibition_description": "This exhibition was the first major retrospective of Lange’s work to look not only at her early documentary work during the Depression, but also her work documenting important wartime changes in California such as the relocation of Japanese-Americans and the operation of fast-growing war industries in Richmond, California. Approximately 90 - 100 photographs were exhibited, most of them vintage and many of which had never before been exhibited or published. This was the first solo exhibition of Lange’s work to be seen at The Minneapolis Institute of Arts. The exhibition was accompanied by an illustrated catalogue.",
