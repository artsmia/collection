  "exhibition_description": "Martin Luther: Art and the Reformation will examine the life and influence of Martin Luther through the lens of artistic creation. Spectacular works from Luther’s personal possessions, paintings and prints by the extraordinary master Lucas Cranach, fabulous objects wrought in silver and gold, and sumptuous embroideries will be among the objects revealing the artistic, spiritual, and intellectual vitality of the time.\r\nThe Minneapolis Institute of Art has been selected as the exclusive U.S. venue to showcase this stunning exhibition of over 100 objects. This opportunity is being made possible due to the closing of the Luther House in Wittenberg in 2016 to undertake renovations in preparation for the Jubilee Year in 2017. The inventory of the Luther House, which is the world’s largest Reformation history museum, has never been on tour in such a comprehensive manner. The German government has fully endorsed the project, in recognition of its importance, and with the certainty that visitors will come away with a tangible awareness of this pivotal moment in history—a moment when a man took a stand that turned the world upside down.",
