  "exhibition_description": "Alyssa Baguss will construct three distinct artworks that explore how we experience the outdoors as mediated technology. This exhibition will consider nature as scenery, our persistent longing to be elsewhere, and our perception of place through secondary experiences.\r\n\r\nBagussâ€™s practice explores mediated natural environments through the drawing processes. She is a 2015 and 2017 recipient of the Minnesota State Arts Board Artist Initiative Grant and the recipient of the 2017/18 Jerome Foundation Fellowship for Emerging Artists. Her work has been exhibited at the Rochester Art Center, Minnesota Center for the Book Arts, and Minnesota Museum of American Art.",
