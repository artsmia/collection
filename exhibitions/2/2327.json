  "exhibition_title": "Lindsay Rhyner: Material Worlds",
  "exhibition_description": "Lindsay Rhyner’s textile wall hangings are loosely based on found-photographs and postcards from the 1940’s. The imagery depicted in the postcards and photographs is of a seemingly idyllic time. Pictures of exotic places, agriculture, war, tourism and monuments were rendered in oversaturated color and rigid composition. A window to a perfect world which never existed. By translating these worlds into fabric and using reflective materials, like sequins, reflective fabrics, and rhinestones, Rhyner forces us to look beyond the frozen image and to take a closer look at the materiality of the wall hangings themselves.",
