  "exhibition_description": "<b>Chinese Lacquer from Mia: Motifs and Techniques</b>\r\n\r\nMaking art with lacquer has a long history in China, beginning over 5,000 years ago, but it was only in the late imperial period (1400s- 1800s), that Chinese craftsmen fully explored its decorative properties by carving, incising, and gilding lacquer surfaces as well as inlaying mother-of-pearl and other materials. Richly decorated lacquer wares often invoke themes and ideas meant to bring wealth, health, moral ethics, good luck, longevity, and even immortality to their ownersâ€”and also communicate their wealth and status. This installation showcases a wide variety of forms, styles, and techniques, as well as an array of themes that even today remain significant in Chinese culture.",
