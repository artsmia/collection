  "exhibition_description": "“I believe in the alchemy of the word, the iconography of the text, the labyrinth of the book.”—Harriet Bart\r\n\r\nVisual artist Harriet Bart explores themes of commemoration, remembrance, and loss through her multidisciplinary work. Books and language lie at the heart of her practice, one informed by an abiding fascination with the personal and collective expression of memory. Bart describes herself as a cultural storyteller, drawing on historical events, literary sources, and other narratives to shape meaning and engender empathy for her subjects. Conceptually rich and aesthetically refined, her books and works on paper are highly original evocations of the human condition. This solo presentation includes examples of Bart’s artist’s books, drawings, collages, editioned prints, and related objects representing three decades of the artist’s career.",
