  "exhibition_description": "The first half of the 20th century was a time of enormous changes in American life. Industrial growth, unprecedented scientific and technological developments, and progressive social and financial reforms resulted in a higher standard of living, an expanded middle class, and greater levels of self-determination for both men and women. At the same time, global wars, economic depression, and racial and religious conflict produced suffering for many. These turbulent decades prompted insightful, often impassioned, responses from American artists whose perspectives conveyed many of the hopes, dreams, and fears of the public at large. This exhibition presents more than 45 original prints, drawings, and watercolors by such leading figures as John Sloan, George Bellows, Charles Burchfield, Thomas Hart Benton, John Steuart Curry, Grant Wood, Rockwell Kent, Reginald Marsh, Leo Katz, Elizabeth Catlett, Rico Lebrun, Ben Shahn, and many more.",
