  "exhibition_title": "A History of Photography from Mia's Collection",
  "exhibition_description": "This exhibition presents a brief history of photography through selections from Mia’s collection of 12,500 photographs. Acting as “windows” on scenes that likely would have remained unseen without the benefits of photographic technology, the images reflect the medium’s ability to turn the familiar or hidden into unfamiliar, thought-provoking, evocative, and even iconic moments. Challenging a linear history of photography that began in the 1820s, this collection suggests the timelessness and timeliness of the images’ subjects as well as the global transmission and dissemination of the medium.",
